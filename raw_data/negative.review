I ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two.  After applying one vial, it seemed even worse than before.  (Tread "catches" as I walk.)  So I applied the second vial just to make it usuable.  (Still not great.)  This stuff is overpriced and either they don't give you enough or it's poor quality

This stuff has a very strong smell -- like WD-40 or something.  If you can stand the smell, you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store -- at least then you'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt.

I bought this stuff because I thought it would be odorless, like all other treadmill lubricant I've bought.  But it isn't odorless.  It really stinks.  I don't like that permeating smell in my house, especially in my workout room.

I recommend the LifeSpan 100% silicone lubricant.  It's a little pricier for the quantity you receive, but it's the good (odorless) stuff

I purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine. Unfortunetly, the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical. I would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment

This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you.
My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item. 
Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it.
I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper)
Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap. Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl. Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it.
I don't think no one will die from this type of trick

I consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds.  I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big.  I think that for a "small" backpack, that they are just too large.  Thank you

I purchased the ab lounge 2 online, but returned it the same day.

It's too bulky & heavy.  I wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news, but it's too heavy to move around, and it DOES NOT FOLD.   I put it together in my living room, and then tried to get it into my bedroom BUT IT WOULDN'T FIT THROUGH THE DOOR.  I had to un-screw the bars, fold & pull it through the door.

If I had put the AB Lounge 2 downstairs, then I would never use it.

Unless you want the "AB LOUNGE 2" to be a "PERMANENT" fixture in your bedroom or living room, then I would order something else.

I need this thing to be where I can easily use it & then put it away.......The Ab Lounge 2 is way too big & bulky for that.

Unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture, then don't buy it.

I'm buying the "Ultra" Ab Lounge because it folds for easy storage....It's more expensive, but to me it's worth the convenience of having the "EASY" storage capability.

I don't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it's not in use.

I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.
I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.

This product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit.  What it doesn't say is that you really get a workout.  No matter what incline it is in, it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil.  If you want a strenuous workout, then this unit is for you.  If you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface, then this is NOT the unit for you

I guess you get what you pay for.

This pedometer was difficult to calibrate, and continued to miscount steps, and therefore distance, covered.

It is made of plastic, and came unclipped easily.

I am a big person, and have started walking to improve my health. This product does not work for me, although it might be a different story for a slim person.

It has been relegated to the junk drawer, and probably will eventually be thrown away. I'll have to find another that works better and purchase it

Initially, the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate. It did, however, give my wife a good laugh; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the TV remote. But after one week of use, the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when I jumped up and down like a pogo stick. Pass on this one

I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.  

The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.   

The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.)

Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.  

This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue

We bought our machine 2 weeks ago. It looks wonderful, nice sturdy, with alot of different features, but we haven't been able to use it. It didn't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with Ironman's Customer Service Department ever since. They keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up. Evertime we call their 1800 number we're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day. Well after 2 weeks, we've had it! We're taking it back and never buying another Ironman product again. They're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they won't get anyone out there to fix it? Nothing against the store, they've been great. Just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer

The first time I used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they're made out of cracked in three different places.  Perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely, but I'm not going to risk an injury finding out.  In the trash they go... I suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing

This does not fit on Super 9 rifles as far as I know.  Besides, it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny! (Most scopes are whatever zoom X30. For example, I own a 3-9X44 scope. This means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom.  The second number refers to the size of the scope lens.  I'd seriously reccomend a 3X30 if you can get one.  Also make sure it's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail.  If you are getting it for the Super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight (peephole)

I purchased this bike rack because I was moving out of state and didn't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike.  
I also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails, parks, etc.  So, I went with Schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive.  

I drove from NC to Fla, approx 700 miles, bad idea with this rack.  I didn't have any trouble assembling the rack, only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go.  However, during my trip, I had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back.  The buckles do NOT hold the straps in place.  This is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway (or any busy road) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic.  Also, even if the buckles hold, The wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame.  I had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back (and yes, the rack was assembled correctly).  Bottom line, this rack is probably a great value if don't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph, otherwise, it is a a complete waste.

I bought this model a year ago, and replaced the deck after approximately 8 months.  Just recently, the deck cracked again.  Of course the warrantly no longer applies.  Save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and spend a little extra to upgrade to a better brand.

I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.
I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.

Billy is great, full of energy and enthusiam.  I get great results from his workout much better than any other instructor. My family get great results from his workout.  His customer service rep were helpful.

HOWEVER, I strongly, strongly recommend ordering your Taebo products through Amazon.  I've been doing business with Amazon many years and have placed over 150 orders.  I never, never once had any problems with my orders at Amazon.  When I had questions, it's amazing at not only how quick Amazon will reply but will give a long thorough and kind explanation.  Because they reply within a day and take so much time with the response, it shows they truly care for you and want to give you the best service possible.  I've never found customer service of this  very high and rare quality.

In November of 2005, after ordering the Billy Bands from the official Billy Bank's website.  I was sent a package, without my permission from the company that contained Billy's energy formula supplements.  It was a 14 day delayed bill for 31.85.  I was upset this was sent without me knowing but here's the worse part.  I contacted customer service, a gentleman told me don't worry you haven't been billed just send us back the package and we'll credit you $5 into your account for the shipping, packaging, and mailing cost you pay out of your own pocket to have the items sent back.  Within a few days I send the product I never requested back.  Twice by phone and once by email from 3 different cust rep I was told I would receive a $5 credit to my bank account within 7 to 10 days.

I was already upset about this matter but it wasn't that big of a concern.  However, about 2 weeks well over 10 days I never received the $5 credit to my account.  But there was a charge taken from their company without my permisson or authorization from my own personal bank account for $8.97 .  A few days later the $8.97 was put back into my account.

When I contacted the company this is their reply: 
Thank you for your recent e-mail. We apologize for the inconvenience. Our records show that your vitamin shipment was on a 14 day delay billing cycle (I sent the item I never wanted back in 7 days not over the 14 day limit). This means that when the charges actually went through, you were only charged for a small portion of the amount that showed on the invoice (I kept the copy and nowhere on the invoice is this stated). You received a credit for the shipping and handling plus 5.00 dollars to ship it back too. This means, when the charge for the vitamins actually went through you were only charged for 8.97. This is also the refund that you have received, the amount paid (again since the item was sent back within 14 days I shouldn't have been charged and nowhere on the invoice is this stated that I would only be charged a small portion).

So basically they sent me a product I never requested.  Told me they would give me some money to have the product sent back.  Took money from my bank account without me knowing and paid me back with my own money they stolen.

To sum it up, do business with Amazon!

I bought the set in a rush without reading the reviews, big mistake! The Cardio Boot Camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing.  The beginner boot camp is boring though the advanced is challenging fun.  If I knew what wasn't included I wouldn't have bought it.  They should list what's not included in the description.  It seems somewhat deceptive

I bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching TV...

I wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive.  What it boils down to is that this is a "foot hook" tied to a bar with a nylon strap.  The nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly.  The idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches...the problem is that the nylon strap doesn't actually hold your feet down.  I wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room.  Negative on both accounts.  You need a good sturdy door to implement this product, and then it still doesn't truly hold your feet down.  

Looks like I'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down

Rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea - an essential part of any family's emergency kit (and ecologically smart to boot). While this product is satisfactory for, say, a science demonsration on the Faraday Principle, its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited. 

To its credit: This flashlight was meant to last, and will stand extremes of water and temperature. When dropped into water, it will float beam-side up for easy retrieval. It's so sturdy tha, it will likely last for the lifetime of the user - and you can't say that about too many products. 

Shake this light for a while, and a disk of rare earth conducts enough current to sustain a light for a small amount of time. While you may read claims of up to one or two hours, a faint but workable current only lasts for about ten minutes, and then you shake again. And again. As long as you don't mind the repetition, the wan stream of bluish light will serve your purposes in a blackout or some other emergency. But don't entertain thoughts that you'll be able to read, find small objects, or perform any kind of detail work.

If you don't have a chance to compare this to its better competition, you might not know that say, the Sherpa Xray offers a well-focused beam you can read by. While no rechargeable can give you the kind of illumination you'll find in a traditional flashlight, your options are brighter if you stay away from the Diamond Gen. Invest in something more powerful and you'll find that a flashlight's usefulness becomes considerably greater. 

This flashlight was disappointing, and useless in any practical context

EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT, November 22, 2005
Reviewer:	AGNAZZO (Tampa, Florida United States) - See all my reviews
LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS. THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW. AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER. THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING. THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE. LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS.THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT

This stuff has a very strong smell -- like WD-40 or something.  If you can stand the smell, you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store -- at least then you'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt.

I bought this stuff because I thought it would be odorless, like all other treadmill lubricant I've bought.  But it isn't odorless.  It really stinks.  I don't like that permeating smell in my house, especially in my workout room.

I recommend the LifeSpan 100% silicone lubricant.  It's a little pricier for the quantity you receive, but it's the good (odorless) stuff

I purchased the ab lounge 2 online, but returned it the same day.

It's too bulky & heavy.  I wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news, but it's too heavy to move around, and it DOES NOT FOLD.   I put it together in my living room, and then tried to get it into my bedroom BUT IT WOULDN'T FIT THROUGH THE DOOR.  I had to un-screw the bars, fold & pull it through the door.

If I had put the AB Lounge 2 downstairs, then I would never use it.

Unless you want the "AB LOUNGE 2" to be a "PERMANENT" fixture in your bedroom or living room, then I would order something else.

I need this thing to be where I can easily use it & then put it away.......The Ab Lounge 2 is way too big & bulky for that.

Unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture, then don't buy it.

I'm buying the "Ultra" Ab Lounge because it folds for easy storage....It's more expensive, but to me it's worth the convenience of having the "EASY" storage capability.

I don't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it's not in use.

Got the mat for free for ordering the Series 7 treadmill and while putting the mat under my treadmill it ripped.  It is made by this rubbery plastic, and it's just okay.  I wouldn't pay $100 for it, it's true, but I was very disappointed that it ripped so easily.  Not very durable... but I got mine for free, so I guess I wasn't too surprised it was given away.

I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.
I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.

This product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit.  What it doesn't say is that you really get a workout.  No matter what incline it is in, it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil.  If you want a strenuous workout, then this unit is for you.  If you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface, then this is NOT the unit for you

I guess you get what you pay for.

This pedometer was difficult to calibrate, and continued to miscount steps, and therefore distance, covered.

It is made of plastic, and came unclipped easily.

I am a big person, and have started walking to improve my health. This product does not work for me, although it might be a different story for a slim person.

It has been relegated to the junk drawer, and probably will eventually be thrown away. I'll have to find another that works better and purchase it

Initially, the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate. It did, however, give my wife a good laugh; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the TV remote. But after one week of use, the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when I jumped up and down like a pogo stick. Pass on this one

I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.  

The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.   

The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.)

Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.  

This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue

We bought our machine 2 weeks ago. It looks wonderful, nice sturdy, with alot of different features, but we haven't been able to use it. It didn't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with Ironman's Customer Service Department ever since. They keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up. Evertime we call their 1800 number we're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day. Well after 2 weeks, we've had it! We're taking it back and never buying another Ironman product again. They're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they won't get anyone out there to fix it? Nothing against the store, they've been great. Just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer

The first time I used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they're made out of cracked in three different places.  Perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely, but I'm not going to risk an injury finding out.  In the trash they go... I suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing

This does not fit on Super 9 rifles as far as I know.  Besides, it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny! (Most scopes are whatever zoom X30. For example, I own a 3-9X44 scope. This means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom.  The second number refers to the size of the scope lens.  I'd seriously reccomend a 3X30 if you can get one.  Also make sure it's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail.  If you are getting it for the Super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight (peephole)

I purchased this bike rack because I was moving out of state and didn't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike.  
I also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails, parks, etc.  So, I went with Schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive.  

I drove from NC to Fla, approx 700 miles, bad idea with this rack.  I didn't have any trouble assembling the rack, only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go.  However, during my trip, I had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back.  The buckles do NOT hold the straps in place.  This is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway (or any busy road) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic.  Also, even if the buckles hold, The wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame.  I had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back (and yes, the rack was assembled correctly).  Bottom line, this rack is probably a great value if don't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph, otherwise, it is a a complete waste.

I bought this model a year ago, and replaced the deck after approximately 8 months.  Just recently, the deck cracked again.  Of course the warrantly no longer applies.  Save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and spend a little extra to upgrade to a better brand.

I ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two.  After applying one vial, it seemed even worse than before.  (Tread "catches" as I walk.)  So I applied the second vial just to make it usuable.  (Still not great.)  This stuff is overpriced and either they don't give you enough or it's poor quality

I bought the set in a rush without reading the reviews, big mistake! The Cardio Boot Camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing.  The beginner boot camp is boring though the advanced is challenging fun.  If I knew what wasn't included I wouldn't have bought it.  They should list what's not included in the description.  It seems somewhat deceptive

This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you.
My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item. 
Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it.
I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper)
Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap. Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl. Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it.
I don't think no one will die from this type of trick

I consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds.  I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big.  I think that for a "small" backpack, that they are just too large.  Thank you

I returned this item, as it didn't fit my 19-pound Boston Terrier well at all. It was way too large for his body. "Small" obviously means small for a larger dog instead. Just be aware!

I bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching TV...

I wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive.  What it boils down to is that this is a "foot hook" tied to a bar with a nylon strap.  The nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly.  The idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches...the problem is that the nylon strap doesn't actually hold your feet down.  I wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room.  Negative on both accounts.  You need a good sturdy door to implement this product, and then it still doesn't truly hold your feet down.  

Looks like I'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down

Rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea - an essential part of any family's emergency kit (and ecologically smart to boot). While this product is satisfactory for, say, a science demonsration on the Faraday Principle, its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited. 

To its credit: This flashlight was meant to last, and will stand extremes of water and temperature. When dropped into water, it will float beam-side up for easy retrieval. It's so sturdy tha, it will likely last for the lifetime of the user - and you can't say that about too many products. 

Shake this light for a while, and a disk of rare earth conducts enough current to sustain a light for a small amount of time. While you may read claims of up to one or two hours, a faint but workable current only lasts for about ten minutes, and then you shake again. And again. As long as you don't mind the repetition, the wan stream of bluish light will serve your purposes in a blackout or some other emergency. But don't entertain thoughts that you'll be able to read, find small objects, or perform any kind of detail work.

If you don't have a chance to compare this to its better competition, you might not know that say, the Sherpa Xray offers a well-focused beam you can read by. While no rechargeable can give you the kind of illumination you'll find in a traditional flashlight, your options are brighter if you stay away from the Diamond Gen. Invest in something more powerful and you'll find that a flashlight's usefulness becomes considerably greater. 

This flashlight was disappointing, and useless in any practical context

EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT, November 22, 2005
Reviewer:	AGNAZZO (Tampa, Florida United States) - See all my reviews
LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS. THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW. AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER. THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING. THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE. LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS.THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT

The wood is very nice - but the design/ manufacturing is very poor.

My experience trying to assemble this rack was frustrating.  The holes aren't properly pre-drilled.  The hole at the top didn't match up with the cap-plate hole, which A) made it very difficult to screw together (the first screw stripped) and B) resulted in a gap and wobbly finally assembly.  I experienced the same issue with shallow pre-drilled holes in the bottom, and the bolts not going in all the way. 

I never got to the point of figuring out the cryptic finally assembly instructions.  Based on the wobbly central column, I decided to disassemble mine and send it back.

When I was assembling this product I discovered that not only were the instructions vague, and that the product pictured did not appropriately match the product given, but that the product itself was sloppily manufactured.  The predrilled holes were only half the depths that the instructions required them to be in order to properly assemble and adjust the final height.  My thought is... How hard is it to drill a hole to a proper depth?

Luckily I own the tools necessary to fix their mistakes, but how much money are they really saving by inconveniencing their customers?

I wish I could give this product a higher rating, but hopefully there are better alternatives

I bought these skates last year, with the plans of putting outdoor wheels on them.  When I tried to take the wheels off, they wouldn't budge!  Spend the extra $50 on a pair of quality skates that you can keep for years.  When the  *indoor* wheels on these die, the skates die too.  These most definitely are not roller derby skates, since those girls change their wheels all the time!

I bought these skates for my daughter from Sport Authority.  Since we both wear the same size, I decided I would try and skate in them after my daughter.  She complained the wheels would not roll and when I tried to loosen them with a skate tool, they wouldn't loosen at all.  I tried to skate in them as well and I almost fell on my face.  I wasn't expecting the same quality as my professional skates, but at least hoped for skates that rolled safely!

I am a HUGE ski person and I got the jump it is so small for me because I am do like 50 feet drops all the time.
___________________MY SUGGESTION___________________

This is good for you starting your kid out on there first scooter they got for the holidays or skate board what ever you get him and its good for those things. Not Ideal what so ever for skiing. I got it to practice low ground tricks like a 180 at least so go for it if you are doing it for your son or daughter with there first scooter or bike or skateboard NOT skiing

There was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts. My son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road. He could not. It is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface

this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard. First of all, i thought this would be a bit larger. When i tried to go off of the ramp, my nose hit the front of it. 
Not only is it not fun, but you need to weigh it down if you dont want to slide around. If you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard,i recommend something else.

Not very bright for an LED.  AND, guess what? This is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes!
Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack.
I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this.

I got four boxes of these matches so I was motivated to learn how to use them.  I had read the directions about poking them into the lid.  I tried stroking and poking at various angles and finally got one to light after about 10 minutes.  It burned down to the wood portion and went out.  Incidentally, these matches are very short. Perhaps one is supposed to light them with a lighter

 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. 

Why by a gun from these guys? If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back. Want a refund? You pay a 15% restocking fee. Take a pass on Airsplat.

The title pretty much says it all.  The bag is solid and didn't get too soft even after a good amount of use.  The big downside is that the metal clasps that are used to hang up the bag are of extremely poor quality and can't support the weight of the bag. One of the clasps actually broke in two and two of the others became bent beyond usability.  All within about six months of use.  Unless you're prepared to spot weld the clasps to reinforce them I'd look elsewhere for a heavy bag.

I was so frustrated with those so called "sticky mats", my hands would slide forward in simple poses like downward facing dog. 
So I decided to give the $50 skidless yoga towel a try.
This worked pretty well for my slipping hands, but i had a new problem.  I was unable to get traction for my feet and felt as though they would slip up when in many of the commonly practiced poses in yoga.  (downward facing dog, even poses like triangle and extended side angle).  I really tried giving this towel a chance but ended up purchasing a harmony yoga mat (those rubber mats) which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences.
I would not recommend the skidless towel for your entire mat, maybe you may have better luck with just the hand towel.
I realized with yoga mats that every person is different, so what doesn't work for me, may work for you.  I just thought I would give my 2 cents

I bought the CycleOps Wind Indoor Trainer to train at home when I can't hit the road because of work (or weather) complications. If you are like me that means weekdays late at night, or very early in the morning. 

I'm terribly frustrated because I can't use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes. My neighbors can't stand it. Hey, I can't stand it! The noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner. To give you an idea, I don't even hear the music from my iPod while riding this thing. 

Don't buy it! Go for the magnetic resistance models.

For $20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking/jogging, with a bonus pedometer.  The radio has no channel display, and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial, then a scan button.  When walking, it loses the station occasionally - luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial, but if yours isn't this could be terribly annoying.  As for the pedometer, it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband, and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when I was holding it perfectly still - thus worthless.  I'm sending it back

I'm a big fan of Topeak's gear. I own two of their racks, couple of pumps, bags, etc. I use the MTX trunk bag/panniers to commute, and I live in Florida so I needed rain cover. I purchased this, and to my surprise----Topeak failed to include a strap for a rear blinkie. Yes, the cover is yellow. Yes, there's a reflective triangle. But that's not the same as a blinkie. Gee, Topeak, do you think people might want to run a blinkie in the rain? Stupid lack of planning.

This software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit.  I am sending the gps i just purchased, along with this software, back to amazon.  The software will not communicate with the gps, and the company will not respond to any of my support requests, the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available, and the live technical support is a complete joke.  After 20 minutes of being on hold, I spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english, and offered me no help... I knew more about the software than him, and i've only owned it 3 days.  I'll never purchase from Magellan again

Overall poor quality in craftsmanship. One can clearly see the glue that holds the gold trim in place, and on mine the trim on the handles was loose and could be easily removed. The wood is of subpar quality as well. The price is low; however, I would not recommend these swords

Please don't waste your hard earned money on this awful toy. It is tiny! The "hinges" and lock had worn marks on the plastic even before opening the product so you know they will break off soon. The "jewels" never sink, either.

Interestingly, PoolToy doesn't list the size of this product. In fact they don't give much information at all which is very misleading and disappointing. What a rip off. I hope Amazon discontinues its association with this company. Look at the feedback record for them. It's as terrible as this toy is

If you order this sword, you may not get what you see. Yes you will get the same 'style' of sword, but as for the look, forget it, the steel is pure black. Now if that's what you want great, I personally wanted the 'silver' steel look, but got the 'jet black' steel. Don't worry, it was the same sword, just a different color.

Expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order. Tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail.  Refused package a month ago.  Exorbitant charge made to my credit card and I will have to seek resolution with them, since Amazon takes no responsibility.  Vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel/refund order.

AMAZON PLACES ORDERS WITH SKETCHY VENDORS LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU'RE STUCK WITH ERRONEOUS CHARGES.  BEWARE!!

Amazon has the brand mislabeled as Apex, but it is Ipex. Cardboard box arrived spilt open and plastic carrying case was cracked--obviously it was never intended to hold so much weight. The rubber handles are very hard and already coming apart. The "chrome" paint is already peeling before even one use. Also, buyers should be aware that you can only increase the weight in 5lb increments, and if you plan on using both dumbbells at the same time, the maximum weight on each is 15lbs (If i would have thought about it, when I purchased it I would have realized both of these). Overall very poor quality. I will try to return

Although they claim that this item can be used by adults, it is the furthest thing from the truth.  You can only fill the black bottom HALF up with water, which you wouldn't know until you buy it.  Due to this, you can't do any combonations with this bag as you knock on its' side with even the most mild of punches. Also, after a few hits, it rips open like your fists were made of nails even with gloves on.  

The only reason why this purchase was made was due to the fact that I have no where to hang my actual heavybag in my apartment. This is not even remotely a replacment for a real bag.  Save your twenty five dollars for something else

I bought this for our camping trip to the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee.  The valve on this matress has a little flap on the inside that is supposed to stop air from coming out while you're securing the screw-on valve.  Unfortunatly, the design of the pump is such that you have a plastic nozzle that pushes the flap back to far to shut properly.

What this means is that you pump it up nice and firm, but the flap does not properly prevent air from escaping while you secure the valve cover. So you end up with not nearly as firm a matress as you would otherwise have.  

I will say that the mattress did stay at the the less than firm inflation point while we slept on it overnight, and the pump was robust and quick. However, the valve flap problem is serious enough that I am returning the product

Works as advertised, except...  One of the attachment straps broke the 3rd day.  No particular stress applied or anything.  I'm going to Allen to see if I can get a replacement.  

That was my only complaint.  Otherwise, it's fine.  Then again, breaking on the 3rd use is a big complaint

     The frame seems to be the only thing of any quality on this bike.  I have owned this for three months so far and have had to replace the shifter, derailer, brakes and other small items.  This bike is NOT Schwinn's usual quality.  Very disapointin

If you just like the cruiser look and will use the bike only occasionally for very short rides (less than 10 miles) then this is probably not a bad bike. BUT, if you want a much more comfortable and efficient bike, and one that will fit your body properly, go to your local bike shop and ask to see their "hybrid" bikes. This type of bike gets its name from being a cross between a "road bike" and a "mountain bike" or "all terrain" bike. They are available in several frame sizes, so you're not stuck with "one-size-fits-all", which is NOT good if you are shorter than about 5'7 or taller than about 5'10. Hybrids are available in a wide range of prices and equipment selections. The price will range from just over $200 to as high as you want to go (over $1500 anyway). As the price goes up, the weight generally goes down and the quality of the frame and all components goes way up. But even at the low end of the scale, a hybrid will be a much more efficient bike to ride (more miles covered per energy expended) and it will be more comfortable on longer rides (over 10 miles). If you are truly interested in covering some longer distances (up to maybe 30-40 miles) focus on the models that feature 700C wheels as opposed to 26-inch--your bike shop person can explain--and keep the tire width down to 35mm or under (28mm is a good size for most people if they ride only on pavement). The narrower tires offer less "rolling resistance" making the bike easier to pedal and the larger wheel sizes improves efficiency a little also.

Happy peddaling,
A VERY experienced cyclis

though i can say the item was nice when i got it

This compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers.  The pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break.  The card (actual compass part that spins) wobbles a lot so it's difficult to get an exact bearing.  It is like the oil in the compass is very thin.  Also, the direction line lid spins easily, making it possible to take a bad reading.  Ironically, this is the Silva weakness as well.


If you need an inexpensive engineer style compass, consider the Silva.  For a two more dollars, you get an aluminum case, a hinge that won't break and a card that doesn't wobble with the slightest hand movement

I was tired of the rental skates and wanted to be able to zip around the floor with my kids at the skating rink.  So I bought these skates.  At the time, it felt a little impulsive to spend so much on skates.  Well, now I know I should have spent more and at least be happy with what I purchased.

I had such a hard time skating with these skates, and when I talked to the guy at the pro shop and 2 people online (there are a lot of resources online-do a search for quad skates) I realized these skates were made for beginning kids, never a 36 year old mom!  They are not made to do the kind of things on the floor you think you might be able to do.  In fact, I couldn't even turn.  I kept having to push off because they would slow down.  I kept adjusting them and had a professional at the rink adjust them for me, and forget it!  I'm selling them at the resale shop and spending more money to at least get something decent

I think they are too stiff for comfort.  I do like the short finger, but the material over the back of the hand is too stiff. I thought it would stretch out and soften a bit. But it hasn't.  Protects the hands well through off road trails though.

This gun was okay when I first started using it. It's really a backyard gun, and should only be used for beginners. I had it on my bed, which is about two feet high, and it fell when my dog jumped on, the barrel broke. The spring in the magazine also broke. There are better guns out there, but if you just want to have some good clean fun in your backyard, this is the gun for you. The sight is a pretty nice feature.

Let me first say that I did not purchase this mini stepper through Amazon, but rather directly from the Discovery Channel Store. Two weeks after I submitted my review of their product on their web site, however, they still have not seen fit to post it.

I used the Discovery Electronic Mini Stepper daily for 29 days (30 minutes per day) before the cable around the pulley-wheel broke. This seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment, judging by previous reviews on the DCS (Discover Channel Store) web site. Being inside the 30 day return window, I sent my stepper back for a refund. Customer service, I must say, was excellent...only the product itself was cheap and substandard.

On a related note, this is the third mini stepper (various brands, not all DCS) I have owned in the past year. They have all broken down in one way or another. Feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details, but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper.

Take some advice from me when I say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness. That is to say, if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15-20 minutes, then you may be satisfied with one. However, if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine, then don't even consider one of these machines - you will destroy it, trust me. There's just too much that can go wrong -- pulleys cracking, pulley cables breaking, shocks leaking...and I actually broke the frame of one stepper. Through all of this, I have learned one important lesson about exercise: keep it simple. I am now having great success with some simple resistance bands (many varieties are available here at Amazon) and cardiovascular exercises (e.g. regular old jumping-jacks). I get a better workout than any I ever got from a mini stepper, and I'm feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places :-)

Honestly, if you want to save yourself some grief, please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction. Just buy yourself some resistance bands, maybe a jump rope, an exercise mat, an instructional video/book, and then get to work. Exercising to tone your body and lose weight isn't easy (and if it is, then you're probably not doing it right), but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this

For all of the supposed 'resistance' built into this machine, it enables you to do  many -more- repetitions than you'd be able to do  of simple bodyweight 'core' exercises,(crunches, leg lifts, situps, and a multitude of others). Why is that, and what is the effect? 1/ Why : The resistance is -less- than the resistance supplied by the weight of your own body being moved around without any equipment. The so-called 'resistance' actually -assists- you on the return motion, the exact opposite of exercise.2/The Effect: You must do an incredibly high number of repetitions do get any effect at all, and it won't be much even then. High rep work should be full-body cardio , not isolated ab work. Ab work should be the same as any other muscle-building work : After you can do 15 reps , the resistance should be raised: Exercising the abs, obliques, other core muscles  to strengthen and build them. If an exercise doesn't get difficult enough to make you stop after a minute or so, it simply isn't difficult enough to do you any good. There is no such thing as spot reducing exercise. Modern ads know better than to claim the lie of spot-reduction, but they still strongly imply it. Why do they get away with it? : Because people never stop looking for an easy way out. The re-sale value of these gizmos goes down to around 5 bucks as soon as you own it. Why? : Because the market is flooded with as-seen-on-tv, home-exercise junk that's collecting dust

I am waking up during the night reinflating this thing and after an hour it is back to being deflated.  Don't waste your money like I did

The Brunton Nexus Star is a low-cost, fairly rugged, basic compass.  Like any low-cost compass, if you know how to use it you can get where you want to go, but it lacks features you may later wish you had.  On the plus side, it is lightweight, inexpensive, and fairly thin, so it doesn't take up a lot of room in your pocket.  On the minus side, the baseplate is very short, so it is harder to use with a map and a little less accurate when reading a bearing.  The biggest disadvantage, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have a true declination adjustment; it is advertised as having a "declination scale" which is not the same.  On a baseplate compass, you take a bearing by lining up the compass needle inside the North Reference Indicator (sometimes called the "Doghouse") etched on the bottom of the vial.  Compasses with true declination adjustment allow you to rotate this "Doghouse" to align it with the desired declination.  That way you always read a bearing by aligning the needle inside the Doghouse.  On the Nexus Star, however, you can't do this.  Instead, you have to remember to line up the compass needle with the point on the scale that corresponds to the local declination.  In this case, the needle is not boxed inside the doghouse, and I find it can lead to errors, especially when you are tired and not thinking clearly after a long hike.  If you always navigate using magnetic bearings rather than true bearings, this isn't a problem.

I can recommend this compass for use with a GPS receiver that is set to read magnetic bearings, and it is suitable as a back-up compass.  I also regularly use it as an inexpensive tool to teach students in my GPS classes how to use a compass, but I wouldn't recommend it for serious work

I threw this away yesterday (3.30.7) First of all, it's too cheaply designed and manufactured to stop anything as heavy as a door. The tin plate on it fell off last week and no one even broke into my home. I went to my local hardware store and purchased a solid steel 'Collins Axe #4 (wood) Splitting Wedge' to replace it. I bought a tube of Hard As Nail Heavy Duty contruction Adhesive and affixed some rubber to one side of the wedge to prevent slippage. Now that's the way a door wedge should be! Don't waste your money on this cheap Chinese garbage called the 'Super Door Stop Alarm'! Make your own right here in the USA

This ball is radio controlled with a remote that is about the size of a small cell phone. The ball has two small holes (smaller than the size of a dimple) on opposite sides that connect to a battery operated charger (2 AA). The remote uses a 9V battery. The ball has a small internal battery that apparently can be replaced if needed once it can longer hold a charge. The ball can be operated for a couple of minutes after a charge. 

The ball is not meant to be hit, but probably can withstand a putter hit from a short distance. Because of a rolling weight and circuitry within the otherwise hollow ball, the ball does not roll straight on its own. The ball looks somewhat like a real ball but has a slightly off-white color and has an obvious seam. 

When using the remote to control the ball, the ball revs up for 2-3 seconds by making a rattling sound, then it takes off still rattling away. An arrow on the ball is present to let you know the initial direction the ball will roll. You can reverse the ball's direction, but you can't make it go left or right.

The two biggest drawbacks of this gag ball are:
1. You can only direct the ball in two directions (front - back) with the remote.
2. A fairly loud rattling noise is made by the ball that probably can be heard from about 20 yards away.

As a gag ball, it seems like it is of only limited use. But for about $10, what more can I expect

The 'blue' body ball that was sent to me was not blue. It's white with some blue print. The pump didn't work right so I used a rocket type pump that came with a ball I had purchased from another company. Plugs and pumps seem to be interchangeable. The quality of the 'blue' ball is good. When I opened the box it looked like the ball was the wrong size but it expands to the 65cm. My first thought was wrong color, wrong size. No inflation directions enclosed in box only an excercise chart. Ball is OK, pump is not. I was not happy but didn't want the return hassle. If you aren't fussy about color and have a back-up pump, go for it.

My Daughter is 38" and about 30lbs.  It's the perfect size for her.  We mainly use it as something to lay on while watching TV or reading books on the floor. 

PROS
- When in the "chair position", it's tall enough to accommodate taller children.
- Cover is removeable and washable
- Comes with handy pink storage bag (although it's kinda hard to fit the pump in the bag along with the bed)
- Pretty easy to convert into chair (there are 2 straps on each side of the bed that need to be "connected" in order to change it into chair - they are color coded).  Might be hard for young children to figure out how to do it.
- Inside of sleep bag is made of soft material (although it appears as though it may snag easily).
- Large zipper located on one side of the sleep bag.  Easy for small hands to use.
- Weight limit: 100 lbs


CONS
- The Pump is VERY cheaply made and it takes a long time to inflate the bed (it operates by use of foot motion or you can use your hands).
- The air slowly leaks out of the bed.  We actually thought ours had a hole in it when purchased, so we exchanged for another one.  But this one too deflates pretty quickly.  Example: if we completely inflate at 7pm, by 8am the next morning it needs to be inflated again because it loses about 40% of it's air.
- Adult help is needed to change into chair.
- Adult help is needed to inflate.

OVERALL: It's a bit pricey for the quality I was expecting.  It would be nice if adult assistance wasn't needed to change from bed to chair and back.  Defitely would work as an extra sleeping spot for the night, but it takes along time to inflate and requires an adult to do so

Bought it 2 months ago for in-door usage, thought it'd last until the end of the semester.
After less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage, punctures started to appear, and the patches that came along with the package didn't help much.
Even though the design and the built-in manual pump is a big plus, the quality is very disappointing

Just like once in a while even a blind squirrel finds a chestnut.....once in a while Amazon gets it right!  Had a very bad experience before Christmas when ordering a gift for my daughter.  After being scared into spending extra on next day shipping 2 weeks prior to Christmas....on an "IN STOCK" item,  5 days prior to Christmas, I was notified that item was OUT OF STOCK and I wouldn't receive it...PANIC MODE!  I sent an unsolicited E-Mail complaint to Amazon.  My response was pretty much  sorry, but Amazon has no control over items that they essentially broker, and don't actually inventory.....WHAT!      I noticed that they didn't ask for a review of my experience on that one!!   But my son did get his B-Ball this time....and if it wasn't for him, I would have never done business with Amazon again! This review probably doesn't meet the guidelines and undoubtedly won't be posted

 I just read an article at the Fox sports website saying it is almost certain that NBA will go back to using leather ball.
 There will not even be a bragging right once this officially happens, so in my opinion, don't buy it

Ok, i REALLY thought this ball would be GREAT considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the NBA.  NOT SO!  This ball feels very similar to the cheap $20 balls you can get at your local department stores!    Feels similar to the Wilson NCAA solution game ball, but slightly less tacky, but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber.  I personally do not like that.  This ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box, without a break in period.  Well, i hope it gets to feeling better over time, but since it supposedly has not break in period, i am very skeptical.  I honestly do not feel the "crosstraxxion" design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball.  If you like the feel of leather, this is NOT for you.  I am NOT impressed!  Search for reviews for this ball before purchasing!  The only thing you can do with this ball that you can't do with others, is say "Well at least this is the Official Game Ball the pros use!"

This bokken is only for looks and not hitting ant thing I used it for less than five mintues and broke. It has a nice look and feels good but does have blemishesand. Also say if you accidentally hit something even a little hard it breaks. The company does a lousey job of wrapping the sword too. The barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and I ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken. I spar with my friends all the time and would have to recommend the bokkens from karate depot instead of this inadequate piece of whatsit. Anyone,honestly, that tells you differently is wrong

I am in the same boat...stupid..I should have read the comments before bidding on ebay and getting ripped off first on price..I paid about $45 on ebay...and then it came stright from Amazon and NO DVD...I called cust service and all they could tell me is to send it back and get a refund...what a pain...I told them to use photo shop and crop out the picture of the dvd...false advertising...oh well live and learn...ball does seem pretty small once I aired it up...I think I will look else where for a differnt name brand ball.  And yes it takes like 30 min of pumping to get it blowed up and its a huge work out..arms hurt etc

I was also disappointed that the product came without a DVD, though the initial description said so. But Amazon has given me the refund of the whole purchase price. Appreciate their gesture. 

Agree with previous reviewer that the pump is really hard to work with. It took a *lot* of time to get the ball inflated and the pump got hot meanwhile.

Yeah, not very happy with this product.

p.s: Contrastingly, had a bad experience with Dell on a similar situation when I bought a Nikon camera. Dell blamed the wrong description on Nikon and expectedly, Nikon blamed Dell. Neither owned up the error. But Amazon was pretty good. I really appreciate it

...intentional rip off?

There is no 50 minute work out DVD included. The pump included does not work (after pumping air for 20 minutes straight doesn't even put a dent on the deflated ball) and becomes very hot after a while. I kept thinking the plastic pump is going to melt before the ball enflates (if ever). The "65cm" ball turns out to be only "55cm."

I don't know... seems like a rip off to me, but amazon is not at fault, since the Nautlius web site has the exact same description for the item.

Quality-wise, the TKO Cory Everson Fitness Ball 55cm I got a while back was so much better. The plastic isn't so sticky, and it felt a lot more durable than the Nautlius one, too

My son has had this pogo stick for about a year and has not been able to play on it because the spring is too stiff and does not compress easily.  Even my daughter who weighs 70 lbs cannot get it to work.  Our 11 year old neighbour who has her own pogo stick had no problems, but it is not for the beginner

I just received this toy today in the mail and it was a total bust.  I gave it to my 14 month old daughter and she handed it back to me.  They legs that are supposed to make the music are hard to push and she can not do it herself.  I only paid 5.29 for it with free shipping so I can't complain.  At least My 3 month old likes to look at it.  I would not recommend buying this toy

This poker set is the cheapest quality there is.  For the price, I kind of expected a lesser quality product but not this bad!  The chips are plastic with a metal insert.  The chip edge is sharp and there are a lot of imperfections on the chip like dirt was mixed in it.  Furthermore, the thickness of the chips are UNEVEN.  Therefore, when you stack the chips (depending on the color), 5 white chips may be shorter than 5 black chips.  The poker case handle broke the first time I lifted it.  The chip dividers are loose and the felt material is not glued in properly.  This is really a bad product which should be banned from Amazon.  

Save yourself some grief.  Spend a little more money and buy a reputable poker set!  What a waste of time and money

I bought this bike thinking since Jeep put its name on it then it should be a great, tough, rock solid ride! Boy was I wrong! Not only the bike feels cheap and extremely heavy, its mechanics are worst part. After taking it to a bike shop to get it tuned professionally, 10 of its gears still don't work. Now you may say well the mechanic did a quick crappy job, let me tell ya, I stood by the guy as he worked on it for 2 hours yet the gears still didn't work. Overall, I'd have to give this bike two thumbs down. You're better off buying a bike from walmart

I thought this would be the ultimate gym bag. The main compartment is too narrow. Your shoes will not fit side by side, you have to stack them. The pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough. The zippers are cheap and stick. It is very pretty but not very functional. My $16.00 bag works much better.

Field in a bag claims to be "the perfect way to get a baseball game going".  While this may be true, the number of games you can actually play with this set will be ONE (if the set even makes it through the game).
First off, with these bases you must set up the field using the wooden mallet the pound a flimsy plastic stake into the ground.  With one of my sets (I bought 3 unfortunatly at the same time not knowing their reputation), the wooden mallet wasn't even glued together, it had fallen apart so I had to just use the head.  Then when I put the stakes into the ground, out of the 3 sets I had, at least 1 in each set broke while I was placing them.
To actually place the bases, the set gives you a string device that helps you measure out the field.  This was handy except for the fact that it took me 10 min to untangle the mess and then when I went to second base realized the string was not long enough.  Granted, one could place 1st and 3rd and then figure out where 2nd went but the picture in the set-up shows that the string will measure the base; however, it definintely is not the right length.
After placing the bases the team is now ready to play.  However, don't wear cleats with these bases.  The bottom of the base says, not recommended for use with cleats and boy were they right!  With our game we had tball children using the bases and even their little cleats  (and not all the kids had cleats) tore them to shreds.
Our bases lasted about one hour before they were torn and the inside cotton coming out.  It was very unfortunate seeing as though we purchased three sets and all were done by the end of an hour.  This non-profit won't see that money again :)

So unless you plan on using these bases on the grass for easy set-up, do not plan on wearing cleats, and not playing a true game of baseball/softball....you would probably be better off buying the $8 flat bases for temporary use (and they can be left outside afterward too).

- Just not impressed, sorr

About average for the price, nothing particularly illuminating about this flashlight.  The wide beam is fairly faint, with a strong central spot.  This one will go out into the garage, and likely stay there.

Even though this is a receiver hitch mount item, it does not use a standard hitch pin.  It is a permanent attachment to the vehicle hitch (must be bolted into the hitch - to remove, must be unbolted).

This totally defeats the purpose of a receiver hitch - versatility: the ability to easily - without tools - change whatever is mounted in the hitch.

Bad Thule!  Bad

I bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping, since I tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet. I was in for a big disappointment.  For the price that I paid compare to the other yoga mats, I was very disappointed.  Lesson learned, find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on-line.

For those of you who sweats alot, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS MAT.

If you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat. Seemed to fill the room with it's funk.

Does not grip well. I bought it for grip.

Yes, it's stable. Worth it? Not to me.

Try the hugger mugger earth elements mat(5mm model). It's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat. Not as stable in place, but seems a better value(reasonable price). And it's biodegradable

Well, they looked so cool on TV that I ordered 2 of them and I regret it. It's awkward to get the hook back into the "rocket" once the bait is on. I took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod. We left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current. I've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money. If you're going to take a little one out fishing, just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat IDEA. [...]

My first pedometer from Sportline worked only a few days (digital display completely disappeared), so I returned it to them, and after over two months and several emails from me to them, they replaced it with this Sportline 350.  The first two days, it worked fine, although it seemed to count many more steps than it should have.  The third day, in the middle of the day it said approx. 3400 steps, later that afternoon it said 1300 steps, and by nighttime the display totally disappeared, and never came back.  I just sent the second one back, and am expecting that again it will take several weeks and multiple emails to get the situation resolved with their slow customer service.  Their products seem to be very poorly made, and I don't expect to purchase any more.... after reading the reviews, I have just purchased an Omron, and am hoping it will be much more reliable

The pedometer worked great for the first two weeks. Than my 1 1/2 year old snatched it off my jeans, it fell on the tile floor and broke the casing of it. It still worked, but I had to be careful when I opened it because the back was broken and no longer attached. Last w/e it stopped working completely. Everthing is set to 0 and won't move. My husbands odometer seems to be working fine. However, I'm dissapointed for the short life-span....

I thought this was great at first until I realized that it works sporadically. I can get up in the morning and walk all over the house, look down and check my Sportline to find it is still registered at 0 steps. Other times I can walk a mile or more and find it recorded maybe 20 steps. One of the problems with it is its shape. Unlike some pedometers (like Omron) that are a vertical oval-shape, the Sportline is a horizontal rectangle, which makes it easily roll with the waistline of your pants or skirt. It's important for a pedometer to be perpendicular to the ground for it to record accurately. After much frustration, I finally bought an Omron pedometer which I love. Unfortunately, this Sportline model is so inconsistent and inaccurate as to be useless.

I ordered 2 of these pedometers and neither of them count steps accurately.  One only counts about half the steps I take and the other is usually 2500 steps behind that.  I wore them both for a week and got the same results everyday.  I could understand if one didn't work properly but I got 2 at the same time with the same problem.  I would not recommend this product

This light worked for me when I used two D-batteries, but that was a lucky guess as the light did not come with instructions. I was also unaware that the light was fender mount, and wasn't happy about the idea of drilling a hole in my fender just for the light. I found that replacing the front  reflector with the light worked OK for me, and this replacement was easy on the cruiser I have. My main complaint for this product is the lack of description on the internet, and the missing installation instructions

I ordered two of these with high hopes, to be utterly disappointed.

First the design of the battery holders is bad. They are supposed to hold two C cell batteries. When I tried to get one in, I initially concluded that a different size must be requried, as it seemed the C size wouldn't fit. After much futzing around, I managed to get two C cells in without hopelessly bending the flimsy contact springs. This one now works but I doubt that I could successfully remove and replace the batteries again. The battery holder is too flimsy. On the second unit the contact wire which connects the two far ends of the batteries had fallen out of its plastic holder. After 15 minutes of trying to put it back I gave up. This unit is totally unusable. Nothing on the Pyramid package label indicates that two batteries, C cell size, are needed but not included.

Second this is a fender mount light, meaning if you want to mount it to your handlebar there's no way to do that with the hardware included. While the Pyramid box does say "Fender Mount," that description was not included in the online product description. And, this light with batteries installed is fairly heavy. The lightweight plastic fender on my front bike tire would not come close to supporting this light, and I doubt that many bike fenders these days would. Why would anyone sell this as a bike headlight without including a handlebar mount??

I'm totally disgusted with this flimsy product, and with the vendor who sold it to me

This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler. 

1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy 
2. Door Stop 
3. Play Street Hockey 
4. Stress Release Stomping Toy 
5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift 
6. Modern Art for Coffee Table 
7. Nerf Ball Target Practice 
8. Condom Dispenser 

Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun! 

PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at: Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it.

Two Amazon's statements about this product were absolutely misleading:

1. "Usually ships in 24 hours". It actually took 1 week to ship it.

2. When I finally received the package it turned out that the watch didn't have "leather band". The band was made of artificial materials (nylon and rubber) or something like that.

I will have to return it

i don't really write reviews, but i felt like i needed to say something about this one. maybe its me, but i couldn't get the pump to work. So i bought a new basketball. I bought a regular one, and bought a pump. I wish that infusion thing worked out, because it would have been great to deflate it, put it in my bag, and then pump it up again at the court. But my friend warned me they don't work so good. I'm just stubborn i guess. That's my 2 cents. Take it for what its worth

I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.

I was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good.  When it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2-4 people.   I kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch.  The Pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox

This nightmare was so disappointing! It was hard to assemble, and the instructions were minimal and illegible. It is an overpriced piece of junk. In addition, the net for the hoop was not in the box, and the hoop was put on backwards. My son was so upset. I would think this company would be able to produce a product that would be functional, with proper communication, and some info how to contact them if there was a problem, because there will definitely be a problem!

Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product

The plug that keeps the air in kept popping out.  We took it back and bought another one.  Same problem.  So we took it back again.  I think we spent more on gas going back and forth than we did on the float.  Buy one of better quality

When I purchased this item I got the impression that the kit (looking at the picture) included everything but the gazebo - which is the frame.
You should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit. I need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it. The title of this item should say: "gazebo screen" and not "gazebo screen KIT"...

We bought this tractor from Joe Brands.  It was a big disappointment!  It was very poor quality and did not function at all as was described on the Joe Brands site.  When I contacted Joe Brands and explained all the problems with this tractor they would not refund my money 100%.  They refused to pay the return shipping to send their dysfunctional item back to them.  They told me I had to pay the shipping and send it back to the manufacturer in Wisconsin instead of back to Joe Brands in Colorado.  I am in Las Vegas and it cost me a lot for shipping to Wisconsin instead of Colorado.  When I bought this item they sent it to me with free shipping.  After I shipped it back to them and they received it they disallowed my initial "free shipping" and deducted the original shipping cost from my refund.  I am out over $100 because of Joe Brands.  IF YOU BUY FROM JOE BRANDS YOU MAY BE SORRY!

I bought the armor abs because my gym membership just ended at my college.  So I wanted to get a few small workout machines for home.  The day i got it, one of the rubber bands popped of its holder already.  The machine is designed very poorly, although what can you expect for the price.  I've had to reattach the bands at least 15 times over the past week, and today one of the rubber band holders snapped in half, leaveing that resistance level useless :-( .  Overall though, i have to say, i really love this thing.  If it wasnt for the d*mn bands flyin off all the time, it would be a great peice of equipment.  If you use it carefully and correctly, you may be able to avoid these problems though.  I give it a two because i love the machine, but i hate its bad habits...

Does not work like advertised.  Ball falls way to low and right next to the pole way before you can hit it again.  It may also damage a wood or aluminum bat.  Last time I buy anything before reading the reviews on amazon.

I bought this for my 10 year old son's birthday.  He was very excited about it and having Derek Jeter endorse it was an added treat for him.  We spent half an hour setting it up and trying to figure out how to use it.  We eventually concluded that it was a BIG disappointment.  The ball comes around real slow and drops to the bottom of the pole.  I was worried he was going to hit the pole instead of the ball.  I can imagine how this might work for a power hitter like Jeter, but imagine a 10 year old!  Save your money, time, and child's feelings

This is the first product I've bought through Amazon that I wish I could give a negative star rating.  After involving three adults and spending about 3 hours troubleshooting, I've concluded this product **** DOES NOT *** work.  Customer service cites this is a "product upgrade".  A video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit.  What we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle.  It would barely even unwrap.  Imagine Derek Jeter in the photo trying to hit the ball three inches from the pole at 1.5 miles per hour and you can begin to understand this product upgrade.

This looks better on TV than it actually works.  The cable that the ball is connected to is very rigid and you have to really hit the ball hard to get it to wrap around.  When it unwinds it does so VERY slow and loses it's momentum and sinks to the pole before you even get a chance to hit it.  Plus they advise you not to use an aluminum or wood bat to hit it with?  What are you supposed to hit it with then?  These things you don't find out until you get it out of the box and set it up.  Don't waste money on this item

This bike should not have the name Mountain in it, you can not take this bike off ride.  It might be good for paved roads but you will hurt yourself if you try to use this bike even on the most basic of trails.

Do not buy this bike

I had purchased a rifle from Airslat and it broke after 3 minutes of use.  The quality was not good, but, the customer service of this company is the worst i have ever dealt with.  It has been 2 weeks and no replacement has been shipped.  i have had every excuse imaginable, first they wanted me to pay for shipping, then they wanted me to pay full price for another gun, then they said they did not have that model any longer and I would have to pay for the higher priced model.  i still have not been refunded or had the item replaced.  i have spent hours trying to get this taken care of with no progress.  the worst customer service of all time!

I used this product for surface level snorkeling and was extremely disappointed: 1) it filled up with water after only 15 minutes in the water and 2) the plastic holder came off of the clasp during snorkeling (luckly, I noticed it floating near me when I stoped to clear my mask).  Referring to this product as 'waterproof' is criminal as everything I placed in the holder was saturated with water; even after dumping it out and resealing throughout the day it continued to fill up with water.  In addition, this product is overpriced as a snorkeling mate found a truly waterproof holder at a dollar store that kept his contents perfectly dry throughout the day.

Purchased the 418 Elliptical 5 months ago now.  Reviews after a week or two may not tell the whole story.  After 3 weeks the clicks, squeaks and clunks wouldn't go away by just tighting bolts so I called for service.  It took 4 weeks to get a tech. to look at it, he had to order parts which took another 4 weeks.  Replaced one of the main flywheels inside and the track rollers under the pedals.  It's not as noisy now but still makes a clicking noise on every rotation and intermittent squeaks and clunks.  Thought by spending a little more on this machine than the cheaper competition these problems would have been avoided, not so.

The heat rate monitor is not accurate but the rest of the electronic features have been working fine, unlike many other reviewer's comments

This tent is alright. Its not very sturdy and they sent me the wrong parts. I bought it in the spring and this fall, with a little bit of wind its in pieces and in the garbage. I don't really think its worth the money. It is very spacious, just wish it was better made.

I was surprised when I received what appeared to be a sales brochure. I searched carefully through the shipping materials to see if I had missed the book entirely, but in fact the small, clumsily put together manual was in fact the $3.75 book that I bought online. It has some new exercises in it, but most of what we needed to know came with the therabands in the little manual that ships with them.

i dont have this ramp but my neighbor does. i have a homemade quaterpipe that is 4 feet in height and is about the same price in materials. the lauch ramp is really small and after awhile it gets pretty boring. im a skateboarder and usually go 2 da sk8prk which i find more fun then playing on a small lauch ramp. i dont think this ramp is worth the price at all. u can get ramp plans on websites for free and u can build a much better ramp for a cheeper price

This ramp set is really fun to skate on, but keep in mind that it takes a lot of damage. First it will begin to slide when you skate on it due to lost rubber bottoms. Screwing screws into the edges of the ramp can somewhat solve this problem. The worst thing that happens is when the front of the ramp begins to curl upward, making it so you have to constantly pull it back down. I forgot to do this one time and my skateboard wheels locked up and I went flying. But don't let this turn you away. It is a good fly box nonetheless, but just keep in mind that a homemade wooden one would last you a lifetime, not a year.

Have received and reviewed this item. I cranked it for 2 minutes. The radio played no longer than 2-3 minutes then died. I tried to crank it longer - same results. It is useless. It's large and bulky (though very sleek and nice). The cranking handle looks fragile and I suspect with all the cranking this toy needs, it will break sooner than later. Bottom line: Don't buy it. I own another similar product which has a simple look however the radio plays for at least one hour on a 1 - 2 minutes crank

This radio has a very good rich sound for such a small speaker.  The 1 bulb LED flashlight is brighter than I thought it would be.  The rubberized case is solid and durable.  Two minutes of cranking has consistently provided 45 minutes of play time at average volume.  There are 3 big drawbacks.  1. The tuning knob is very small and next to impossible to read.  2. The crank handle is the smallest I've seen and feels like it will break easily.  3. The worst feature is the on/off switch for the flashlight. It is a "push" round button mounted on the side that keeps turning itself on when you hold the radio or pick it up.  They should have used a "slide" switch and put it in a different area

I just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap. But there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate. What is it for, I can twist without it. Anyway, 10 mins after using the machine I got a severe knee injury. I didnt have an injury before using it but I got one now. I am going to have to get rid of it.

it was the best price around and when it finally showed up at my door i couldn't wait to put it together until it was harder than it looked. you should use more than one person to put it together maybe it was my fault but the net was not fast nor easy to set up, just like the box says it was a challenge. Extremely! I would not recommend this product for someone who has no time nor patience for an hour long set up process. I do recommend anything that folds up quick and pops up into position. But the extreme deal would be an actual 10x10x10 cage you could get online for less than 500$. You might have to spend the money but to not have to deal with the headaches over and over again putting this together is well worth it. find your self an area out side and build your real cage and enjoy it all year long. The nets are not worth the time nor the money, balls still fly up out of the net, you have to be really close and the fabric is just like a tent. with as much force as im hitting the balls with it wont be long till the material is damaged. Dont waste your money even if you do get it for 60 bucks. The wind will always win, once it catches sail it tumbles like sage grass. Get Bigger Better Deals with the real Cage

I received the net missing a pole which you obviously need to erect the net properly.  But I was particularly disappointed in the net and its ability to stop a golf ball.  It no more stopped a driven golf ball than drapped toilet paper! Unless you hit the nylon target, you have lost a ball!  I may as well hang the nylon target alone from a tree and the results will be the same if I miss the target

I got this net and set it up in February and been using it fairly regularly. I was hitting some balls tonight and noticed some tears in the netting much to my disappointment! 

Shouldn't a $100.00 golf net last longer than 3-4 months?

Completely unacceptable

I have seen some really dumb things in my 46 years but this flashlight is near the top of the list.  A flashlight whose power reserve lasts only 30 minutes after 15 hours spent charging.  Sad thing is after not much more than 3 minutes the flashlight is down to half brightness.  8 minutes after turning it on the light it gives out is useless such that you would do better turning this flashlight off allowing your eyes to adjust to the darkness at least you will see more than what you did with this lame light.  I have heard some wild stories but the reality of this flashlight has me thinking the people who made this monstrosity are quite totally and completely insane living in fantasy land.

This flashlight is what you buy when you just want a prop to take up space and look good because as a tool for illuminating space it is totally, utterly and profoundly useless.  Your Good Money invested in this flashlight instantly becomes money wasted with no hope of any meaningful return whatsoever.  Don't say we did not warn you!  This flashlight should have a sign on it that says I am awesomely pathetic buy at your own risk!

Small print on box: Charging the spotlight takes approximately 15 hours using the AC charger adapter, and approximately 12-20 hours using the 12V car adapter. The spotlight/lantern cannot be used while charging. A full charge will provide for approximately 30 minutes of power.

30 MINUTES after charging for 15 HOURS? What the heck is the point of this flashlight

Despite charging the flashlight for the required 15 hours, the light failed to shine for more than 5 minutes. Also during those lackluster minutes of operation, the emanating light seemed to be nowhere near the advertised 1 million candle power

Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product

We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!  

Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars.

Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.  

Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor

I ordered this bike for my granddaughters 4th birthday.  The first shipment arrived on schedule, but the box was total destroyed and without opening you could see that the bike was scratched and dented.  Delivery was refused and another bike was sent.  The 2nd bike arrived, with the box being in less than perfect condition, but delivery was accepted.  When my son started assembling the bike, he found that several of the parts had been assembled at the factory incorrectly and he could not assemble the bike.  The bike was returned for a credit and we went and purchased a similar bike locally.  We still have not received a credit for the return of the bike.  I am very disappointed and will not purchase from this vendor again

I bought this watch for work to time a 2 min procedure.  I found the 30 sec sweep hard to get used to.  I'm used to a 60 sec sweep. And the minute hand was difficult to read.  I really had to check to see if I was at 1.5 min or 2.5 min.

I only had this for about 2 days before the resistance band broke in 2 places.

I found the performance of these Michelin tires to be adequate.  There doesn't seem to be too much in the way of rolling resistance and they grip the road well.  The road seems to have eaten these tires up...I have less than 1,000 miles on it and the tires are full of holes--that may say something about the quality of roads out here in Hawaii.  I'm getting a flat every time I ride.  My next tire will be something a little sturdier

I did get a nice little buzz the first two days I took this product, and it does give you a boost when you take it right before you work out.  You can push yourself a bit further at the gym.  The gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product.  It wasn't so good or effective that the side effects were worth it.  I had no lasting weight loss when taking it, just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later.  I'd skip it

There is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw. The ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side; so the open knife is not away from the set of keys. This is the first swiss army knife I have ever come across with this flaw. So alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo!!

I am writing this as a review of Hippo clubs in general.  I purchased a simmilar set from Amazon a year ago because it was a $300 set or irons reduced to $100.  I was interested in the graphite shafts (all I have ever used is steel) and wanted a cheap set to travel with (I have had 2 different sets of clubs lost during travel).  

The first thing that I noticed with these clubs was my miss-hits rose dramatically.  The clubs looked nice enough, but their performance was less than par.  When I talked with my club pro, he said that the problem with buying graphite shafted clubs that are inexpensive like these Hippos is that the shafts are cheap not consistant.  Your average pro plays with graphite shafts that cost up to $80 each.  He also indicated to me that high handicappers tend to buy cheap clubs (which was a humbling fact that I had to swallow), and that high handicappers tend to play better with steel shafts.  

All of this being said, I chalked up my $100 mistake and began looking locally at all of the golf shops for high-quality pre-owned clubs.  After 2 weeks, I found a hardly used set of '04 Big Berthas for $359.  I talked the salesman down to $299 and walked out with the best set of clubs that I have ever hit.  I guess my point is that if you are looking at these clubs, you are either a new or relatively unskilled player-- like me.  If this is the case, take some time and search out high-quality pre-owned or used equipment that will make your learning curve my shorter.  Let the golfers that get new clubs every two years spend $600-$1000 for new sets.  Take advantage of their trade-ins.  That's my opinion anyway

I had to repurchase this product, because my first one broke, the hinge that they use to attach the battery door to is pathetic, seriously a design flaw. However, with some Epoxy glue and a different type of hinge you can modify the origional product to be something better. In this case you really get what you pay for... Its dirt cheap plastic and it breaks easily. I wouldnt recommend getting this unless you need something dirt cheap and only plan on using it a few times.

The only satisfaction I have gotten out of this product is this opportunity to vent.  If the price seems too cheap, it is.  Where to begin?  Instructions, pretty bad.  Hardware, missing, inconsistent, inadequate.  Design, deeply flawed.  Mounting, not on my standard mountain bike.  Manufacture, cheap, cheap, cheap.

What result culminated my frustrating evening retrofitting it just to see if it would work?  I'll spare you the suspense, it didn't.  Not a glimmer.

I bought a pair of these as a workout set for heavy bag use, and have been mostly disappointed with them for that purpose.

Pros: Easy on and off, even putting them on by yourself. Wrist straps are simple and hold well. Breathe surprisingly well for the design.

Cons: Even with hand wraps on, I found my right glove to fit too poorly to absorb punches well; the design makes it hard to form a proper fist without trying to grip the glove into a proper position to do so. The left I have no problem with for some reason, maybe just have a bad pair? The padding makes blows glance off of the bag to a degree that it made me feel like I was risking injury when using them for actual impact punches. Grips make my hands feel too open when punching, can't grip a tight fist... my hands would be bruised or very sore after even a modest workout with them

This product falls into the category of "not worth the cost of shipping" for me.  The bag is a basic black nylon bag that is adequate for holding a large yoga mat.  The bag was shipped in an envelope via USPS first class mail for $1.35.  SAMFE was the retailer that Amazon used for this transaction, so Free Super Saver Shipping was not available.  SAMFE charged $7.50 for shipping.  I generally stay away from retailers who charge shipping in order to boost their profits, hence the low-star rating for an otherwise adequate product

we bought 2 of these "things" they both literally fell apart within 2 weeks of receipt

the stitching, in various parts of the bag came undone, we ended up throwing them away.

i've been purchasing things on line since 1995, and this product was by far the WORST thing we've ever bought!!!

run away, run away

I bought my free-standing heavy bag at a local store and I was very excited to try my new product.  When I got home I was in for a shock.  There were at least sixteen screws, locks, and washers in a little bag.  In addition to that, there was about twelve additional pieces that needed to be put together.  All in all, it took me about two hours to put this puzzle together and eventhough it weighs about 275 pounds once it's filled with water, it does not take much to move it around when striking during a workout.  I need to keep readjusting the base back to its original position every three to four punches I throw on it.  For the amount of money that I paid, this bag should have been put together for me.  I will keep the bag and put it outside.  If somebody steals it, they will be doing me a favor.  Next time I will go with what I know and buy a wavemaster from Century, now that is an awesome product

I didn't read in the instructions that I was also buying a dancing partner.  This thing just *will not* stay still.  I tried putting it on carpet and on wood floors, but the water weight just isn't enough to keep it still.  Power punching causes the base to tip and then slam back to the floor making a terrible racket.  If I lived in an apartment, my neighbors would hate me.  

The water ends up around 200lbs (when full) and just doesn't do the trick.  I have been thinking of using sand which tops out around 320lbs, but not sure how easy it will be to get back out since the only opening is a small opening on top meant for water.

As for springiness, you can definitely wail on this thing and it can take it (by moving across the floor), but in my opinion it's TOO springy.  There is no comparison to hitting a hanging bag.  It definitely needs a tension adjustment.

I'd say this bag is probably better for practicing control.  I wouldn't suggest this for an apartment if you plan on power-hitting

     I won't mention about the quality of this product. But this standbag doesn't have enough weight to stand my punch. I filled this with water to the full, and when I throw a hook the front part goes up in the air and comes down. Am I supposed to fill this up with lead?
     
     I'm not bragging. I am below average young males' heights and weights, I don't work out, never had a boxing training, just sometimes visit the gym with sandbags and throw punches when I'm depressed.
     
     I can't believe those guys who wrote the reviews are so weak to be satisfied with this stuff. I'm returning this and get a real heavy bag, even if it will cost a lot

I've had this product about a month, purchased from a sporting goods store - at first all was well.  Unfortunately the bag became shakier and shakier as time progressed.  I had to reset the screws (as other reviews for this product have mentioned) - but one screw WOULD not come out.  It was stripped.  A week later, same problem.  I tend to hit the bag about 2 hours a day 3 times a week and 1 hour a day the rest of the week.  Apparently hitting it causes the screws to warp the holes of metal centerpiece which connects the stand & bag to the base.  This causes either:

a) screws to strip
b) the holes to enlarge and warp, meaning screws no longer catch.

Apparently whoever designed this product forgot that a punching bag is made to be struck and hit.

Today finally the bag got KO'ed because now only two holes in the metal centerpiece out of eight will actually securely catch the screws.  I'm a 6'1 220 lb. guy and I'm only using about half of my full force into my punches (again, I hit it just about every day) - so in other words this bag is definitely not intended for heavy-duty use.  I'll call Everlast Monday and keep my fingers crossed that the replacement part is made sturdier than the original

I bought this stroller because it looked nice and sturdy.  I liked the stroller with air-filled wheels and other features such as brake and wheel-locks.  However, this stroller is so cumbersome if you have a compact car.  Even with my Acura, I still have to take apart the front wheel to fit the stroller in the trunk.  Imagine you have your kid and have to assembly your stroller in a before your walk.  It's inconvenient and takes up lots of space in your car's trunk.  I was mislead by Amazon description of the stroller that it would fit in trunk of any car.  Yes it would fit but you have to take apart the front wheel to make it fit in.

I bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it, so I thought I might like the Alps chair too.  I was wrong. It's very light weight, but it's a lot longer than my other chairs, which made it more difficult to carry and transport.  The arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings, one of which broke the first time I used the chair.  The next day, three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points, throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless.  Save your money on this one

Got my Bowflex weeks ago and having trouble, lots of trouble putting it together. It's not the product's fault other than the fact that putting together is a real 'mutha. Seems the parts could've been marked better. Identification is pretty much visual. Instead, you have a "picture map" to compare what part is needed. I was doing fine until I inserted the wrong bolt, stripped the bolt trying to get it out, got the WD40 on it, finally had to use a crescent wrench. So, my confidence is blown and then I continued on to assemble the seat backwards. The assemblage directions could be better, believe me. I used the 800# once, but I finally found that no matter what was suggested, the picture was misleading and there's no way that could've been explained. Onward through the fog!

When I purchased a pair of these gloves a couple of years ago, I had high hopes.  My hands become cold easily, and I was looking forward to wearing gloves that would actively help in warming them.


I will admit that these gloves are respectable as normal, unheated gloves.  They are fairly well insulated and provide a moderate degree of dexterity.

However, the heating element is ineffective.  Inserting batteries into the gloves provided little (if any) increase in warmth.  My fingers remained cold.

In addition, I have recently discovered that the thin wire connecting the heating element to the battery in one of the gloves has become disconnected.  These gloves have not been subjected to any harsh abuse, so it is disappointing to find that the wire had been disconnected so easily.

If you are looking for a pair of heated gloves that will actually make a difference and keep your hands (including your fingers)warm, look elsewhere

I purchased this item based on the picture.  I didn't want a cheap looking air-hockey table because I planned to keep it for a long time.  The price seemed good for the looks of the table even though the shipping was $150.  Arranging delivery with the carrier was a bit awkward, but not too bad, but the box itself was clearly abused and showed a general lack of care in handling.  I don't know if the abuse was from the carrier delivering it to me or prior carrier, but it did have me worried about the condition of the contents.  I couldn't see any parts through the holes and tears in the box, so I hoped for the best.  When I opened the box, there was no obvious shipping damage, however there was one spot on the surface that could have been caused by improper packaging.

The assembly instructions were a poor quality photocopy that cut the top line off most pages.  There was a separate sheet of paper instructing me to line up letter tags during assembly, however, the tags were not properly placed and assembly per the diagram on the sheet would have been impossible.  Assuming all parts were symmetrical worked just as well.

I was also disappointed with the quality of the assembly of the main components.  Alignment was poor, making final assembly difficult, and there was excessive adhesive all over the place, even on the playing surface.  I was able to remove most of the adhesive from the playing surface except for one spot that may have been damage from shipping.  The table comes with a 90 warranty on materials and workmanship, but doesn't include shipping.  As the table surface is the largest component, I'm imagining it would cost most of the $150 shipping fee to have it replaced.  At this point, I'm not willing to sink any more money into this table.

After the table was set up, I was hoping it would at least play well.  I was disappointed there too.  There are some plastic guards on the goals that make scoring very difficult.  I've never seen anything like them on other tables.  By the time you get the puck moving fast enough to evade your opponents blocking of the small opening your shooting for, it fly's off the table.  In fact you spend more time retrieving the puck than you do playing.  Maybe this has something to do with the extra adhesive down the sides of the playing surface, but it still ruins the game.  There were a lot of excited kids when the table arrived.  They all played about one game and now the table sits unused.

All in all, this has been my most disappointing online purchase.  I guess there are some things you see first hand before you buy

I love the lenses but these goggles are painful to wear.  I tried various adjustments but they are still too uncomfortable.  I sent an email to Speedo  to let them know.

I ordered and received this item through The Golf Warehouse. It arrived and I immediately saw a defect,in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly, even with major force. I contacted the Golf Wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them. I requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me. Since then I have tried to contact David Leadbetter's organization but without any success. I am desperately unhappy about this purchase and, in particular, the after sales service.

I bought this toy for my 9 month old son for Christmas. He loved it and it is a wonderful toy. However, in mid January it started to sound as if the batteries were dying and then it just quit. I replaced the batteries but to my disappointment it still wouldn't work. I tried different batteries again just to be sure and still nothing. I had a very hard time finding out how to contact imaginarium.com and finally just emailed amazon. They responded quickly and it appears that I will be able to return the toy and my son liked it enough that I may take my chances and buy it again. There are mixed reviews some saying that it is durable and works great and a few like mine

Our kids loved this - so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on/off button (making the toy unusable), I bought another one.  Wouldn't you know the same thing happened a few weeks later?  This toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion...the manufacturer needs to correct this problem

My husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it. they were so disappointed:( this has now happened twice!!!!! fyi, the first one we inflated and it deflated within days (slow leak). what a waste! it is so heavy that it would cost $20 to mail it back for a replacement. don't bother.

For the price, I shouldn't complain, but what the heck?  What ever happened to quality control?  It came double shrink wrapped.  There was a plastic handle guard that didn't fit the sword, so I had to just throw it away.  Very little pride in the product.  The wood was roughly sanded before it was painted.  Well, it's just a stick afterall.  I'm just glad I did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor, DreamObjects.  Read their feedback responses -- sounds a lot like aggressive Ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback.  Sorry -- waste of my time and a few dollars.  I gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you can't tell quality from a single digital photo

I purchased this rack a few months ago and it is very neat. Problem is that it does tend to move when you put the MTX bag on. The movement becomes more of a problem as the weight of the bag increases. Another problem was getting enough clearance between the rack and the tire if you are short like me and don't have the seat raised up really far. If you play around enough you can get it to work, but if you decide to put on the Topek rear fender (which I did)you may have to adjust your seat a little higher than might be comfortable. I just got accustomed to having the seat a little higher. Bottom line is that Topek has made a very neat system that just needs a few more refinements (and some better instructions) to make it perfect.

These seats, while they are as nice as they look, do not fit into a "seat" at the stadium, rendering them USELESS!  They take up 1.25 seats per, and if you are at a sold out game you will not be able to use them, especially if you have 2.  They need to make them a few inches smaller

Due to lack of space, and in need of activity I have decided to buy a mini stepped to increase my daily phsycial activity. This one I bought from a retail market and the reason for me to choose particularly this one was the price (of course), the flexbands with counter.

Very limited documentation, it doesn't tell you actually how you can adjust the difficulty levet, I figured out a better way after two weeks by experimenting the device. 

And then it sarted to make craking noises. So I used some olive oil on the joints that passed. Then The suspensions got air inside and at the very begging of the step it started to make a crack noise which I couldn't evade at all.

While experirmenting the device, the electronic part got loose, it was attached with a soo thin cable, one touch and the cable was torn off. OK I said that was my fault, I shouldn't have touched it.

But...

Today, the `steel` cable that holds the pedals got apart. That is so suprizing, I am only 80 kg, and using it usually every two days for 30 minutes... Very bad construction.

Ok... Why I gave 2 stars? The flexicables worked really well. 
That deserves a point.

I bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking.
But after I say 2-3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars, at a critical point. I did carry a heavy backpack in the basket. But still I think the basket is a piece of junk.

Plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork, which limits your height of your handlebars. The basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable. 

I can't recommend this basket.
Buy a basket from your local sports authority or something.

thanks

The snap on the Leapers "Elite" Drop Leg Holster (the term Elite must be used loosely) would never stay attached. It would always either unsnap or come loose at the back. Eventually it fell off in the field and I lost it. The straps would never stay securely in the place I positioned them. 

The Leapers Deluxe Drop Leg Holster is much more effective. Even w/ one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place. The method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well. Spend a few more dollars for the Deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the Elite

This was the 2nd DVD with problems that I bought from this vendor.  The first DVD had 2 sections where the DVD would pause but would continue playing, and I was willing to live with it.  Bootcamp/Muscle Endurance, on the other hand, would not play the Muscle Endurance workout at all!  I contacted the vendor and they said it was a problem with my DVD player and they would only allow me to exchange with any of their 'OPEN' dvds only to 'better suite my needs'.  I own 20+ workout DVDs and none of them gave me any problems like this one did.  The DVD is also fairly pricey and so I'm afraid to buy any more of these dvds from them.  I was able to play the Bootcamp workout until towards the end (before the cool down section) where it would not continue playing.  I like Cathe's workout very much.  The part of Bootcamp that I was able to play was excellent! But I am very disappointed with this vendor

Well I purchased this bike because I previously had a Schwinn recumbent bike that I was pretty happy with but had to sell it because I moved. I'm very disappointed with this upright bike though. I think the seat is very very uncomfortable, so uncomfortable that I don't want to use the product. The seat design in itself it horrible. The way it bolts on is a little strange, and it appears all the Schwinn upright models are like this. Even though I have the seat bolted down all the way, it still wiggles. As others have mentioned, my box came trashed all ripped and with holes in it. In fact, the UPS driver actually told me that I might want to refuse the product, but I took it anyways. I think I'm going to attempt to return this if possible. Although the entire process is a huge hassle since I work everyday, the box is trashed, and how heavy the product is. I also had to help the UPS driver carry it up to my 3rd floor apt. I don't recommend any Schwinn upright bikes, although I likes their recumbent series. I hope Amazon will help me come up with a solution to return this

I purchased a new 26" Men's Huffy Cranbrook Cruiser Bike. After assembly, to my surprise the rear wheel would not inflate because of a bad inner tube.

So what do you do, disassemble and return? No, call Huffy and they take you through nine hoops.  Finally they sent me the right part which took ten days, and I took the bike to a local fix it shop which charged me $15 labor to fix the rear wheel.

No savings!

P.S. The bike is a piece of junk made in China.  The instruction manual is nearly useless

This step sucks.  If you are used to doing step classes at the gym, you will find it difficult to switch to this smaller step.  I didn't know it was a smaller step or I wouldn't have bought it.  It is hard to adjust to the shorter step, especially when doing a turn step or V step.  It ends up being VERY close to a basic step.  I was so nervous about stepping too close to the end and flipping the whole step up, that I was cheating myself out of a full workout.  DO NOT buy this, if you're used to the step at the club.  I feel like it's more dangerous on this, and ended up doing a lot of the steps on the floor.  If you already know that you like to step, buck up and buy the club size step, even though it is twice the price of this one.  Otherwise, don't buy anything

The way these bags are constructed - or supposed to be - is that they are stuffed with fibers, and filled with sand, for weight, AT THE BOTTOM -  the part you DON'T punch.

I was wondering why it felt like I was punching a brick wall on the left side: that's where they stuck the bags of sand. Just what a fighter needs before a fight (or anyone needs at any time of their life) - to be punching compacted bags of crushed rock.

This is a clear defect: I am considering returning it. Not sure if they're all like this, but I assume mine is not unique. Can't find where it says it was manufactured, but in this day and age, and based on the "craftsmanship", it's reasonable to assume China. Hey - at least the cardboard box it came in was made in Missouri!

Mine also suffered a little damage during shipping: the box had a small hole in it and the bag got scuffed. It usually takes years of pounding before this type of damage occurs on it's own.

Hey, it's hit or miss when you order online, particularly with oversized items, as far as shipping an "handling" are concerned. The shipping box was damaged and oil stained, the product poorly constructed. So, I'd call this a "miss"

I bought both the Ark III and the Super Ark.  The Super Ark is a slight improvement over the Ark III but I would never recommend people buy either one.  There are far better entry-level kits, for just a few dollars more, available from other sources.  

The Ark III contains 24 oz. of water, a food bar, and a small, inexpensive emergency blanket in a Kleenex-sized cardboard box.  I'll use the products in the two kits to supplement the emergency kits I subsequently purchased.

I'm surprised - and disappointed - Amazon carries these products

Tent leaks in multiple places; including door seam, back panel, and through seams on Rainfly!  This is NOT normal condensation (I promise), but leaks that resulted in two bath towels and one sleeping bag getting soaked.  The tent was set up according to instructions with Rainfly secure and failed to keep its occupants (2 adults and a three year old) dry during a rain. Made for a miserable experience.

This gun is a piece of $#!&
My bro got it some time ago. He was so excited. It made me glad to see that he was so gung ho about his new airsoft. 

He loaded it, aimed at a 1-foot target not more than 20 feet away, sprayed as accurately as possible, and guess what happened...?

Yup, out of the 20 in the clip, about 5 or 6 hit. Not on the bull's eye, I can tell you that. The 20 shots went wayyyyyyy too fast for comfort, and the accuracy sucked like mad, but my brother's hopes were not dashed yet. (-_-)

He filled up the 110-shot mag, winded it up, aimed, and the same thing resulted, only this time, the spray lasted longer than 3.5 seconds.

OUT OF MAYBE 50 SHOTS FIRED, ABOUT 12 HIT. I checked the gun all around, but it was not defective at all, except for the part that this gun was made very cheaply.

My brother tried it on semi-auto, which is usually more accurate. Not for this gun, though. In fact, the semi-auto was even less accurate than the automatic feature!!! OUT OF 10 SHOTS, ONE OR TWO HIT! i COULDN'T TELL BECAUSE THIS GUN'S 140 FPS MADE BARELY A SOUND WHEN IT HIT THE TARGET! (We were shooting in the dark.)

Let's not even talk about the "red dot scope," or the "silencer."

I only gave it a two because (1) That is the next lowest you can give, and (2) This gun's looks is okay. Please buy a different gun off ebay or something!!! You can get an m16 with a grenade launcher with 300 fps and 300 mag cap for less than 20 bucks (if you bid correctly)!

By the time my brother had finished playing, his dopamine levels were probably under normal. In simple terms, he was disappointed

       I recieved this gun about a week ago and couldn't wait for it to arrive. It managed to arrive one day early because I live close to it's store in California. When I recieved it I couldn't figure out why I could not mount the scope. It was broken. Next I tried to read the instructions which are total crap because they are awfully written. I started to shoot it and every time I wanted to use the larger clip I had to jam it into the socket every time it stopped shooting, which was quite often.

               Next I had my sister shoot me with it from about 10 feet away and didn't even feel it when the BB's hit in a T-shirt. Plus, aftera while of shooting the semi-automatic started to fail and it would only shoot automatic. Lastly, in it's first CQB the strap fell completely off. 

Here are the main good's and bad's of this gun.
Good:
-relatively cheap
-lays down a lot of BB's in a short amount of time.
-collapsable stock is nice.
-relativly accuracte at close range

Bad:
-Clips either tiny or worthless because it won't stay in the gun.
-extremely weak
-accesories may come broken.
-insructions awful.
-low battery life.
-fire settings jam/don't work 

P.S I'm not really Jacqueline K. Schmidt

Good points of the EL-300: Powerful sharp beam; LONG run per battery change; easy on-off quick-mount clamp for anti-theft; and, it's a superb FLASHLIGHT. I like to use it for undersink and underhood repairs, so I often borrow it from my bike. This light is intense enough to force a person to avert eyes, if the beam hits direct from even, say 40 away. Cateye does caution us not to play the beam on people's eyes. In my estimate, it is mostly a terrific flashlight, and not a great bike-mounted headlight, at least as a stand-alone.

Trouble is, that sharp-focused narrow beam makes you choose between two conflicting and shifting essentials: lighting your path (you actually CAN with this focused power); or alerting others to your presence. That would mean focusing it more toward oncoming traffic, or a tad right or left, toward peripheral traffic, depending where you are, and how the road tracks, and where cars are coming from. It's a real attention-getter to oncoming drivers, which is great, if conditions are all just right: IF you focus the lamp near level, and if the drivers are considerate enough to all approach from in front of your beam. 

However, traffic off to the side is another deal, since the headlight's peripheral light suffers by contrast. I nearly took a short trip to a long rest, as a result. Late on a quiet night, one flaky guy entering a major, broad secondary road I was traveling was coming fast up to his stop-sign, on a side street to my right, ahead of where I had just rounded a curve. He had a view accross broad lawns, on up the dark road behind me.

After slowing just a bit, he accelerated and ran his stop sign. I was right near his position on his side-street, "committed," pedaling about 15 - 17 MPH, about to cross his bow. He started his right turn, gunning it, merging with unseen ME. He was totally UNAWARE OF ME, and was clearly of this mindset: 
         "No double-CAR-headlights,
          no CAR noise,
          so no CAR, 
          so nuttin' coming, 
          so, good-to-go, so -- GUN IT!" ... all in the space of a couple seconds.

Moving fast, with the right-of-way, I had the EL-300 blazing away bright. Only, it was focused straight ahead of me, and a tad downward toward the road surface yards in front. I was dependent on the EL-300, to send ahead to the likes of him, unavoidable announcing LIGHT. It's what I paid for (about $45.00 delivered). I also wore a white helmet, had reflective stripes on my panniers and rack trunk, and the churning reflectors on wheels and pedals. But I know darn well all the reflectors in the world have no merit, when not bathed by headlights, and if not also bouncing back at a narrow angle to the driver's eyes. That's why I own a headlight. It's why now-enlightened NJ demands a bike headlight.

Of course, neither does a DRIVER have any merit, when s/he rewrites the stopsign law to read "No need to stop as long as I don't SEE ANYONE COMING." He nearly killed me, coming fast at me, broadside. He had regained nearly 15 or more mph as he started his right turn, still accelerating, when he spotted me and panic-braked. We were at one point about 2 feet apart, thanks to his hard braking, and my veering left on the (luckily deserted) dark main road. 

I was, for a fraction of a second, looking DOWN at his headlights and bumper almost below me. Could have reached over and touched his hood ornament. Incredible experience. It was my closest call ever, and scared the hell out of me. It must've scared the hell out of him, too. He registered his shock-and-awe with a reproaching after-fact horn blast, as he scrambled around and passed me, racing off before I could read his plate.

I guess it must've ticked him off, my scaring HIM with that close call. One little vehicular manslaughter can change your address awhile. Equally maddening for him, after he passed the intruding cyclist with the red blinkie taillight, and the white helmet, and all the reflectors (THOSE alerted him, once I was his front-and-center target), he would had to then see that blazing headlight's pencil-beam in his rear-view mirror. Damn, nuttin' he could blame on this creep on the bike. :-[

The EL-300 simply failed me that time, as I see it, by focusing most of its light in a narrow, long-projecting beam. It was focused left of where he was looking, when I was very close to the side street he was traveling, ignoring his stop-sign. There should, from so much light energy, be some part diverted wider, closer to the bike, even if lower intensity.

In my judgement there are two related design flaws with this lamp:
1. The narrow focused beam, making you "live(??) with" the single direction in which you aim the beam. Its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost in any ambient light. 
2. That is in turn aggravated by its wandering from the aiming you settle on, both vertically and horizontally. The vertical part is the worse; the mounting clamp sets too far back from the headlight's balance-point, so it's a seesaw that's forward-heavy. Lift your bike front, tap it down lightly, and you've likely refocused the lamp lower, as you would not if the mounting were at the balance-point. Aim it temporarily right (and tight), and you are seemingly good to go ... but only as far as the first noticeable bump. It then drops a few degrees, and you keep correcting it vertically, to light EITHER your intended path, or the oncoming drivers' windshields. Your need is like being at the Oscars: you want to both see, and BE SEEN, only in this case to save your life.

I am chasing after another LED lamp now, which I understand to have a wider (along with brighter) beam. I have respect for Cateye in general. Their current website page of battery-op headlamps does not offer the EL-300.

I ordered 2 of these flimsy tables.  They were not only expensive to ship, but one arrived damaged.  The one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully, meaning that people's drinks would slide off the table.  These are the most flimsy tables I have ever encountered. If it weren't for the replacement tables I found at costco, the party I planned would have been a disaster.

I really wanted to like this lantern. It is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price, but the light output is pathetic. The package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it, but I find that doubtful. The light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob Princeton Tec or Photon. In fact, I think you could read a map, or a book, play cards, or follow a trail, more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights. I'm returning mine.

I purchased this product from Performance bike to replace a much older (10yr) CatEye wired computer. I have a certain amount of brand loyalty to CatEye because their products are typically of higher quality (almost always manufactured in Japan as opposed to China) and typically last a long time, like the aforementioned 10-year-old cycle-computer. I purchased this product without much hesitation, but was disappointed with the unusually stripped feature set. The CatEye Vectra is missing two critical functions: ride timing, and average speed: features even my 10-year-old Velo2 computer has. It offers only current speed, max, odometer, clock, and trip distance. The overall quality of the unit is good, and I'm sure it will last for years with the solid Japanese construction, but I'll seek another unit because the missing features make it unusable for my purposes. Luckily, the sender unit magnetic pickup is reverse and cross compatible with CatEye's other wireless computers, i.e. it works with my older CatEye Cordless 2 computer also. 

Bottom Line: Pick another CatEye model and watch the feature set carefully

Made of a soft steel, the legs' attachment is a bit flimsy, so it leans forward too much. 
May not accommodate bikes with disk brakes (the upper hook is too low for the wide frame opening). I had to drill a hole and move the hook closer to the top of the stand to make it hold my 26" mountain bike

I'm in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official NFL football from a previous year and I wanted to get another one for backup. I know 'The Duke' is supposed to be the official NFL ball from this year, but there seems to be something wrong with the balls Amazon is shipping. 

The first ball I got from Amazon was hard as a rock, slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces. I got a second one and the stitching was a bit better, but it was still hard and slippery. And when it was exposed to rain, the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring. I have no clue if that's to be expected or not since it's all leather but it seems odd.  

In any case, you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves, which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball. So, it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe I play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands (which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls). 

Maybe the footballs just need to be broken in, but I'm not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them, which no one seems to want to do. I've tried to let some air out to make the things more user-friendly, but it doesn't really help. 

Anyway, I find it really hard to believe this is the ball the NFL played with this year. Something about them just seems cheaply made. In any case, I suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball.

I have been looking for nice Ti set for camping, and finally found it in Amazon at very cheap price! The Ti set is really light and good for backpackers. Unfortunately, I found one my of set (I bought 2 sets) got manufacturing defects, the fork is bent at a smaller angle, which looks quite weird when I stack them together. 
Hope Brunton should do better QA on their products.
Apart from this, the Ti set is quite nice! But buy with your own risk (you never know the angle problem if you buy 1 set only!)

While this rack looks good, and appears well constructed, it's mounting system leaves something to be desired. While attempting to lock this unit down tight enough to keep it from constantly twisting around, I managed to bend the locking lever. Now don't get me wrong, this is mounted on my wife's bike (a cruiser) and has had at most 10 lbs of groceries in the handy basket you can purchase that slides right on. But having to stop every so often to straighten this thing out is quite annoying. I suppose I will end up modifying the locking mechanism to avoid further aggravation. By the way, I have a Delta rear rack on my ATB that mounts to the seat post using a 4 bolt clamp. Much sturdier, and it was much less expensive, as well

i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift. at first he was thrilled to get a new one. upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it, he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain, making it almost impossible (and very uncomfortable) to use. He had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way. He did, however, like the other features, namely the light and the pen.

This item was sent back the sleeping bag was not sent and was on the invoice.  I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY REFUND CHECK.  This is the first time I have had any problems with items sent on Amazon.  I like Amazon because I can send a personal check and not a credit card.  Please send me my refund.

Very lightweight, fragile, and poorly finished. Not sure what the "hardwood" actually is. It looks oak-like, but is far too lightweight for it's size. It came a bit rough and splintery and only got worse over time. The lacquer or whatever it is that they finished it with developed spiderweb cracks almost immediately and then began to flake off. I only used it for kata; didn't feel safe actually hitting anything with it let alone using it to defend against a weapon for tandem drills. After a few months of very little use, mostly sitting on the rack, it began to develop cracks. Perhaps it wasn't dried properly when they applied the finish? Regardless, the one I received (50" model) was cheap junk. You get what you pay for... Not only not recommended, but downright dangerous if you hit anything with it. Spend a little more to get better quality

Well, i got through about a clip and a half before it started breaking.  First it went from semi-auto to uncontrolled auto, then it just stopped working.  It was pretty cool for a bit, and is pretty light and easy to set up, but I'd suggest looking somewhere else for a pistol

Wow I thought THULE was THE company for this type of stuff.  Boy was I mad after a trip from NJ to SC.  The bag was mounted to my roofrack and was a little noisy (top be expected).  But when I got to SC and opened the bag....the horror!  The inside lining shredded and flaked off on everything!   There were also 2 holes along the to seam!  What a mess...and I couldn't use the bag on the way home....had to ship my stuff home!  I just wrote THULE....we'll see if they come thru for the customer 
Sept. 12, 2005 THULE sent me a replacement, an Escape 2.  Great customer service....but does this mean the Escape is better?  Is the Quest inferior?  There was no coorespondence with the repalcement...I'll try it out this summer

I bought this to replace a C-Strobe light I used as a tail-light on my bicycle.  The C-Strobe was bright, flashed bright enough to make car drivers complain, and waterproof, just not rugged enough to survive being run over by a truck when it fell off my backpack.  This one was by the same manufacturer with "strobe action" and 1/3 the cost.

It doesn't flash, the "strobe action" is the way it appears to flash as you go in and out of the side ring of light.  It isn't anywhere near as bright as the C-Strobe.  I'm going to get a C-Strobe later this month from a local boating dealer

I was very disappointed with the Ironman Speed Jump Rope. It is made of cheap plastic and, even after a month of hanging from my 2nd floor banister with a weight on the end, it's still coiled and kinked. It's impossible to jump with it as you never know when one of the kinks will bump the bottom of your foot. I would not buy it again, even for the low price charged by Amazon

This Bobber Cooler is definitely a conversation piece.  I have had so many comments about it. I used it when floating down a small river near home (No Rapids, just calm water), it doesn't hold its weight, literally. The first thing is that the opening is in the center of the cooler, making it impossible to get drinks out with out pulling the whole cooler out of the water.  The opening seam rides just barely about the water, and since it is round the weight shifts a little and the seam will dip into the water. The cooler then fills up with water, which almost immediatly melts the ice, and as it fills up it will sink to the bottom.  maybe if there was a rubber gasket to seal it better, it might be ok.  The 2 plastic clasps on each side used to close the cooler are really easy to break off, plus they are facing the wrong direction. If you bump something like a rock or a log, it will push the clasp back and then unlatch the cooler.

This cooler might be good to use in bodys of water that do not have current, like a pool, but I don't suggest towing it behind anything.  I suggest using one of the many inflateble coolers on the market

 The only way other people can thnk it is a good gun is because when they first get it they look and say, cool. well it cant even shoot, so its not cool. this isnt just mine either its all of them cause it cant shoot because its made by the cheapest plastic, and i looked inside its only held together by the outside. the laser is off target (and sucks)and it shots as fast as u can throw it, if it shoots. I had this for about ten minutes before i thought that i got 13 dollars ript off. it fell apart after 1 hour. it couldnt shoot after 5 minutes.Dont get this gun cause it isnt just mine its the way its made. those othe reviews are people who probly dont ever use it and probly never have used it

It is NOT worth the money. It broke the first day I got it and with the silencer and all that crap it doesn't shoot. The BBs fall out the front. It jammed like 6 times before it broke. This gun is somewhat accurate but doesnt hurt at all. It sucks a lot. Don't buy any products from HotImport Toys, they are cheap, worthless, and extremely breakable

I never write reviews, but I had to make my comments on these socks. I bought them to keep my feet warm at me desk at work.  I put them on and turned the switch to high.  They DO NOT EVEN GET WARM at all...I thought it was broken, but realized it was both socks that didn't get warm. These are a total rip off and I am going to try and send them back.

If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.

As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else

Used once. Unit Blew a fuse. No manufacturer supplied info on fuse and none on the fuse body. No contact information was provided by manufacturer or seller. Had to calculate fuse rating.
Unit is very slow to make coffee.
Power plug does not fit well in 12V accessory recepticles. Does not go deep enough into recepticle to hold itself in place, has a tendency to pop out of the recepticle.
No return information provded.
Considering all the problems, I would not buy another product from this manufacturer, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Unit is overpriced

I'm sure the mat would have been fine, but they mixed up my order, and this company does not refund shipping, which was almost the price of the mat-- lame

When I first got the bike, I thought it was great. By 2nd ride the chain broke while I was trying to do a simple down shift. Unfortunately it also took out the shimano shifter mechanism which equates to big bucks in repair cost. Looking at the metal used it is no wonder it didn't last. Very poor quality. Too bad, because it is a great looking bike. I guess I'll give Wal Mart a try next.........

Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable

What this is is a cheap skateboard, with a cheap metal bar stuck through it, with some Dora stuff pasted on last minute.

Within the first day of using this, the Dora sticky-paper they put on the bottom of the skateboard (where your child puts their feet) was torn.  Within two days, it was nearly completely destroyed.   I tried to fix this with elmer's glue, but to no avail.

Now I have a 'plain' scooter...

I've seen this thing on sale for less than a ten-spot, it MIGHT be worth that price, but not any more..

Nothing against these particular paddles, but avoid cheap paddles. If you splurge on any item in your kayak budget it should be the paddles. If you paddle, you will develop a close relationship with your paddles - it can either be a good one or a bad one. You can markedly improve your paddling experience with a relatively small increase in spending. Good paddles will make you want to use your kayak

This piece is really quite over-priced for what you get, though not having the knife allows you to bring this on a plane with you.  I've seen this unit marketed elsewhere as a "travel-friendly" Swiss Army tool (not knife).

Nevertheless, the unit I have is the 64MB version of:
ASIN: B0002VM8ZM
...which costs considerably less (~$30) on Amazon, has the same 128MB USB drive and red light as the unit on this page, plus you get a small quantity of Swiss Army tools INCLUDING a knife.  Unless you are concerned about going on a plane, I'd recommend the ASIN: B0002VM8ZM over the unit on this page.  BTW, I got my handy little 64MB unit (which I'd give four stars for if I had the option) for only $9.99 on clearance at Target.

Maybe I should read the description better, but I was disapointed to find out, when receiving it, that this is JUST a USB Key with a pen and anemic led light.

No "swiss army stuff". Not even a knife. I thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have, you know, a knife? 

That said, the USB key is very tiny, almost too small on its own (detached from the swiss army non-knife housing), so it's good it has a "home" within the casing, otherwise it would probably go missing

I live in northern California, so rain is nothing new to me.  I've been putting off getting a large umbrella for quite some time now, but since I signed up for free Amazon Prime, I figure I'd buy everything I've been wanting for 30 straight days.  This umbrella made my list because I've read some decent reviews on it, plus it's affordable but I guess you get what you pay for.  The first umbrella came and the tip was split.  I ask for a replacement from Amazon which arrived next day (nice service) however, I wish this umbrella is as good as Amazon's service, because the replacement umbrella also arrived damaged.  Except this one is far worse; the entire tip is missing.  Since this is the replacement, Amazon will only do a refund.  By the way I'm STILL without an umbrella

I've been looking for weight lifting gloves, and trying out gloves that seemed to work for me but either bled onto my hands or ripped.  These gloves, however, dried out my hands and made me use lots of moisturizers.  They also tore down the knuckles on my left hand and in between the thumbs.  Weighlifting gloves are yes supposed to keep your hands dry during work outs and to prevent calases.  These gloves dried out my hands completely and gave me calases.  If you want a good pair of gloves do not get these

It may say "Slow Cooker" on the front of the item, but I assure you, it is anything but slow! I was looking for a crock pot for camping using propane and was told this was the item for me! 

So, I made my Hungarian Ghoulash in it, glad that the night meal would be done in 8-10 hours when we got back from the beach. All I can say is, thank goodness my husband noticed that it was bubbling inside of the cooker a half hour later, or we wouldn't have had anything but charcoal left, had we left the campsite that day without checking it! It was cooking on low, and it was literally done in a half hour's time. So, keep in mind, if you are camping and you haven't tried using this product yet, it won't take long before your meal is done. 

Sadly, my crock pot recipes were put away for the rest of that trip- the campground we were at didn't have electricity, hence why I wanted a propane crock pot.

This is the second Nike watch I ordered. The first one did not work and Isent it back to Amazon. Amazon was great and sent me new one. This one worked for a few days. I then had the battery replaced . Two weeks after it stopped working. By that time I had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen. I have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain. I am am glad I have had this opportunity to vent.
In short, the watch is awful.

After ridding a only a couple of times this bike began to fall apart. The brakes were faulty to begin with which were repaired soon after purchase. While ridding on an easy trail the seat broke off half way through the ride. With out a seat I had to walk the bike back to the car. I advise extra caution for first time bikers and do a check to make sure all the components are working.

I have an original thighmaster I purchased years ago...thinking this Thighmaster Gold was going to be similar I purchased it to take to work with me.  It is very flimsy-it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up. My old thighmaster is very sturdy-I have been using it for years and it looks fairly new.  This one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year.  Save your money

First of all I'd like to say how much I loved my Thighmaster.  I got one four months ago from a Sportmart and it has been part of my daily routine ever since. I have much better thigh muscles and a lot more confidence in myself because that little invention made of foam and an industrial strength coil. With that said, I have a slightly amusing and mildly alarming anecdote for you.
I was just beginning my strength training exercises and I had just done my second rep with the Thighmaster and all of the sudden I heard a loud pop and it fell to the ground . . . IN TWO PIECES! Now there are two things that immediately crossed my mind, "Wow man, my thighs must made of STEEL!"  and the other more likely scenario "Wow man, it fell apart after four months, this must be an inferior product."  Anyway I e-mailed SuzanneSommers.com in hopes that it was a fluke and that I had gotten the one crumby thighmaster.  I asked them if it was possible to replace it, and sadly although I only owned it four months I was told " It may be time for a new thigh master as the product is not designed to last forever."   Last time I checked, four months is NOT anywhere near forever.  A year, six months maybe, but when you divide the cost of a thighmaster by the amount of time I owned it, the costs outweighs the benefits.  It is even less comforting that the company wasn't surprised or alarmed by their product's short lifespan.  It seemed that if four months is akin forever to the people at suzannesomers.com, then the product's usage expectancy is not much more than that.  It makes me unhappy to have ruined such a handy little device with normal wear and tear, but I can't really afford to buy a new one every four months.  I just wanted to give everyone a heads up and let you know that although it is theoretically a great product, the durability is highly dubious.  And the suzannesomers.com, who referred me to the manufacturer's warrantee only think that a thighmaster should work for three months maximum.

Does the unit work??,...Well yes to a degree. It takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances. The display is poor and though they say "up to 40 objects per hole" there is normally 2-4 objects per hole. All this depends upon the Skycaddie course recorder. The user (you) can not modify the course or add any objects that the  course recorder didn't think was important.
Now the bad part. The unit attaches via button and belt clip (like a cell phone). My button (part that attaches to main unit) has died twice in the first 30 days. When it breaks again,...which it will often,..the unit will probally hit the dirt. This isn't good. But fear not. It will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with Skygolf. And another week to get a replacement button (which has been modified even weaker than the original one). Now my replacement broke on the first time I clipped it to the belt. Now back to Skycaddie to get another. After being on hold for another hour, they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts. This will take another hour. You then get a message to leave a message. Normally within a week someone will call you back. By normally I mean about 35% of the time you leave messages they return them. Would I buy another,... duh,.... NO

I got this POS for Christmas because I was excited by the ad, the concept, and Natalie Gulbis.  It' a neat idea and I love gadgets.  Upon removing it from the box it looks and feels cheap, like a happy meal toy cell phone.  Cheap plastic and a poor LCD screen.  If that were it, I could live with it, but I can not get this thing to connect to the website to down load the necessary software.  I have been trying all day, from different computers, and still nothing.  I call the support number, sit on hold for about fifteen minutes and then it just hangs up on you.  This is a fairly expensive toy.  You would think SkyGolf would spens a little less money on advertising and a little more on R& D.  This thing is junk.  Stick with a Bushnell 1500 PinSeeker instead.  Traditional rangefinder, but it works great.  Nothing to crash, no support needed, and IT WORKS!!!  I am sending this expensive piece of junk back first t hing tomorrow.  The sad thing is, SkyGolf is destroying its image and reputation.  If they had put a little more effort into their development, and actually had someone there to answer the phones, this could have been a really nead golf tool that people wouldn't mind paying for.  The annual $20 membership fee is no problem, if it works.  Right now, I wouldn't pay $20 for the unit its self, let alone the membership.  Don't waste your money on this... well, I was going to call it an expensive paper weight, but it wouldn't even work for that... it weighs about as much as a sheet of card stock.

The cardboard shipping container for this bike was broken through and open in several places, which could have been the result of poor design of the packaging and/or inept handling by the shipping company.  A fender was bent and some of the paint was scratched.  The front brake was difficult to adjust because there did not seem to be enough wire.  A required tool, a 5mm allen wrench, was not provided. I have not attempted to adjust the gears because it seems too complicated, however, the bike seems to perform adequately as is.

As the previous reviewer said, I can see this being passable as a one player score keeper. But don't make a mistake, it's impossible to correct. If it is possible, I don't know how as there are no directions. Using it for more than one player is tedious and not practical. With the buttons the way they are, its going to get bumped and errors made. And you probably won't even know it.

Just a horrible design and a waste of money

Overall the item works well.  If keeping track of one player it is just fine.  When trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player.  To play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two

I bought this for my mountain bike with large suspension forks.  I tried the instructions to find the proper placement of the sensor but that was useless as it just has a picture for this part.  No recommendations for proper location.  Then I found the only way the system would register a rotation is to have the magnet touch the sensor.  So now I have an annoying clicking and am wondering when it will actualy break from the constant contact.  Going to send it bac

To describe these as "light and cheap" is exactly right.  And neither is a compliment.  My Thera-band handles started crumbling after only a few weeks of regular (3 or 4 times a week) use.  The foam rubber on the handles is obviously cheap quality and started fraying at the edges.  After picking up several chunks of foam off the floor, I learned that tying my own handles at the end of the Thera-band stretch bands works better -- and is free.

These handles simply are not sturdy or well-made enough to hold up for the use they are intended for.  Save your money

My Mom wrecked badly on this the first time out, due to the difficult-to-control steering.  Very awkward handle bars...several of us tried to ride it.  My friend--a fitness pro & personal trainer--put it best by saying "That's the most uncomfortable bike I've ever ridden." 
Mom ended up giving it to a charity bike drive.  I hope somebody likes it. :-

If you decide to purchase this bicycle, may I offer some advice.  If your bicycle arrives missing a part, please immediately return it to the store where it was purchased.  My wife's bicycle arrived minus the front fender with bolt.  The folks at the Customer Service Department at Pacific Cycle were understanding and said that I would receive the missing parts with 10 business days.  After two weeks passed, I called again, this time the parts were on backorder.  Curious, I asked why I wasn't told that two weeks earlier.  "You have to dig down in our system", was the answer.
I asked when I might receive the missing parts.  "Could be two or three more months", she replied.  When I suggested that two months was a long time, she said something I didn't expect, "You know, there's no reason that you can't ride the bicycle without the fender"

I would like to tell you my opinion of the bike, but I never even got to see it.  The company that amazon uses to ship the bike (Eagle freight) lost my bike (even with a tracking number!) They refused to admit this after several rounds of calling and waiting on hold. Even the supervisor never returned my phone call. I explained the situation to amazon and they were very helpul and offered to send out a replacement immediately, but unfortunately they would only send it by Eagle, so I took the refund.  If you want to pay a small amount for a bike, buy it here.  If you want to actually own a bike and ride it, buy it somewhere else

I've been using harbinger since mid-90's and all of them share the same problem: after a few months the begin to smell like wet rag, a recurring odor after handwash, machinewash, sun exposure. I am embarassed to use them. This particular model is in its second year of use at first, they seemed too bulky to completely clench your fist without some feeling of vascular obstruction an effect exacerbated by the rubber pieces that form the non-slippery grip; sometimes i prefered to use my basic pair without all that fancy stuff. Now that some rubber has fallen they feel better. As of now they are dismembering at the seams, they still smell bad (3-4 working sessions a week, &lt;2 hours, good care).  I am moving to another brand hopping they will behave better maybe GoFit or Valeo or Nike. Try neoprene perhaps

I have had very bad experiences with this company in the past.  There is absolutely no support for any repair to their products whatsoever.  If there's a problem in the first 90 days, you're fine.  After that, you're up the creek - and this is particularly true of any item with electronics in it.  As all their components are manufactured in Asia, they have no way of repairing or replacing any component of your items should anything go wrong with them in time.

Be very careful with these people, as you're likely to pay a lot of money for a very pretty, non-functioning bookend

We bought this boat 4 years ago when my oldest (of three) was a baby.  I totally agree with the others who have said that it is tippy and not safe.  We only used it a couple of times because he would just pitch forward or from side to side.  We used it when he was between 5 and 9 months old and able to sit up, and still had this problem. Maybe an older, much more stable child could use it, but it is advertised for use with infants and it's just not worth the trouble of trying to balance your baby in this thing

I bought this boat for my son when he was 8 months old.  He liked the boat well enough...even played with it when it was sitting on dry land.  However, in the water, this boat is VERY tippy, requiring two adult hands AT ALL TIMES.  Not good if you have more than one kid and NEED that extra hand.  I bought a much sturdier boat that still of course needs constant supervision but is great and can be used for more than one summer.  I wouldn't recommend anyone put their baby in this boat

Small holes, unstable, no space for the bum. My daughter cried everytime we tried it. We had a Pool School deluxe baby float before but we left it at the pool and it dissapeared. She loved that one. I could not find it in the store so I bought the Swim School and am regretting it.
Buy the Pool School!

Then when I sent an e-mail trying to exchange the product, no one returns my calls or e-mails me back, after so long of trying it's already past the 30 day exchange policy.

This bed was a real disappointment from the beginning. We actually thought we had received the wrong bed because there certainly is nothing like memory foam on it. It's just a fabric cover, perhaps with an extra layer of material, but it CAN'T be foam. Maybe only 1/4" thick at most. Then, after 4 months some of the inner cells must have separated because there was a 4" rise on both the top and bottom of a cell area and it felt like more were starting to detach internally. BAD BED

The product information states that this bed has 1 inch of memory foam, they must round that number up to the closest inch because there was maybe 1/2 inch.  We didn't even bother to blow the thing up, utter junk, returned for something cheaper and better put together (we hope). if I could give this a negative star rating I would.

and after using it a few time si relized its flaws 
first its too damn small 
its accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crap 
and doenst do squat in heavy battles
and the clip is a reduiclus system of   shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystem 

buy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it

Both me and the mat slide all over the place. It has no traction whatsoever and is absolutely not suitable for anyone who does yoga on a regular basis.

There was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation.

I purhased a crank puller tool for $21.44 (incl tax), a crank wrench for $18.18 (incl. tax), and grease for $6.38 to repair this brand new bicycle.

Upon disassembly I found two (2) metal shavings, each about 0.25 inches in size, that appeared to be from drilling.  I have saved the two (2) metal shavings.

I removed the metal shavings, cleaned and re-greased, and the clicking noise and vibration was fixed.

Since this was a brand new bicycle, it would seem reasonable to reimburse me for the tools required to repair it.  The total cost, not including and labor, is $46.00.

The day we received the stroller we were very excited. We put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction.  However, when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow. Of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming. We have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company.  I would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time

I saw this ad on TV today and about to purchased from here at Amazon instead of zone pilates' web site. I kept reading reviews and one reviewer (Evelyn from FL) mentined that the ring would not stay on the body. Actually, I was thinking the same. I was about to purchase and saw s/h fees (about $15). Also her "Keep on looking" and I did. I found out "Everlast for Her Pilates Fitness Ring with DVD" here at amazon for only $14.99 (ASIN: B00091RYZY ) and "Bally Fitness Ring for Pilates with DVD" $17.99 (ASIN: B000H3YNR6 ). Both are very identical to this zone pilates and eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25. Sorry, my review will not be helpful for the seller of this zone pilates but maybe for actual customers, like me.

PS. I have similar pilates rubber resistant ring and it doesn't stay put on the body, especially near the hip. It is good for toning my legs though. I really want the butts from the models of Zone's commercial. Maybe I can try with Everlast ring with half price.

Update 1/11/07: I received my Everlast ring yesterday. The physical ring is very identical to this Zone ring but actual workouts are quite different. I really like Zone's workouts from commercial (you can also watch again from their website), especially for buns & thights. I wish I can purchase just DVD from Zone with low s/h :)

Update 1/16/07: I'd also purchased this Zone Pilates from Walmart (~$25+7 s/h) and received it yesterday. It was a huge mistake! The ring is very identical to Everlast, not any better (rather slightly heavier). The accompanied DVD has only 2 workouts and they last only about 10 min. and the second workout is slightly modified from the first one. They were not as effective as Everlast's workout DVD, which is more precise and has better menu. The instructor from this Zone Pilates, Kim Stoneman, has flabby belly and sloping buttocks! It seems like she is not using her own ring unless it's not effective as advertised and she proved that! Very un-motivating for me! She stands in front of a still camera so we cannot see particular movements from different angle (unlike Everlast, you can see those). Zone Pilates advertised with a different model with pretty body but you cannot see her in the workout DVD. Don't waste your money to belive the commercial and purchase this Zone. I'll return mine to Walmart ASAP

be forwarned, that this is more for isolated toning legs, arms, shoulders.hips,  rather than pilates workout. does not strengthen the core muscles like pilates does and may weaken them.  The trainer on the dvd has flabby abs, and thick torso,  rather than long lean muscles and core muscle strength that is usually found when doing pilates workouts. i found the equipment bulky and awkward to use, hard to hold my body in good alignment and almost impossible to do the exercises from my power center, very disappointed in dvd training that accompanies the set. and serious questions about whether this routine weakens the abs, after my experience with it and seeing the condition of the abds of the trainer.  It is not up to the caliber of what I have come to expect from pilates. also feel there is risk of injury related to difficulty of holding body in correct alignment, as equipment kept slipping down or up. Need to go back to the drawing board on this one, there are better, less expensive, better made options out there, with better training. Keep on looking.

I just got mine 3 days ago. I can see that it might help toning the areas. And the video is not annoying. What is a problem is the WONDERFUL bruising on my legs where the device sits for the workout. I didn't purchase this item for weight loss, I thought it would help for toning. But the bruises, while they may go away with continued use, are not worthe the $$. I am sending mine back today. Sorry

I purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months. The resistence motor is defective which is what I have had replaced 3 times now. This motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program--upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus. 
The positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus. Ovewrall I cannot recommend this product.

Okay, here's the bottom line.  If you're just getting into airsoft, this could be an okay gun for backyard can shooting or whatnot.  But if you're actually looking to get into the sport competitively, look for a Classic Army or Tokyo Marui AUG.  It will be more expensive, but it will be quality.  The number one rule of the airsoft world is: You get what you pay for.  This is a cheap gun, and it's going to perform like a cheap gun.  If you're looking for a decent cheap gun, let me recommend the UTG Warhawk, UTG MP5 or some of the CYMA MP5 line

Graber should be ashamed of themselves for this product... This rack will scrape the paint right off your bike; the arms of the rack that fold closed pop out of place with a bike on the rack sliding your bike around; the rack itself does not stay in place despite trying bungee cords, ratchet tie-downs, etc.  This was a complete and total waste of money - AND damaged my bike.  On top of all that, it is NOT an inexpensive rack!  Save yourself aggravation and choose a different rack..

I got this Heart rate monitor and the strap was way too small so I had to order a replacement strap when I went to change the strap the battery was dead the battery lasted only 1 week.  so I had to buy 2 new batteries one for the watch and one for the chest strap and now there is a line of pixels out on the screen of the watch.  I am going to get a forerunner those seem allot better.  I was very disappointed with this my Suunto dive computer is great this HRM sucks.

Face is made of cheap plastic - it scratched within an hour of putting it on.  Watch had about 20 scratches and dimples after 2 weeks.  I've been wearing a cheap Casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it.  Other problems include- the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly, for example when I put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat; also, the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive, with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch.  Finally, the watch is very well photographed in the ad, and doesn't look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality

Brutal, horrible instructions! No pictures! No clear, concise steps to follow.   It took 2 people to set up and just as previous reviewers mentioned, nothing fits properly.  It's very flimsy and unsteady.  I was extremely frustrated and dissapointed in this product so I returned it.  Don't waste your time and money. Spend a little more and get a better product.

Positive:
 -Size, good surface area
 -Chipping net

Negatives:
 -Poor instructions
 -Very hard to set up by yourself.  Really takes 2 people, because nothing fits tight, so as you try to get one side in, the other side pops out.
 -Nothing locks in.  Plastic caps to hold rear poles don't fit tightly.  The 'male' sticks that go into the 'female' section of the rear poles are not tight, so a wind from the rear pushes it over.

I have had to make some modifications to this item to make it usable.  I taped some eyelets to the bottom of the rear poles and attached to ring with caribiners.  I've had to tape the caps onto the top of the rear poles and add some tape to the ends of the front pole to make it snug

I purchased this screen arbor for protective coverage outside but the material portion is hard to fit over the piping to tie it down. Next the  piping that holds the form is not at all sturdy. the first time the wind picked up, it blew the whole thing apart. So for a one time use it is okay...The money spent on this was a waste. It also looked in places like it had already been repaired. (seconds) as in 2nd class merchandise

I never got to use the product. Upon opening, I realized the sizing details on Amazon's website was different than the one on the box. I am 5'5" and the 65cm was too big for me although Amazon states it's just my size

The reason  I gave it one star is because of how it affected my body. I am an athletic person and very agile, but this is one of the workouts that I will never do again. 

I have arthritis and that causes major joint pain and this workout focused all the pain unto my joints in my knees and I was in tears. I had to stop this workout about 5 minutes into it. My knees were hurting for almost 3 days after and I could hardly walk.

I'm sure if you are in perfect health this might work for you, but if you have any type of arthritis or any joint pain, please stay away from the ball workout.

I agree with the previous reviews that say Hydrocoach is not accurate.  Instructions say to take deliberate sucks. Even with that, not all ounces register.  It might only register 12-16 ounces after filling the 22 ounce bottle.  I like gadgets but this $30 water bottle is not worth it.  It would have been better if you fill up the bottle and press a button when you drink all the water in it adding 22 ouonces each time

I agree with the other reviewers that the idea for this product was going in the right direction, but took a bad turn somewhere. I get lightheaded trying to suck hard enough on the straw for it to register, and even when it does it is consistently 8 to 10 ounces off the mark of what I've actually consumed. And if you're really thirsty, forget it - you'll pass out before ever getting enough fluid to quench your thirst. At $30, it's a hefty price to pay when it's much simpler to just refill a 20-ounce plastic bottle 3 times a day. Sorry to say I'll be returning my HydraCoach

I was extremely disappointed in this item.
I think it is a good concept, but it doesn't work well at all.  it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it.  I tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that I drank anything.  it is awkward to drink from too.  I can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market.  not worth buying.  just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation

The first unit was installed as directed and when it was working it was fine. The problem was it would just stop working and this was most of the time. I exchaned several e-mails with customer service rep Pat. She was extremely nice and suggested I send it back for a replacement.

The second unit was installed as directed and worked flawlessly for a couple of months. It now works a bit better than the first one. Instead of stops working most of the time, this one stops working some of the time. I have decided to keep this one because of the bother and expense of shipping it back for a replacement. And who knows, the next unit may not work at all.

Not a good product for Amazon to be selling.

I am not a big spender, but unlike a lot of things, the more money you spend, the better bike you get.  I really didn't want to spend a lot for a bike for a 5-year-old, and I wish I would have gone with my first instinct and bought one from a bike shop.  I'm so frugal that I couldn't stand the idea of paying $140 for a bike for a kid, so I got this one instead (which was actually more expensive when I bought it.)  This is a mediocre bike at best, MAYBE one step above a big box store bike, just maybe.  I wanted a simple bike that would last while, but I will be surprised if this one makes it one summer.  Paint chips easily and the white bike seat is clean for only the first few minutes out of the box.  The components seem cheap and the frame does not seem very solid.  The difference between this one and a good (expensive) bike is huge.  I had a bike shop put it together and I added a basket, so the difference between what I paid for this and what I would have paid for a good bike was about $30.  I'm kicking myself now.

You've got a lot of ab-rollers. You need a gimmick: The product is  no better than the competition. You don't have an ad budget. What do you do?  CHARGE FOUR TIMES AS MUCH. Then just sit and wait for the 'clients' who are looking for a 'quality' product to assume that the high price actually means something

I bought mine at the same Toys R' Us Sale and had the exact same issue. Both my husband and I own Trek bikes and it wouldn't work his bike at all. It fit on mine only to find out that my heels would hit the footrest of the carrier. I woulud only recommend buying if you have the patience to install it on your bike only to find out that it won't work comfortably while you're riding. Not to mention that my two year old is very tall and he didn't look comfortable in it anyway. The free helmet is way too small for his head. We've returned it and have yet to purchase a different one yet. I think we're going to a bike shop

I bought this seat for $40 on sale at toys-r-us, since it stated it would fit "most" bikes.  I followed the directions that came with the seat, and that made it impossible to install on both bikes that I tried it on.  After several choice words and approximately 2 1/2 hours later per bike (5 hours total), I finally had this piece of crap installed, only to find out that both my and my wife's heels grinded against the footrests of the seat.  DO NOT buy this piece of crap, it is not worth any amount of money as far as i'm concerne

I was desperate for a fast way to get my youngest child to the park when my older children ride their bicycles. Unfortunately the only thing in stock anywhere was this seat. And it took me all morning to get it put together. The holes for the straps to go into were so small I had to widen them with a screwdriver and shove them through the holes with the screwdriver as well. The screws to attach the seat to the seat post of my bike were too short, and the washers needed to be pried together. Finally I was nearing the final steps, when lo and behold, I was missing a piece.  I call customer support, which is at Bell, not Fisher Price or Mattel. I was on hold for 20 minutes before I was able to speak to anyone.  Then when I spoke to the representative, she put me on hold to speak to her supervisor for another 15 minutes. This happened twice. Their solution to my missing piece? Use a zip tie, "We don't ship that piece separately."  

Excuse me? You make a mistake, you fix it. Regardless of whether or not "the piece is shipped separately. Ridiculous. And at the end of the conversation, there was no apology offered, no attempt to make the situation right. Ugh.

So now, I have nothing to show for my morning of effort.

Also, I attempted to adjust the strap on the seat to see how it would fit my daughter. I sat her in the seat, and she BARELY fits. She is two years old, barely weighs 23 pounds, and is tiny. I have no idea how a child any bigger than her would even fit in the seat. I had hoped to use this seat for family rides for the nextfew years. That would NOT happen with this seat.

So, it is going back to the store, and I am buying a Kettler Flipper, or a Bobike Maxi, or a Topeak.  I will steer clear of Bell products in the future!

Oh, and to top it all off, the helmet provided with the seat has the plastic cover peeling off without me even removing it from the packaging!! Worthless.

Save your time and your money, avoid this seat at all costs

I found the size range to be completely missleading. My child was just shy of 5 and weighs 42lbs. She is 42 inches tall and found herself to big for this seat. Her legs were right up against my seat and was very uncomfortable.  The bottom line if she is this uncomfortable at her age what would a 7 year old be

We bought this for our 2 year old daughter.  It was a nightmare to put together, then it did not fit.  Becareful when installing in larger mountain bikes.  We bought a 20inch frame, men's mountain mike and it was 3 inches too short of fitting.  Not worth it!!

If you search for the keyword 'Illuminator LED Flashlight', you'll find that this same item is offered from varies sources at wildly different prices. So naturally, you should just go for the lowest price, right? Not so fast...

I already bought one Illuminator flashlight elsewhere (see my "Customer Images' above), and was going to order a few more as gifts. The lowest price I found here is from 'IGgFactory Handhelditems' at $7.95. But during checkout, I found out that their standard shipping and handling fee is $8.21 for just one item. The flashlight itself weights only 7 oz., but the company charges 4 lb. for shipping weight. What a rip-off!

With such inflated shipping cost, you may be better off buying this item from local drug stores (such as Walgreen) for $15. At least there you can return the item easily if you're not happy with it.


[Update on Jan 21, 2007]:
Please check out my review for the Garrity Power Lite, where I have made a comparison betweeen it and the Illuminator. It is my opinion that the Garrity is a better flashlight.

In my opinion, this thing is flimsy and worthless.  I set it up in the doorway and it is so poorly designed that it just doesn't hold.  Once you bring the bar crashing into your forehead on your first or second chin-up, you realize that you've already thrown away your money and now it's time to throw away this product.  I ABSOLUTELY agree with the reviewer who cautions against making this product available to kids without close supervision

I've had my Suunto Advizor for 16 months. I am now in Iraq and the bezel is broken-off, like the other reviewer. I dont have my receipt. You can go to the Suunto website, but one thing you won't find there is an address with a note that says: 

"send your broken expensive plastic watch here and we will fix it."

My G-shock, by comparison,lasted longer than I wanted it to and cost one-quarter of what the Suunto cost.

So I give the Suunto one star, for being adventure-cool for a while. A lot of other Infantrymen own these, so I jumped on the bandwagon. I wish I had stuck with a regular watch and a GPS (with lensatic compass backup).

This is the first review that i have done on amazon. So far i have purchased over a dozen items on Amazon and by and large i have been content/happy with all of them except this product.

This product is made of a cheap hard plastic and the assembly socket for one of the bars actually cracked when it was assembled.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Shell out about five bucks more for all metal push-up bars

I held high hopes for the product - being that I live in a little apartment in NYC, I was looking forward to saving space.  The tune-up stand is little/portable, however it was not too sturdy.  The bike, while on the stand, will not withstand much torque at all.  The bike fell over many times before I gave up and purchased another bigger/more sturdy stand.  Forget about turning the crank, the slightest movement of the crank creates too much torque for the little stand and the bike falls over.  This stand would be good for LIGHT work - possibly a light tuning of the brakes or a wipe down with a rag. Any pressure whatsoever would necessitate a bracing hand on the frame of the bike.  Overall a 2/5 because it may be okay for a little person's bike or a bmx.  I used it on a men's road bike size 57.

You cannot sit upright in this chair. Bad for soccer games (why we bought it). The chair is designed to lean back. THe company is not Amazon and would not take back without more postage charges than the chair is worth. Unless you plan to sleep in this chair, it stinks

I got one of these because it was only a penny. I used it several times with only a slight crack that I later cemented. Later I used it again, and, while cocking it back, the whole top piece just splintered into many pieces. The gun is fun for about the first few tries then it's prone to jamming up. Even though it was only a penny, it was $4.99 shipping. I'm better off getting one for about a dollar at a flea market. I'm not very satisfied, but I'm not spending 40 cents to get my 1 penny back

I just saw this toy in Parents Magazine Sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at Target this week. I ran to get it since my [...] son is too short to use his hand-me-down red tricycle. It looked like lots of fun in the picture, however, my son is too big for it! I don't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old- no way! If it were adjustable, I'm sure he would have loved it, but just like another reviewer stated- it's just like the other ride-on toys we already own. Currently, the Scuttle Bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store. How disappointing

 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. 
 
Why by a gun from these guys? If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back. Want a refund? You pay a 15% restocking fee. Take a pass on Airsplat.

I ordered this sleeping bag on 12/07/06, I chose standard shipping which is 3 to 5 days. This was more then enough time I needed to have the sleeping bag arrive before Christmas. Here it is 01/10/07, and still the sleeping bag has not arrived. My account says it was shipped on 12/11/06. When I track the item it says expected delivery date is 01/31/07. Nothing was EVER stated when I placed the order that the delivery date would be 01/31/07. Only 3 - 5 days. This is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard! I had other items placed with this order that I have received off and on out of the blue before and after Christmas. There are 3 all together that I NEVER received at ALL from TARGET. I counted on these items for Christmas and I am very disappointed with AMAZON and TARGET. I have done alot of business with Amazon and in the future I will NEVER, NEVER give any of my business to AMAZON if the order is connecrted to TARGET in any way!!!! TARGET & AMAZON deserve 0 stars for terrible service, and false advertisement!

Ive never done a review before because I have never been so disgusted with a product.

Ive had mine a few weeks. Used it twice a week.. which equals roughly 10 uses so far. Well, just now the little knob that gets screwed in to hoold the arm in place to prevent it from swinging BROKE.. cracked right in half as I was turning it with my fingers. I didnt even put any weight into it!!

Last week the nut that holds the eye hook and entire weight of the heavy bag fell off sending my bag crashing to the ground. I dont know why they wouldnt put something more permanent up there instead of a 2 cent nut.

The design is terrible. Rather than have the supports and screw holes run the length of the wall studs they have then run so you  mount two in the studs two in the drywall.. unless of course you do the wood mount like another user suggested ( which is what I did ).

TKO just lost me. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from them again. Seventy dollars for this CHinese made garbage. Im sure the welds will be the next thing to go. 

Buyer bewar

This is a nice bag with a fatal flaw.  The major zippers break very easily.  After my first bag broke within a few months, Amazon kindly provided a free replacement.  Deja vu ensued.  For a few extra dollars, Delta could use more robust zippers--they really should.

I realize the price being so low that I would not receive a top of the line bike cover which is fine.  I did expect to receive a cover which would fit my brand new average size mountain bike ~ it does not.  since it does not fit over both tires, the plastic snaps that cinch it tight do not come together to make a complete unit.  I have to use clothes pins in certain areas to seal the cover in enough area to make the cover at least somewhat useable.  My tires and rims are left exposed to the elements and thus are getting mud and moisture on them when it rains.  Even the picture to the right of this review shows the cover with ample room all over the bike ~ very misleading!
Very disappointed

This waterproof fanny pack is not waterproof. We tried it on two separate occasions, both times fully closing each seal, but water leaked through anyway, soaking the contents. When I tried to return the item, the seller refused to accept it, claiming that its own tests showed it was working properly. Despite what the company now says, the fact is that the item was defective. I see from the other reviews that this is not an isolated problem, and the fact that the merchant refuses to honor its return policy means that customers should be very wary of doing business with this company

We bought two fannypacks, one for ourself and one for our friends who were going with us on our trip.  We were doing  some shallow water snorkeling, no diving.  My husband wore our fanny pack which contained his wallet and our passports.  Our stuff got soaked!  Why our friends worked we and ours didn't is anybody's guess, possibly ours had a defective seal.  These fanny packs have a seal just like a food storage bag and I know some of them don't seal right!

My daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them.  She learned how to move about on them although a year later she's still quite wobbly.  The shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use. My problem is that there really is no way for her to stop. No knob brake like normal skates have, so most of the time she's pretty out of control or walking like Frankenstein. Also, the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own, so we have to dot it for her. It wasn't like that when I first bought it, though. We bought her normal skates for Christmas to replace these.

This gun is horrible. I bought this for my friend and let me tell you it was a waste of $$$. First off it is a 3/4 scale gun so it is very small and very light, if you were to drop it it would deffinitly shatter. Also the cocking system is terrible on the top there is a lever you have to pull and if pulled in the wrong spot it will snap off and then it would be useless. When we did end up shooting it the bbs wentd straight for about 5 or 10 ft then curve down, so unless you are going get within five ft of a person it is useless, even if you do get that close he wont even jump the fps is more like 270 not 370. Also the clip is an absolute pain to load first you pour all the bbs into a chamber, then you pull down a spring and shake it upsidedown fot the bbs to gome onto the front chambet then you have to release the spring and put the clip in the gun. After about 10-15 shots you have to take the clip out and repeat the process. Granted it holds 180 or so bbs you can only shoot about 15 at a time. Over all this gun STINKS. I bought it when it was originaly 100.00 but the list price was 10.00 so I thought it was going to be decent, but i was wrong. SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!!!!!

I wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country.  This retro designed, one speed, steel framed, coaster braked, comfort  bike seemed to be the ideal choice.  When it arrived, I pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it.  The first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are NOT included in the manual (which seems to cover every bike but this one). How hard could it be to write up instructions (with tool specifications)for EACH model they manufacture?  A one page flyer could have done the trick. To further complicate  matters, some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes.  

It turned out that I couldn't complete the assembly, because I couldn't find a tool to handle the quick release hardware for the seat attachment.  I had to take the bike to a bike shop to complete the assembly.  Even the bike shop had problems with this bike, because there is so little clearance between the fenders and the tires.  I watched while they had to bend the sides of the back fender out by hand, so that it wouldn't rub the tire.  

When I got the bike home, the first thing that I did was to adjust the seat to the correct height, and take it out for a ride.  Within 10 seconds the seat slipped all the way down.  The quick release handle can't hold the seat in place with the weight of a rider on it (I'm not that heavy).  Chrysler should have taken the retro design a step farther on this, and drilled holes in the seat stem for a rod insert to adjust the seat height.  

Rather than try to dis- assemble this and box it up to return it...I will check to see if I can drill the seat stem myself to get the seat secured at a ridable height.  Its too bad they couldn't come up with a workable design for such an essential part of the bike as the seat height adjustment!  The points I do give here are for the otherwise sturdy frame, and tires that will work well for unpaved trails...when I can finally ride this.

This thing simply does not work!
I bought this prodcut for my mountain bike and I cannot even believe someone manufactures a false stuff like this. 
It cannot even hold the weight of my bike and bends out to side and eventually my bike falls.
I tried to adjust the distance between the two archs to fit the tire width to see if I get better result but no luck.

I just got the sword and I liked it but I thought that it was a little small. Then the sword broke from its hilt on the third day that i had it!!!!! Now you might think that I was doing careless things to it but i just swung it a few times slowly in the air and i realized that the sword wan't on there very good. After that I was just swinging it slowly around the house and it just fell off.
    So don't buy the sword if you going to do ANYTHING but look at it

I bought this gloves so I wouldn't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime I went for a bag workout. One reviewer is clearly confused. They said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand. Turns out there is no metal bar in it, but instead it was plastic or something similar. Then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag I wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles. This has never happened to me before and I have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years. Yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years. Another thing I noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags. They get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them. Gave these gloves 2 stars since I liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work. But they need to be greatly improved upon.

I used to have DDR for Xbox and when my Xbox broke on me, I decided not to spend the money on a new one. However, I missed my DDR workouts everyday so I bought this as a replacement. I should have spent the money on a new Xbox. This product is not worthy of having the name DDR on the box. Imagine a dance pad game for Atari. Then imagine it is the worst possible Atari game you have ever seen, and that would be a close description of this game. There are 50 computer generated "beeping" monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you. The rythem and the timing is off on all the songs, and the dance pad is very poor quality. It wasn't even worth the cost of the shipping to have it delivered to my home. I wish I had sent it back without opening it. Now I'm stuck with a game that even the pawn shop will not take.

This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution.  It is NOT DDR.  It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny.  My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it.  She received this for Christmas, tried it once and gave up within five minutes. She said, it says fifty songs but it plays just one.  Well, the 50 "songs" all sound the same.  They are not "radio" or "stereo" quality, rather just computer generated noise.  Totally awful.  Having tried it myself, I am very disappointed and don't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance.  Total waste of money and total false advertising.  This company should be investigated.  Believe the poor reviews and skip this product!!!!

My husband bought me this for Christmas, and we were both disappointed.  The graphics are awful, some give me a headache.  The songs are awful--they all sound alike.  Its the kind of thing you can do on a cheap keyboard.  The pad loses any sort of sensitivity very quickly.  I've had it two weeks, and already I'm hitting the arrows but its registering a miss.  I gave it two stars because my kids (ages 6 and 2) love it, but then again, they don't know any better.  I am using it to get better at DDR, but then I will invest in a better pad and game.

Before buying DDR, I read everyone's reviews, and thought that after all of the bad reviews I might still like it.  This product really fools you, this is why:
~If you've seen regular DDR you know what the pad looks like, well the dance pad and the box looks normal...untill you turn it on!
~It says 50 Songs, right? Well, it's not really 50 different songs.  About 20-25 of these songs are a trick-they combine 2 songs and make it into one track.
~The graphics are horrible...a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are.

I wouldn't reccommend buying this...at all

the pipe is too wide to let the two plactic disks run smoothly. I could barely assemble it together because it would not fit. maybe they sent me wrong disks. I do not know but i am very dissapointed with this purchase.
it does not work as well as i expected. also gofit web-page does not have the exact description of the item as it is indicated on the box that they send it packed it. waste of money...i would better buy it at the store and try it how it works

I just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together, expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when I unrolled it chinks of the mat came off. Very poor quality and I'm unsaitsfied. I would not recommend getting this mat.

I just found one of these while climbing the stairs down at the track today.  I brought it home and looked on the net for some info about it and found these reviews.  When I read that people are losing this thing all the time, I could believe it!  LOL
I'll enjoy it until it falls off and somebody else will inherit it.

I am not very happy with my new pedometer.  It falls off all the time, the face plate comes off and I have a very hard time making it stay back on.  The spring has now broke from the clip, so the pedometer won't even clip to my pants anymore.  I have to carry it in my pocket and it is too big for that.  I am disappointed with this purchase

I bought this pedometer when the ratings for it were 5 stars!  Now there are all kinds of bad reviews starting in 2007.  Too bad I bought it in December.  This is a piece of junk.  I thought I was ordering a mid-priced pedometer.  (It was $12 at that time).  I agree about it not staying on, and even though I followed the calibration instructions, the steps were never accurate.  I had an additional problem in that parts of the numbers were missing on the LCD most of the time.  So is a backwards three actually an eight, was that a one or a seven, is that 5000 or 6000?  I never knew.  The only time all the lines displayed making perfect numbers was when you cleared it to 0000.  I'll probably try a 'cheapy' from Walmart.  It will probably do better than this.

This pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking.  Those are the only good things I can say about it.  It simply does not stay on.  I, too, have had to use a safety pin to make sure I don't lose it.  Maybe I have a defective device, but this is anything but accurate.  I consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day.  One day the steps will be 5800, the next day 12800, the next day 10300.  Which is accurate?  Are any of them?  I can't rely on it.  When testing the device for accuracy in walking 50 steps, it never got it right.  Most of the time it was over the 50 steps, 2 times it was way under the 50 steps.  I would not recommend this one

I am on something like my 5th pedometer and until recently, I didn't want to invest a lot in one.  I bought this because I thought it looked cool and was a great price.  It fell off constantly!  For a few days I would pin it to my pants but that was time comsuming and annoying, not to mention painful when the pin stuck me!  It is fairly accurate, but who cares if you are always worried about it popping off and falling to the floor?  I finally invested in an Omron that not only stays on, but has a security latch you can attach to your clothing in case it does come off it will not fall to the ground.  I also bought it on Amazon, but it was around $18.99.  It stores a week's worth of steps for you so you can track your progress.  I am in love with my new pedometer, I wish I would have invested in this one first

I received this toy as a gift for my 1-year old son. It was one of the most frustrating toys he's had. The handle requires too much strenght to press down, so he was not able to operate it alone. He could press it down only when standing up (using his body weight), but the size of the spinner made it very inconvinient to play this way: he had to lean and  crouch. The noise that the balls make is rather loud (in my consideration) and can irritate the adults after a while, too. Because my son was already walking, this static toy got very little attention. The positive features: it is made of sturdy plastic and the colors are nice and bright

These gloves are well made leather gloves with an iron bar for good grip but they're very light and offer no support for the wrist or hand. In addition, the padding is very thin. I wouldn't recomend them for heavy bag or working with a trainer. They're probably fine for the speed bag. 

If you're going to use these gloves, at the very least also get yourself a pair of hand wraps or, like me, you'll probably loose some skin from your knuckles.

For not very much more money, you can get gloves that offer significantly more protection

I was extremely disappointed when I received this product.  Contrary to the description, the handles are hard plastic - not "comfortable and soft" as it states on the product packaging and website.  Other than that it may be a decent product, but after only a few reps your hands will hurt and will have the design from the grips imprinted on your skin.  I've already printed the label to return to Amazon.

Beware the other review of this product, the individual posted the same review for all ab wheels sold on Amazon.  Not only is it not informative, there is a good chance they have never tried the product

I purchased these as a replacement for some Joe Weider shorts I have had for many years that have started to wear out.

I bought 3 pair of these shorts, worn 2 of them 1 time each, washed them, and they both came apart near the seam.  The seams themselves did not come apart, but the actual fabric itself split in two like a 'run' in panty hose.  The third pair is still in
the box and I have not worn it, but I figure that the same thing will happen with it as well.

Also, one of the pair had one leg about an inch longer then the other leg. The one leg also fit tighter and you could tell the cut was wrong.

Like I said, very poor craftsmanship and materials

When I received the shipment, I was disappointed as all three kickboards were different sizes. when I placed the order, no where it tells that different colors kickboards are different sizes. Otherwise, I would have ordered kickboards in 'Blue' color.  The yellow and Purple kickboards are too small for me and my wife.

I was going to give this product a "3" because the trays acutally quite nice.  Just as the previous reviewer, I love handing out chips in them.  

However, I re-read the name of the product, and I had to change my vote to a "1".  These chip trays are not stackable which is really frustrating, not only during game play but afterward when I'm trying to store them

I bought this band in two strengths. It is advertised as "99.998% free of soluble proteins and latex allergens" and powder free and it is neither. I used them and got a skin reaction to latex which I would not have if it was only .02 % latex.

Customer service was helpful when I called.

Ninety dollars for this is unbelievable.  For less than $15 (that is less than one sixth the advertised price) someone with NO skill could make an equivalent product from pine 4x4s and 1x12s in 30 minutes or less.  It may not be "cool", but it'll get the job done.  Are you more interested in getting fit or having cool, trendy, and frivolous toys?

Avoid this plastic albatross.  It will be destined for a garage sale near you within two years. Go to your local hardware store, spend half an hour and $20 (and maybe learn how to work with your hands a bit) and get what you need without supporting this craziness...or--just go for a walk for free.

Save your hard-earned money

This was a very disappointing product.  Amazon delivered it in great time, but Razor is very misleading about the quality of this product.  It is too flimsy to remain upright while grinding it.  It is frustrating to be told by the Razor customer service AFTER the purchase, that it should be bolted down to the ground or bolted to a piece of plywood.  There goes the portability of it!  VERY DISAPPOINTING!

These are the short benches not the long ones that advertise on Television. The cardio video is entirely too fast. I teach aerobics twice a day and it's way too fast for a beginner even an advanced learner couldn't keep up. Also, the music is really boring. I use the benches for my own individual exercises not with the dvd

The first time I did this video I was in pain for three days. Each time I exercised to this video it got easier, but I don't have fun. I have nowhere to put the "fanny lifter" steps that I didn't realize were coming with the dvd and my boyfriend uses them as a table. If I could do it over I wouldn't buy this product, however, you will get an excellent workout. If you have more room in your house or apartment for equipment and you like an intense workout then get this video. (There is a person doing an easier workout throughout the whole video.

I will never purchase an item from BabyRide again. This canopy is MISLEADING. It said it keeps out the sun and it is made of net. The sun came right through and blinded my baby. Not only that. It is not worth the price!! You could go to a fabric store and buy the same netting for $5. Also, when I went to return the item they charged me a RESTOCKING fee which I had never heard of!!! Bad item. I ordered the Rayshade by Kiddopotamus and LOVED IT... get this one instead!

I also bought this because it was the Consumer Reports "Best Buy," and I expected to get a lot of use out of it. The frame broke on my first (I weigh 175 and run about 30 miles per week) after about 1100 miles, and its replacement just died after only 350 miles. So far I've paid about a dollar a mile. I'll never buy from Schwinn again

Schwinn - Nautilus  ZERO QUALITY CONTROL

The railings on the Schwinn 820p did not line up with the screw holes on the frame by several inches!  It was impossible to assemble.

With any quality control at all, these measurements are checked on every item that leaves the factory.  Human error is then not a factor.  This is a defect that should never happen. Schwinn/Nautilus has zero quality control.  That is simply a fact of the most basic quality control standards.  

You are therefore definitely taking your chances with this or any other Schwinn or Nautilus product.  With zero quality control, no telling what else can prove to be wrong.

And though the warranty says "1 year on parts", the warranty then goes on to say that there will be a charge for the installation of any defective or replaced parts.  So what is the 1 year warranty on labor?  Nothing, obviously.

I wish I never had purchased this product, myself

Because you can't give negative stars, I'll give this product one star.  I bought this product instead of the AbLounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight.

I'm glad this product was cheap, because it was the worst exercise machine I ever bought.  Everytime I swing on it, I feel it creak and wobble. I feel like its going to break under me each time I use it.

It makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser.  I've been useing it for a few months, and all its done is make me feel akward.

Don't buy this product if your plus size.  If your not plus size, go get the 210 lbs weight limited Ab Lounger Jack Knife System thing.  If your are of plus size, order THE BEAN full body (I just did)

This product is not fit for use in any circumstance.

It Definately Looks Great - But thats it!

The product (can't call it a gun) Broke in the first 5 hours of use, NOT COMBAT, play use with reasonalby responsible youngsters.

I am Extremely Dissapointed with the quality of the product.

I wrote two letters to the seller/manufacturer rep and no repsonse yet. 
Not surprised.

My son decided to spent 20 extra dollars on his replacemnt purchase and it WAS WELL WORTH IT.   We did not repeat buy and won't.

Learn from our mistake

I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.

I wish I'd read the reviews for this piece of junk before buying it.  I had the same problem many other reviewers here had: after using it for about an hour a day for less than two weeks, the cable snapped, rendering it useless.  This is just a poor quality machine, plain and simple

I bought this stepper to use when I am on the road for work.  After 3 days, 10 min/day the "PLASTIC" wheel bent out of shape and allowed the guide wire to fall off.  I replaced the wire and began again.  It was to no avail because the shape of the wheel was now distorted the wire would not stay in place and eventually the metal wire snapped.  The company, Spartan, actually replaced the entire stepper but the same thing happened.  The unit is rated for a max load of 220 lbs.  I am below that weight but it still broke.  If Spartan is serious about this product then change the plastic wheel to steel, or rework the entire mechanism.  This design flaw is totally uncalled for and easily corrected.  The rest of the construction appears to be sturdy except for this crucial part.  Since this product was manufactured in China it is easy to see that the company placed more emphasis on cost than reliabilty.  STAY AWAY!  This product was made for extremely light people, not for people who are serious about getting in shape and staying there

Amazingly, I had the exact same problem as the other reviewers.  I had mine for about 4 weeks, used it maybe 4-5 times a week, when I started to hear "snap - snap - SNAP"  The cable on it broke for me as well.  

It's supposed to support up to 220 or 250 lbs or whatever it is.  I weigh 180.  I also called the company and told them what happened, and that I wanted a replacement.  I was told it was on "back order" and the cable would be sent out as soon as they get them in.  After calling back numerous times, they continued to give me the same story.  I have since returned this thing to the online store where I bought it since they were NICE ENOUGH to understand the situation, and wanted to make ammends.

I have yet to receive my replacement part. 

Spartan Sporting Goods should be investigated THOROUGHLY!!!

I wish the review written in January was posted before I bought this thing.  I bought this as a present and the exact thing happened.  The cable snapped after only 2 weeks of use.  The ad states it holds 250lbs, but when you get it...the item states 220, which she was still below that, but the cable snapped anyway....STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM...FAR FAR AWAY.

This was given to me as a gift. I used it almost every day for about 1 1/2 months then a cable on it broke.It never even worked that well to begin with. I e-mailed the company for a new cable since it was covered under the warranty. They told me they had to order it from China and had no idea when it would come. They gave no apologies, they could not have cared less. EIGHT months later after I had already gotten rid of the piece of junk they sent it to me!!!!! I used it for 1 month the whole year!! How lame

I bought a GustBuster umbrella several months ago, expecting that it'd be the last umbrella I ever needed. Wow, was that a bad decision. This "windproof" umbrella had two of the spokes break in a light wind (the weather report said the winds that day were only about 15 miles per hour). So I e-mailed the company because I remembered that it had a "lifetime guarantee." They told me that I'd have to ship it back to them (which is perfectly fine), but I'd also have to pay them $10 for their trouble. What kind of lifetime guarantee is that? For $10 or less I could buy another umbrella locally. Their product has proven that it's NOT superior and it DOESN'T live up to the claims they make for it.

Don't spend all this extra money on a GustBuster because you think it'll work better. It won't. Go out and buy a normal umbrella for 1/3 or 1/4 the price of a GustBuster -- you'll probably get the same amount of use out of the normal umbrella, and you won't be paying an outrageous price for something that doesn't work the way their marketing claims

I car camp around 6 weeks a year. Every night on a different spot. I was looking for a light and sturdy table. Easy to setup and easy to pack. This table is not the right table for me. Yes it's light. That's the only good atribute I can find for this table. It's cumbersome to setup. The plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile. The end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled. It's low to the ground. I would not buy this table again, nor I would recommend anyone to buy it. I give it one star because I can't give it any lower.

The set-up was easy and the bikes were easy enough to load, but when used in a 2-in. hitch it wobbles like crazy!  I was a nervous wreck just driving across town watching our bikes sway 45 degrees on every right turn.  I had a neighbor who knows alot about bike racks look at it and he said it was assembled right, but it's just not that tight in a 2 inch hitch.

i did not pay head to the other reveiws, and bought this bike anyway.  the first day i had it, the back fender snapped off, leaving sharp points exposed.  sadly, we had to tell our 4 year old, on his birthday, that he could not ride the bike.  so we returned it and got another one.  not more than 30 mins after getting on the new one, than the "exhaust pipes" came off, leaving a VERY sharp screw exposed, then the tire came off and the rim broke, becuase it was plastic as well. also, the vinyl on the seat started to come apart.  

at this point, i had to return it, and fight to get my money back!!  it was a week after it had been delivered to the house.  i was to afraid that my kids would get hurt on this peice of junk.

please do not endanger your children by purchasing this bike!

I ordered this knowing that it would have its limitations, but I expected it to project sound at least a short distance. When we tried it out all we got was feedback. Words were not audible at all. When I contacted the seller I was told it was a novelty item only, which I think is a ridiculous answer, since even a novelty item should work a little... Maybe the one we got was broken. I didn't try again, since the seller didn't seem to think anything was wrong with it when I called, and the shipping, which was not refunded when I returned it, was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end

This item sounded great in the ad, but the only thing right in the ad is that it's pocket-sized. No one can understand what I say through it.  When the volume is turned up, the sound becomes fuzzy and incoherent. I thought this would be a great device, but no one can understand me 10 feet away, much less 200.  If you order this device, save the box it came in so you can send it back and get a refund.  WARNING: The shipping is non-refundable

This was a bitter disappointment.  One of the features we expected to get the most use from was the volume control.  However, if we raise the volume much more than a quarter of a setting, we get horrific feedback (screeching).  Nothing seems to help and when I sent a note to the manufacturer for advice, I never received an answer.  Unfortunately I'd already disposed of the packing info when we discovered the problem, so it looks like it'll hit the trash.  Save your money and don't purchase this item

This bench is a bit of a joke, unfortunately.  Having put the bench together myself, I can tell you the most flimsy part of the bench is the part you sit on:  It's particle board wrapped in thin vinyl sitting on two VERY small pieces of metal, balanced over the main structure.  I feel foolish for buying this bench.  

Between the shoddy construction and the fact that the bench is supposedly rated for a MAXIMUM TOTAL WEIGHT OF 300lbs -- INCLUDING YOU AND THE WEIGHT YOU'RE LIFTING, I think it would be a mistake to purchase this.  

The maximum width of this bench is only 3 feet.  It's narrow.  And small.

This bench went together quickly.  All the parts fit well and the instructions were decent.  Anyone with a simple set of tools and about a hour can handle it with no problems.  There are a few steps where a second set of hands help.  Craftsmenship of the parts themselves seems to be pretty decent.

However, this bench is simply not built for much weight.  It will wobble and flex.  It doesn't feel safe at all.  If you are serious about lifting you will quickly out grow the weight capacity of this bench.  

There are alot better benches out there for just a little more money

If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.

As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else

Overall, the system is useable but there are multiple areas of potential improvement. The most important area for improvement is the height of the weight bench. It is too high so there is no way to perform a traditional bench press. Second, the pegs that hold the weight bar in place are positioned where one would normally place their hands. There is no way around this other than narrowing your grip. The fly bars are awkward and tend to bang against the bench support. The lateral pull bar provides resistance through some palstic housing which I am pretty sure will wear out in a short period of time. The weight bench has basically been relegated to my off day strength work outs since it does not provide the stability and support for a vigorous weight session.

This product is actually quite small.  Even though is says mini, I still expected it to be a little bit bigger.  Also, it will not stand up with a drink bottle in it.  The seams on the bottom make it too unstable to stand alone

The Ab Roller was a big disappointment for me. It was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts. Then , once that project was done, I was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me. As a very petite(4'11")woman  my hands barely reached the top bar, making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly. So beware shorties out there

Received the ab roller and the box contained none of the hardware necessary for assembly.  5 days after emailing the company, they reply that they are unable to send the hardware and I must return it to them before they will send out a new box.  Very frustrating- I must drive 20 miles to the nearest UPS store to return it.
Wish I had just bought the thing at Walmart

I bought this pump and used it on three bikes, a total of 5 tires before the foot pedal bent, then broke.  If you need a pump, I suggest going to a bike store and paying for a good one.  I tried to go the inexpensive route and learned my lesson.  Bell products are cheaply made and don't last beyond a few uses.  Don't make my mistake and disappoint your kids on a Sunday when there's nothing you can do about it except to drive to the nearest gas station for air.  Stay away from this, and other "pedestrian" pumps.  Makes you wonder what a Bell helmet will look like after a spill

It only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs.  Doesn't run well over pine needles or leaves.  (Make sure to rake the yard before riding!) The acceleration in slow, the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens.  I spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing.  It stops when the child tries to make a tight turn.  All of this was on the grass-it was advertised as being rugged off-road capable, when in fact it only works on the paved driveway.  Don't hold your breath waiting on hold for live customer service person...it's been 3 days and still haven't heard!

You can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours. Forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride, because of the adapter it only charges while its on  the machine. There is no seperate battery charger.

We bought this cargo bag for a 900 mile trip from Pennsylvania to Florida. We didn't use it on the way there, but on our way home, we put two medium sized suitcases in it.  We barely made it 100 miles before the bag started coming unglued at the seams.  Fortunately (or unfortunately due to the color), we had a bright yellow roll of duct tape with us, so we were able to repair the bag as we drove.  After another 100 miles, we had to stop again and repair the bag.  We drove from Florida to Hilton Head, having to stop three times to repair the bag with the bright yellow duct tape.  From Hilton Head to Pennsylvania, the bag started to look like a nightmare of black, criss-crossed with yellow.  The last leg of our trip was nothing but a hassle, having to stop to fix the bag.  

The company has a 30 day return policy, but we missed that by a day, having ordered it two weeks before our trip and being gone for two weeks, and they wouldn't even work with us on it.

I have had this stroller for ONE day and I'm going to send it back or sell it. I am so disappointed. I was so excited for this to arrive. We set it up...instructions were a little shady here and there, and I try and adjust the seat. I have the strap pulled ALL THE WAY BACK and my two year old looks like he is almost laying down. He HATES it. He is a very happy kid and loves to ride in his stroller. He was miserable because he couldn't sit up and look around, plus the tray was at such a weird angle in relation to the seat angle that he couldn't even see the Cheerios on the tray from his angle! His Playtex sippy couldn't fit into the small hole for a drink in the kids tray, and my water fell out over and over again from the parents tray. The construction is great, the fabrics are nice....overall I could have given it five stars, but the seat positioning is SO extreme that it makes my son start to cry....that makes it a really crummy purchase. If you are wondering about which one to buy, DO not buy this one unless your kid loves looking at the sky all through your walks

I was very dissastisfied with the product.   The 16 inch DORA bike was a christmas gift for my youngest daughter.  We had to keep it in the box until Christmas Eve, so that she wouldn't find it.  When I started assembling it that night, we found no training wheels or SEAT.  I was very upset for obvious reasons, how do you tell a 4 yr old that Santa forgot the SEAT and training wheels for her bike

These goggles suck.  I swim an hour a day every day and not only do they scratch if a fingernail touches them, but they fog up in 5 minutes, fit terribly, are hard to adjust, and cause irritation around my eyes.  They leak water  and the different nose pieces are just a joke.  They go from tiny, a little bigger than tiny, huge, and then extra huge.  They don't fit!  What a waste of $15.  I've had similar success from goggles one can find at the grocery store.  They are only  $5, and they fog up and leak the same as these.

I love the idea of this... sleek, out of the way for transit but 
readily available on the road, protected when not in use.  Unfortunately,
the reality is a hard to use product that does little to improve road safety.
Because of the narrowness of the mirror, it's very difficult to focus on what 
is actually behind you with a quick glance.  Sure, if you sit there for 10 
seconds you can figure it out, but I don't have that sort of time when I'm 
dodging through Chicago traffic!

Save your money and buy the excellent Mirrcycle instead

Mirrors are too small and too distorted.  The picture on the package shows a perfect reflection - as if!!  

It's about as useful as taping two foil-wrapped sticks of chewing gum to your handlebars and expecting to be able to see reflections in them

Be sure you have a very flat, smooth surface for these bumper cars. There is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car. Our girls rode them in our driveway/sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway. We had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface. These are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court.

I hate to complain too much since this is a pretty cheap item, but just to warn others - I bought this because I wanted an ab bench.  It really doesn't suit that purpose too well since it was one incline position only for abs - the other positions are just back support for working with dumbells.  The ab position is pretty weak and doesn't really work your abs as well as an abs only bench would have, plus it is a bit uncomfortable and as the other reviewer said, if you are anywhere near 6 ft tall or over, get something else.  Combined with shipping - this is a waste of almost 100 bucks here - while usable, it really won't make an impact on your workouts.  I did a few sets of situps and really don't feel the tightness I would have if I used a real bench or even just sat on the floor for that matter.  If you're on a budget, this may work if you put something under the front base to put it on a greater incline and/or do situps holding weights - and make sure you pad it with a blanket or something - the position is just too awkard.  The fact that it's a multipurpose bench takes away from it as an effective ab bench - real ab benches are ONE smooth incline, not a perpendicular seat that bends down halfway which really stretches your back a bit too much in a direction it's not supposed to bend LOL

From the previous reviews it seems that this product doesn't deliver any satisfaction at all. Buy instead the wrist roller manufactured by proboxinggear.I bought one eight months ago and I loved it. I use it at home and even at the gym, since it is small and very light, so it fits in my backpack taken about the same space than my gloves.

The one I bought is really an excellent accessory, since is not only a Wrist exerciser, but a complete Forearm Strengthener. Simple to use, with no spring or moving or breakable parts, it looks like it will resist the hardest workouts and continuous use.

With simple rolling movements and as you gradually increase resistance by adding weight plates to it you strengthen hands, wrist, forearms and upper arms. I have considerably improved wrist stability and holding power, and also feel an Increased range of motion and flexibilit

Both the original order and the attempted re-order were missing the same parts (the plate that holds the weights on the end of the rope and the nut that holds the plate on the bolt at the end of the rope) when the item arrived.  I think that this is a design flaw in the packaging

i bought this bike(in the mermaid ariel theme)for my 2 year old daughter. the manufactor's age for this bike is 1 1/2 year and up. this bike is awful. the seat is set up like it would be on a normal bike BUT, the pedals are attached to the FRONT wheel like a tricyle- which make it IMPOSSIBLE for a child to reach the pedals while sitting on the seat. my 4 year old son can reach the pedals but, he even has a hard time riding it. its truly a waste of money and if i could find the receipt, i would take it back! it was a huge disappointment-as a Christmas gift. Whoever designed this bike did not have a child in mind. there is no way a child could ride this bike comfortably even if they could reach the pedals

When I ordered the product, I kept putting on my order for a medium size. When the final paperwork was sent for delivery, it said it was being shipped and it was a small. A small was sent, instead of a med., therefore
we could not use the product. If you can take care of this matter, with a return ticket for the small one, we would appreciate it

Though I bought this boxing glove with a $20 discount, I still think it was overpriced.

First, I had a hard time getting my hand into the glove and I only have medium-sized hands.  I make do with taped hands but using this glove with the "popular" Evergel hand wraps is out of the question.  (Tape's better than the Evergels anyway.)

Second, on one of the gloves, the Everlast label on the elastic wrist wrap started coming off, though I'd only just started hitting a heavy bag.  It's made of this cheap plastic-like material.  (You'd think for $100, you'd get a glove with every detail of medium to high quality.)  I cutoff the hanging label entirely.

Third, the product description states five distinct layers of foam are in the glove between your hand and point of contact.  With the 10 oz glove, it doesn't feel like anything special, just a thin layer of foam.  I'm not impressed with the padding.

Overall, the glove is of medium to low quality.  It even looks cheap.  (The leather is less than a millimeter thick and the stitching is ordinary.)  I'll use the glove as I've already spent the money, but my next glove I think is going to be a Title Platinum.  Unfortunately, Everlast seems to have gone the way of cheap mass production and net profit at the sacrifice of it's reputation

I wanted to confirm that I had the same experience as the other dissatisfied reviewers. The Everlast Bar comes with nuts that don't fit the screws. The nuts are laced with a hard inner plastic lining that requires you to use powertools to force the screw to chisel through. I returned it for a new one, thinking that surely this was a mistake, but the replacement had the same pieces. Horrible!

However, I was determined to make my purchase work, so I put it together with force. Once I had everything assembled, I found that the bar does not keep together by design; even with the screws pretty secured, the outer loops on the bar (they are supposed to serve as multi-purpose handles) can unhinge and detach from the bar, because their connection to the bar on one side is not secured by screws. That's absolutely ridiculous when this is clearly supposed to be keep you safely suspended in mid-air.

Thoroughly dissatisfied. I've used the Door Gym and it's much more secure than this

First off. The knife is great. I wouldn't expect anything less from swiss army. only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75%. And since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it, I give the knife a two. Only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well.

This machine is too easy. Even with the additional resistance bands, it's just not enough if you're an active person at all. The assisted crunch funtion is a joke and most of the moves are just as effective without the machine. I used it every day for a month (until I felt I'd gotten my money's worth) & now it collects dust. I'd sell it for $20 at this point just to get it out of my house. I see my Easy Shaper becoming a Goodwill donation in the very near future

This gun sucks!
-it has the worst range out of all the ones I own. When I lob it, I can only shoot twenty feet.
-fps sucks. i can shoot my hand two inches from the barrel and it doesn't hurt.
-flimsy. no joke, I dropped it when I was playing, and it shattered.
-accuracy is a joke. I have a walled backyard, and I was at one end. When I lobbed it, I hit the the wall once (20 ft away.) I fired it again (twice) and I hit 5 and 7 ft away from my mark.
-The one "good" thing about this gun is the price. 3 dollars is not bad for this piece of dog feces

The set is fine, however the crate was completely busted up.  I will think twice before I order an item so heavy for it was not packed well at all.  I was going to try and get a refund, but I am not going to pay to have it returned.  However, if the "Powers that be" might receive this e-mail - a new crate or bag would be wonderful.

Plastic junk.  Tried it once.  Wont try again.  Just get a piece of rope and cut it to size.  This thing is suppose to be adjustable.  Only with difficulty of yanking it through the handle.  The plastic rope does not turn properly so therefore it twists and kinks, leading you to trip over it.  Just get a piece of rope

We bought and then returned the Scuttle Bug.  It was well made and easy to snap together.  However, it was far, far too small for our 27 months old daughter - who happens to be very petite (only 25 percentile for height and weight). Her knees dragged the ground.  I think it is a cool product, but maybe for younger/smaller children.  We wound up getting a kiddio trike which is fantastic!!

Make sure that your bike is compatible with this trailer.  It doesn't work with every bike, it didn't with mine.  I called Allegro Medical several times to try and return it and they gave me a hard time about it saying I cant return it unless it is defective.  So now I have a bike trailer and a bike that don't work together and I'm out $85.00.  Horrible

This bike trailer seemed like a great deal. When I assembled it and tested it out it worked great, seemed very safe and comfortable. My daughter loved riding in it. Initially I was very happy with the product, especially for the price paid. Unfortunately after several weeks in the sun all of the white nylon straps - used for support and restraints - began detoriating and breaking. I would recommend spending a little more on a bike trailer that uses a better grade of materials

Received the order in a timely fashion however, the box was badly I mean badly damaged . It was a birthday gift for a family member . I always order early , mistake , returns are 30 days . We had the party 45 days later when we opened the box rust went on the carpet did you ever try to get rust out of off- white carpeting . To make things even worse it was missing all the hardware for putting it together . Probably fell out of the hole in the box that was there before they shipped it to me . HAPPY BIRTHDAY !!!!!! and your welcome for the carpet stain , all new things come rusty , you didn't know that

I was attracted to the Park & Sun PB-PRO Pitchback Pro because of the large dimensions of the tubing and the hinge assembly that would allow me to easily fold the unit and place it in my garage. The first unit I recieved arrived with the box trashed and the netting, hing pieces, and hardware missing. I promptly recieved a replacement box and it contained everything I needed to assemble the unit. 
Unfortunately, the tolerance on the nipples and flanges of the tubing pieces varies considerably. After juggling pieces around and pushing and tugging, I ended up with two pieces that should have fit with other pieces but absolutely did not fit any of the pieces. On one vertical piece the nipple was too big and would not fit into any of the flanges; on a corner piece the recieving flange was too small to recieve any of the vertical pieces. Also, the tubing is made of rolled steel tubing, and the weld is not ground off of the interior of the tubing so that virtually all of the pieces are difficult to fit together. The packaging was insufficient as several pieces came with the paint rubbed off with rust showing through due to shifting of the contents. There was rust dust on the plastic sleves covering the tubing, particularly at the tube ends. Nice idea, poor execution.

This stand deserves a 0, but that wasnt an option. The engineers that designed it were smoking something wicked. It is of poor design and quality. I wouldnt take if they were givin it away. I've had it set up in my basement for a few days and I couldnt wait to take it down and return. Which I did. Pronto. Do yourself a favor. Stay away

This stand is very bad quality. Not worth investing in this stand. The speed bag platform isnt even made out of real wood. It vibrates too much! The Swivel it comes with is made out of plastic! It Sucks! Invest in a better stand like the ones from www.balazsboxing.co

I was thrilled when I received this knife. It was cute, small, and the utilities were perfect for light duty mom-emergency situations. However, after less than a month in my purse, the floral plastic cover (which in truth I thought felt pretty flimsy when I got it) had broken off one side and was cracked on the other. Sigh..

Don't buy this.  It doesn't work.  The ink is not even at all if and when you can get it on the stamp.  I've attempted around 50 stamps (on some range balls) and not one is crisp and clear.  The stamp is either running (too much ink), or the middle letter is messed up from too little ink.

Save your money, buy a sharpie pen and mark your balls with that

My son hit .515 as an 8 year old last year.  This year, he moved up a division and has struggled at around .250, even though he has a fairly nice swing.  Using this device for two weeks, he suddenly can't hit anything.  I pitched him hardballs today and he swung over the top of every one of the first 60!  The problem with this device is that the ball doesn't drop like a pitched ball, so it actually trains them to swing higher than normal.  I'll be putting this away for the season and trying to recover my son's swing and confidence.  Don't get me wrong, the kids love it.  The entire team lines up before every game and begs you to throw fastballs with it.  It's great for use around the house - just tie it to a tree and you can take swings that you couldn't otherwise.  Beware if you intend to use this for much more than casual practice and don't let it replace live pitching.  Fun-factor is a 5, but as far as a training device, I have to question its value

The design of the bed is awesome.  Unfortunately it would not hold air.  There were no visible flaws.  The instructions state that the bed will need additonal air after the bed is originally used.  The bed would not hold air at all.  (I only attempted to use it in the house and checked for possible problems there 1st)

I purchased another bed assuming that the 1st bed had a flaw and the second one did exactly the same thing.  I love the design but I am disappointed in the quality

This was a big waste of money. The first day of use, my two guest had to pump it back up about five times throughout the night.

I thought maybe it was because two people were on it. A couple of monthe later I had another guest sleep on it. He had to do the same thing. IHe ended up sleeping on the couch. He thought it was a mre comfortable sleep anyway.

Again, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!

I didn't think it was difficult to set up but it clearly isn't designed well.  The target that hangs inside the cage doesn't actually fit.   And..... the netting doesn't stop the balls.  How's that for a good product.  1 out of 5 balls rips right through the net.  

Buy anything else

I expected much better quality from Thule. As used according to the manufacturers recomendations, this bag did not even last one trip from New York to Chicago without it's interior lining cracking and completely flaking off. In addition, the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car. The contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that's not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car. This becomes a terrible distraction while driving. All in all I had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it. Opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers, they cost much more, but are worth every penny. In the end I thought I was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a Sears X-Cargo container to replace it for my return trip back.

Placed the order on 11/20, delivery was supposed to be by 12/9. On about 12/1 I contacted the company that Amazon said was the provider, Unbeatable Sale, Inc. to verify that they did have the order. Unbeatable said that it was an Amazon order, period, and gave me a number at Amazon to contact. Amazon said that Unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first. 
Cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at Walmart.

Before purchasing this watch, you should go to a store and take a look. This watch is HUGE. The temperature feature works fine until you wear the watch, then because of your body temp. you have no idea what the temp. is. The barometer feature is displayed in millibars, not something I am acquainted with. I could not get the compass feature to work correctly.
   It took approx. 3 weeks to be delivered ( free shipping ). I returned the "watch" and purchased a TIMEX, paid for shipping, and it was at my door in 4 days and works perfectly

Don't order this item or anything from Mercantilla Inc. The product was a different color than advertised, it was missing three important parts, without which you can't use the bench, and many of the other parts were damaged. I've never had this many problems from any of Amazon's sellers. This was supposed to be my Holiday present, but it turned out to be a real disappointment.

I used one powerglove for a month and it was sporadic at working and then quit entirely.  Amazon sent a free replacement.  It did the same thing.  I couldn't get it to turn on, then after 8 minutes or so if it did turn on I couldn't get it to turn off.  It needs major redesigning.  I like the concept and it was comfortable but that's about all.  Barbara Baxte

I had great hope for this item after reading reviews, but found that it didn't function as described, and that the three buttons that control it are so close together that my fingers were unable to press them individually...and I have tiny hands.  It's a great idea, but needs a re-design before I could use it.

I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the "sticky" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor.

Basically, I ordered my racket on the 11 and got my racquet in 3 weeks! That was really long, especially because I upgraded my shippping. I dont' like this because the grip isn't really grippy (lol) and the strings make your hands hurt because they're kinda loose. The only thing I like about this is that it donates to breast cancer, but I really don't recommend this raquet. I bought an N-code right after I tried to use this 3 times. Very unsatisfied.

I went to Swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others.  This is the only pole they have which isn't saying much for the brand, but I found that the suggested retail is $4 lower to what Amazon is selling it for.  Just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price.  Even though Amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap.  Probably too cheap to be any good

I tried $50-$60 sets from Regent (who apparently also does Spalding), Franklin, and Sportcraft, and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets (alternately, one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance, including who pays Shipping costs).  Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads, inviting breakage. Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet's threads stripped when tightening by hand, and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened.  Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under, and they claimed their 2 " balls were 3" (if they were rounding, why don't they round their 3 5/16" balls as well?).   Franklin's stakes had different tapers, and about 1/16" different diameters.  On the personal preference front, Sportscraft's handles are grooved, Franklin's balls are, and their wickets are narrow.  Regent's colors are dull

When one trips the safety key, one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again. This action looses all the time and distance information. The Keys Fitness, who manufactures Ironman and a bunch of others, help line confirmed that this is normal for their products. I see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body

I was so happy to order this. It hasn't even been put together yet... in box for two weeks. They sent the wrong hardware with it. I emailed them 2 times and got no response. After twenty minutes of trying I finally got a human voice. She was nice and shipped the parts. They arrived today and guess what? The same wrong parts again. I can't get a response so I guess I will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together. At least I have a list from the owner's manual. Overall experience was a big fat bust

Don't buy this equipment unless you have two very strong people who are expert mechanics. Other exercise equipment comes partially assembled, this just has alot of odd pieces. 
Complaint: 1) No "how to assemble" video as other brand names include. 2) Instruction sketches are small and diagrams are vague. 3) It took hours of painstaking trial and error to assemble, and we ended up leaving one washer out because once assembled, it cannot be diassembled. If I had known what a giant project this would be to assemble , I would never have purchased it.  This is Tony Little product is not an assembly friendly exercise machine, which Body By Jake products usually are. How much more would it have cost them to put in a a "how to" assembly video? I'll never buy a Tony Little product again. 
That said, it's very simple to use. 
Since this is the heavy duty model, it's heavy to move, and it takes up alot of space. It's a type of exercise equipment that needs its own large space. If you have a small room, think twice about this model.

This sounds great in theory, being that you don't have to get under the car to drain the oil. Fantastic! But while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars, I don't quite agree. You still have to get under the car to change the oil filter, so I'd suggest saving $50 and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car, which is actually faster than using this device.

Poor workmanship. Padded handgrip area varied from 3.25 to 3.5" long. Most palms are wider than that. The cheap construction looks like it will fail within a short period of use.  Shipping them back would cost more than they're worth.

This mat may have a design flow, or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up. Layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll. In the process, the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat. I suppose it's still functional, but my brand new mat looks pretty awful

This is not a usable sword. This is for fans of the movie and to hang on the wall. There are very few swords that can be used, among these are Paul Chen's, Cold Steel's and the Last Legend stuff. Only buy this if you intend to put it on your wall because failure is not a possability it is guaranteed if you try to use this blade

Don't buy these cards. They are of very low quality. I bought 4 decks -- several cards in each deck where visibly marked. You will be better off paying a few dollars more for high-quality cards.

I woke up repeatedly in the night with more pain that the Plantars Faciitis was giving me for the following reasons: 
-The front part of the sock device is extremely narrow.  I don't have wide feet, but the pointy ends crowded by toes and caused cramps that I had to adjust for constantly.  Could never get used to it.

-The strap around the ankle was too stiff and chaffed.  Took forever to find the right tightness that didn't cause my feet to swell painfully in the night while not being so loose that it moved and chafed horribly.  

-Honestly, even wearing a hard plastic brace was easier for me to sleep with.

A simple strap that supported the arch and wrapped over the instep has been the most effective, along with faithfully wearing the arch supports during the day.

Don't waste your money

The Thule load bars that I actually received were only 50 inches long, and I needed the 58 inch load bars, so I really couldn't do anything with them.  It specifically said right in the title that they were the 58 inch bars, but they were not.  I even wrote amazon  back to try and right the situation, but no one contacted me, so I had to sell the bars on ebay and buy another pair that were the right length

On my third pair since I purchased these gloves from Amazon a few weeks ago. First pair had Velcro on the inside sewn into the seam. Very irritating, especially when holding heavy weights and having the rough Velcro dig into the palm of your hand. Medium size was smaller than advertised, shutting off the circulation to my fingers and the non slip pads on fingers were ripping off after 1 week of use! Harbinger customer service was very helpful, and sent me out a new, larger pair for free (had to return mine first). This pair shows up, and the gloves are two different colors! Blue and gray on one and blue and black on the other. Strike two for quality control! Waiting for a 3rd matching pair from Harbinger. Again, Harbinger customer service is excellent, but the quality control of these gloves is less than average

This fitness mat is thick and cushy, but I find myself having to make a lot of adjustments during my workout because it's about a foot too short. My biggest complaint is that the 'washable' cover (a major reason I selected this product) shrank to a completely unusable size when I washed it (in cold water, line dried). Now I'm left with just a piece of foam that is inconvenient to transport and somewhat uncomfortable

I was excited to purchase what I thought was a quality knife for a good price with good ergonomics, being a Ken Onion design.  What I bought was designed to sell and not to last.  The handle was textured on the sides, but the edges of the handle were far too smooth to be held safely, especially if they were to ever get a little wet.  The thumb studs have very sharp edges that will wear out pants quickly.  The spring-assist broke after two months of extremely mild, absolutely non-abusive use.
The $12.00 return shipping fee plus the cost to ship it to Emerson makes the true cost of the knife about $84.00...and what if the spring breaks again?  My advice is buy another brand.
P.S.  The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is the tanto blade and the fact that it can still be used as a quick-opening folder, absent the "blur."

I would not recommend this product unless you absolutely cannot afford to spend any more money. For around $60, you could get the "World Industries M.A.D. Balance Board" and get a much better looking and more durable product. Or you could spend around $80 and get a Bongo Board. If you really want the best and have the money for it, you could spend about $120 and get an Indo Board.

The Zoomboard that I received was green and blue. Unfortunately, it looks garish, but a child may like the look of this. In addition to the garish coloring scheme, the board has a rough sandy underside. This is good because it allows the board to better grip the rolling tube. However, after a couple weeks of using it (five days each week for 30 minute sessions with my 140 lbs. frame), the tube develops craters from the sand and wears down. Then again, if you wait it out, the sand eventually will slough off of the board itself and you won't have to worry about wearing down your rolling tube. But the gripping surface will be compromised.

 If you try using this on a hard floor and not carpeting, the rolling tube starts to move less fluidly than before. Make sure there are no grains, pebbles, or hard materials on the surface you are practicing on because they can easily ruin your rolling tube. This may be a failing of boards that use a wood rolling tube.

Overall, this board is fun, but not great quality. If you absolutely cannot afford $10 more to purchase a much better product, then buy this board and use it sparingly on a carpet to get a long life out of it.  If you can afford more, keep looking and check out the products that I mentioned above and get something that'll actually be worth your hard-earned money

I am surprised this bike has gotten good reviews; I am quite diappointed. I purchased this bike after looking at many mountain bikes and decided that this seemed to be a good buy. However, it turned out not to be so. First of all, the bike is really ugly with its white and brownish colors, though I suppose that's a personal issue.

As for performance, this bike is not worth its stated price of over $200, so don't think you are getting some great deal. The suspension leaves something to be desired and it seems to be shifting funny. I am not an expert on bikes, but I'm pretty sure shifting is supposed to be a little smoother than this.

Also, after about a week, I noticed a strange noise coming from the bike as I peddled. It's hard to explain... almost like something is out of place.

So again, the bike is not worth this price. Perhaps if it were being sold for around $100 it would be a decent deal

I received my Stamina Products Adjustable Hyperextension Bench on March 13th of '07 and was very disappointed. There was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box. The product was scratched and parts were broken. 

Fortunately the bench works, but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage. The product seems to be of quality, it's just unfortunate that SPS doesn't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap

I have purchased this backpack (in black) in August and I haven't actually used it until December of '06. I was carrying around 40+ pounds in this pack hiking along the apalacian trail, and on the first day, this pack ripped. My left shoulder strap ripped off at the bottom, and I had to secure it with a square knot. The next day the right shoulder strap ripped in a different place, and I had to loop the adjustable strap around a seam on the belt.

Also, I have stepped on the waist belt numerous times without thinking about it, and the flimsy peice of plastic broke. It still held, but I had to check it twice every time. I tried to pick up the handle above the straps on my fourth day hiking, and the left side of it ripped partially. 

Another thing that happened was that I was trying to put the heavy items at the bottom of the bag while hiking, and when I came home, I noticed that the bottom of the bag had some holes in it from when I leaned against a rock or ground to catch my breath. The bottom of this bag is nothing but fabric. 

This pack is nothing but a glorified backpack, not meant to hold anything more than 25-30 pounds at the most. If you want a backpack that is dependable, buy something else. If you want something cheap for a day hike or something, I suppose this pack is for you, but I'd still say that this pack is not worth it.

It's not that bad of a product, considering how cheap it is. However I have three definite criticisms. One, it isn't very stable. When your doing dips, it's pretty wobbly. Two, the pull-up bar isn't far enough away from the crossbars, so if your body swings at all during your pull-ups, it's really easy to bash your shins on the lower crossbar. And three, the push up bars are totally usless. You can not do push ups on them with out hitting your head on the lower cross bar.

At first they kept the water out of my eyes and were
comfortable. But after 3 or 4 times they had some water
leakage. I use them for recreational swimming at the
YMCA. But am already looking for another swim goggle.

I hope you post this even though I gave them a poor rating.

These provide good protection in case of falls while inline skating.
However, I've had them less than a year and the material is starting to tear and fall apart.  I am not sure how long they will last. 
I purchased   these to replace a  similar set I had for 9 years, which were worn, but not falling apart.  Now I wish I had not thown the old ones away.

The product that was delivered was defective.  The harness system was manufactured with insufficient webbing.  I contacted LaFuma and was informed that this was a recurring problem.  They sent me a mailing label to return the product free of charge and will send me a replacement in mid-April when the new model comes out.  The manufacturer was responsive; however, I was out of pocket $13.00 for a shipping box that I purchased for the mailing.  In fairness, Amazon should reimburse me for this $13.00 expense.  I did not expect to receive a defective product

The ski rack is attached to the Thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar. The old 724 had metal connectors. Making them plastic is insane. These connectors will break over time. Additionally, a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors.

It was flat after one night of sleeping.  We had to blow it up to capacity every night and would be sleeping on the ground by morning.  

Also, be aware that you need an AC outlet to pump it up ... it's NOT for camping

I loved it the first 2 months i had it.  With out notice the cable shredded.  I called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me.  It seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it.

The customer service is bad and so was the product

My husband bought this for me for Christmas after we both had looked at reviews and decided it was a great product. I used it for 5 months with no problems other than the squeaky sound everyone talks about. Then, without warning, the bolt securing the cable to the right pedal popped off. When my husband called the company, he was told that the parts (including the pedal and cable) were only guaranteed for 90 days, and the frame for 3 years. In other words, there was nothing they would do about it. When I called, they told me that they could replace the entire stepper free of charge, but I would have to pay shipping and handling. That was today, I'm still awaiting a call back from the supervisor about the s&h reimbursement. This gave me a great workout so I was disappointed to find out it was defective enough to break after 5 months of use by a 120 lb woman (and I only used it about 3x per week). I'm hoping that this was a fluke as only one other review in this set currently states the same problem... and I'm hoping the company has the decency to replace their defective product

I would have given this product one star, but I did get several months of use out of it before it literally melted down into a useless steaming pile of plastic.

After about two weeks of use, the Electronic Mini-Stepper started creaking and groaning like it could snap at any moment. As previous reviewers have noted, the thing actually starts smelling of burning oil/plastic/metal. After two months of use, the shocks on both pedals started leaking fluid. Good thing I had a nice thick plastic mat underneath it.

I owned and used the Electronic Mini-Stepper for all of four months, using it five days per week (20-25 minutes per day), before the cable secured around the pully-wheel snapped loose of its moorings. This probably occured because of the extra strain put on the cable due to decreased pressure in the defective, leaking shocks. I now own a twenty pound, forty dollar door stop.

There's no reason, other than ultra-cheap construction, that a 160 pound man should be able to destroy a piece of exercise equipment like this in four months. During this time, I used nothing but normal exercise practices: smooth, even, steady steps...nothing jarring. Buyer beware on this one

My first impression is that the unit is very rugged and nice looking.  Then I tried to use it.  I mostly bought it for the altimeter and thermometer.  In the first day of use I just ran out of patience and plan to return it.

Here's the problems I had with the Altitech2

1.	Most of the time the buttons work fine, but several times I pressed the mode button and the mode did not change.

2.	When setting Declination page 25 of the manual states that you can press SET/RESET/LIGHT to reverse the digits, but as soon as you press the SET/RESET/LIGHT button the unit ends the calibration mode.

3.	The temperature was stuck at 87.5 degrees for about an hour after purchase.  Finally after cycling through the mode buttons the temperature instantly dropped to 81.5 degrees.  I held the unit in front of the AC vent in the car until the car was cooled down to 70 degrees, I suspect the air coming out of the vent was actually cooler than 70 degrees.  The temperature display never budged from 81.5 degrees.

4.	I constructed a rudimentary chamber and placed the Altitech2 unit and a digital thermometer in the chamber.  The digital thermometer registered 78 degrees, the Altitech2 registered 81.4 degrees.  I blasted hot air in the chamber with a hair dryer.  The digital thermometer quickly rose to 116 degrees and I turned the heat off.  The Altitech2 stayed at exactly 81.4 degrees.  After removing from the chamber the Altitech2 slowly increased to 94 degrees, went down to 92.6 degrees and stayed there for a good 5 minutes.  Despite the room temperature being about 78 degrees.

5.	The compass will only stay on for 10 seconds, then the display turns off to conserve battery.  This never seems to be long enough to get a good fix while using in reference to a map.  When the display shuts down you need to press the start button again to turn on the display.  Since this button is recessed, you have to reposition your hand to press the button with your fingernail (I had to).  This moves the compass in relation to the map again and is very frustrating to have to constantly have to press the start button.  I'll stick with my 19th century compass for now.

This unit might be worth keeping for me if the Altimeter is reliable, but after all the other trouble I had I did not even mess with setting up the altimeter as I had lost confidence in the device.

The band that holds the foot came loose with the whole string after two minutes of light use, I didn't even had the chance to kick with it; I excepted better quality from Everlast; too bad
In addition, the bands that hold the chin are designed such that it is difficult to tighten this thing on your shin

I tried $50-$60 sets from Regent (who apparently also does Spalding), Franklin, and Sportcraft, and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets (alternately, one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance, including who pays Shipping costs).  Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads, inviting breakage. Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet's threads stripped when tightening by hand, and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened.  Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under, and they claimed their 2 " balls were 3" (if they were rounding, why don't they round their 3 5/16" balls as well?).   Franklin's stakes had different tapers, and about 1/16" different diameters.  On the personal preference front, Sportscraft's handles are grooved, Franklin's balls are, and their wickets are narrow.  Regent's colors are dull.  Rated 1 Star because sets tend to be priced by the size of the equipment, and this is too expensive for mislabeled 2 " balls

I bought one of the Brookstone mini-exercise bikes when it was still priced at $99.00 (on February 1, 2007), based on two positive reviews that were posted at that time.  Initially, I was impressed by the prompt delivery of the product but immediately discovered the bike was not factory assembled correctly.  Instead of a left- and right-hand crank arm, my exercise bike has two right hand crank arms.  This may seem trivial until you realize that the cranks are suppose to be threaded in opposite directions to prevent the pedals from coming unscrewed during use.  

I contacted Brookstone Customer Service to request a replacement part (I needed two right-hand pedals) the evening I received the shipment.  I had to place follow-up calls each week for six weeks until finally receiving the replacement pedal.  When, at one point, I mentioned simply returning the exercise bike, the customer service rep. indicated that approval would be needed from higher up the food chain because--as I waited for the new part--I'd had the bike in my possession past the 30-day return policy!

With the new pedal finally in place, I immediately tried out the bike and was disappointed (though, unfortunately, not surprised) that the overall construction feels very flimsy under foot.  The mini-bike is quite noisy and so far, I've found no floor surface that keeps it reliably stable during use--either on a rug or on linoleum.  As a result, I have to back it up against a desk, file cabinet, or bookcase to use.

This product has been a huge disappointment and I would strongly encourage people interested in purchasing a small exercise bike to please not waste their money--even at the reduced price--on this product.

I was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much, I thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything. But when I tried it I discovered 2 things. First off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place (which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one). And when I finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it's on it only burns about a calorie a minute. 

This bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance (though I only tried it for a few minutes) but definitely not for your legs

I ordered this product for more than what its new price is on December 21, 2006 as a Christmas present for my mother. It didn't arrive until January 9th, and it arrived damaged!  We sent it back for a refund.  On February 2nd, this low-rate item arrived at our doorstep again, AFTER I checked several times by phone to make sure that my order was marked as a RETURN and not an EXCHANGE.  We decided to set it up and see if this one was better.  STILL DAMAGED in another area. I have called The Sharper Image over ten times now over a span of 2 months. I know their customer service number by heart, and I even know their direct customer service number (without having to go through the machine) by heart (call 1-888-344-5555 instead of 1-800...). Their shipment is slow and their processing is painfully slow! They've given me 3 different order numbers without telling me, so I couldn't get accurate information about my order online.  Beware of dealing with this company.  If you can, go into a Sharper Image store somewhere, take the thing out of its box to examine it, and only then consider bringing this product into your house.  One good thing is that they do give you a full refund, tax included.  At least that's what they told me by phone today.  By the way, this should be called a Foldaway Strider, not Elliptical.  It absolutely does not have the elliptical wheel or power that other more functional elliptical machines do

I am a personal trainer and I was asked by a friend to check this "elliptical" strider out for them.  I was suspicious from the price thinking that it really couldn't be an elliptical machine but checked it out anyway.  
As I suspected, this is simply a glider similar to what was on infomercials years ago. Except for the Tony Little TV glider most of those 20 or more gliders that were on the market are all gone. There is a simple reason that true elliptical machines are so popular in health clubs and that there are NO gliders in health clubs. With ellipticals and treadmills users lift their legs with each stride which of course is more like the natural motion of walking and running.  This of course engages many more muscles than the gliding or swinging machines of the past. Also ellipticals have a flywheel to allow the user to add resistance while still keeping a smooth motion. 
I've read the other reviews of this machine and realize that certainly any movement is better compared to doing nothing.  But it is a question of time.  You could swing on one of these machines for hours and while it might be kind of fun for some people it will never come close to a true elliptical.  I'm not promoting any one brand and I have no ax to grind, except that it is somewhat annoying when companies like Sharper Image continue to intentionally mislead the public because they know it sells products. The reason elliptical machines are called "elliptical" is that the user's foot goes through an elliptical path.  Gliders just swing back and forth like a pendulum.  If you don't believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist.  This is misleading marketing and no doubt they know they are using that name to cash in on the popularity of the real ellipticals.  My advice to my friend was to save a little more money and get an elliptical.

At first I was very happy with this stroller. I love the big wheels, the front one which swivels. The cup holders are convenient for both parent and baby. And the adjustable handle is awesome because I'm short and I can push the stroller at a comfortable height. Also it maneuvers very easily up and down curbs, steers easily even with one hand everywhere from the mall, museum, park, or on city streets. 

One of the biggest drawbacks for me has been the reclining seat back. There is a drawstring that you must adjust. This requires two hands and can be difficult at times if the child is fussy or uncooperative. Despite this, I still loved the stroller until recently.

However, after only two months of use, my stroller will not lock. It has actually folded up on my son while pushing it. I now cannot even seem to lock it into the open position for use. I have not found any levers to snap in place to hold it open. And because the stroller folds outward, not inwards like an umbrella stroller, it actually pulls the childs body backwards when the locks give out. This is very dangerous. I am contacting the manufacturer about this defect

I have a small head and this was way too tight for me.  It pulled my hair and left me with a headache.  Plus it has a strong chemical smell that didn't go away after wearing in the pool. I tried it 3 times, thinking it might get better, but gave up and threw away. Spend a little more and get the fabric or silcon style instead

After unpacking and assembling the Ab Chair Deluxe, I noticed it was cheaply constructed with poor quality fastners and metal components even at the price point sold. The digital read out display lite up all 8's and blanked regagardless of the written direction input or new batteries. Every black end cap except two have fallen off due to poor fit. I still use it extensively because the principal of crunching and stretching the abdominals is very effective. Get a ab chair, just NOT this one

I wish I could write a review of this product, unfortunately I cannot because the vendor (Verdent) is dishonest. You see Amazon requires all outside vendors to ship all orders within two business days. Verdent Gifts thought they could just sidestep this little detail, not ship my order for 9 days and feed me a line of BS on top of that. Yes, I called the vendor and he told me quote " we are having a difficult time getting UPS to pick up our orders", what a crock unless you are't paying your UPS shipping bills.
Anyway, to make a long story short, Amazon did try to help and is refunding my money after they tried to get Verdent gifts to make the refund, Verdent refused, so Amazon is picking up the tab...and hopefully giving the boot to Verdent Gifts in the process. Avoid a headache and hassle, steer clear of these bums (Verdent Gifts) and thier dishonest practices

I bought the chair for my mother. She really wanted the chair so that she can start working out on it. She loved it. It looks very nice, the size is alot bigger than what I thought it would be, which is a good thing. The only problem I have is that every time she uses it, one of the screws comes out and the arm comes loose. She is very disappointed with that because she's afraid to use it now. I'm not sure what can be done to rectify this problem, but it something that needs to be taken care of. Aside from that, It took a very long time for the item to come in and I'm very upset with the fact that we had to wait so long to receive it, and now she can't really even use it!

Ab Lounge seems to be made of quality materials excluding sauna Belt(import junk). Direction manual is almost useless, does not tell where certain parts go or how they are to be used. You will need to look at TV commercials,and possibly take a trip to your sports store to get an idea how this thing goes together. Their web site is no help

I don't think I have ever run across a more overpriced, flimsy piece of camping gear; and for this very poorly engineered and built table to actually come from Coleman was rather a shock.  The first time I opened the box containing this table was while setting up the camp site.  Too late: the table was so delicate that the main parts that hold it together -- the leg anchors that support the equally flimsy and fragile aluminum cross pieces -- had been broken in the simple act of shipping.  I looked closer, and these main supports were made of some incredibly cheap, delicate plastic.  This thing wouldn't have lasted a day on a campsite, even if it had survived shipping!  (We placed the table in the campsite's trash dumper the next morning). Buy a lower cost table from another company -- no need to even go to a higher priced unit, since anything else would be better designed and constructed than this table.

Continuing their recent trend of crisp-looking cards with nice borders and wonderful sub and chase sets, Topps has done very well with their 2006 line-up of cards.  The basic card design doesn't stray too far from their tried-and-true formula of having complete MLB stats for each player and a brief insightful look at each player.  These insights include quotes from players, teammates, stats from a particular time in the player's career, nickname origins, etc.  This is one thing that always set Topps apart from the pack.  

The front design includes action shots of each player trimmed in a border that somewhat coincides with each team's colors.  The player's and team's name are trimmed in silver.  The back of the cards have the aforementioned stats and a nifty cartoon in the upper-right hand corner with another brief insight into the player featured on the card.

With the collapse of Fleer, MLB has begun working with Topps and Upper Deck in an attempt to draw collectors back to hobby of collecting and trading baseball cards according to Athlon Sports' Baseball Preview.  One aspect of this joint venture is the distinguishing rookie card logo found on all rookie cards this season.  It will be used to remove any doubt on collectors' part as to which card is the "authentic" rookie card of each player.  You'll find cards with that logo in this set from Topps.

Another fine addtion to this set is the Mantle/Bonds homerun cards.  With the scandal surrounding Bonds these days, his cards may not be worth hunting, but Mantle's cards are a wonderful find when you open a pack.  

Topps has also thrown in a few autographs and relics as usual, but the real doozies here will be the "autographs" of all-stars such as John Adams and Benjamin Franklin.  Topps has inserted cards in their set this season featuring the actual signatures of each of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.  I haven't been lucky enough to snag one of them yet, but the basic Declaration cards are a nice addition to the set.

With historic sigs and Mantle cards, Topps has proven that nothing is more American than baseball, Chevrolet and apple pie.

A nice set to get

I have been using a Polar s610 for some time.  When everything is working it is a wonderful device.  However, it is difficult to keep it running smoothly.  For example, when I upgrade to a new computer I go through hell getting the software to work again.  Polar customer service is useless.  Most recently I have been unable to upload data from the monitor to my PC via USB for months.  I do not believe I will be able cure the problem without PURCHASING new software +  the software dose NOT include the USB connection software.  That is sold seperately.  Polar will not provide replacement software unless you purchase it on CD.  The rest of the world will provide software and upgrades to registered users online.  

Bottom Line - the product is pretty good.  However in terms of user friendly Polar is a total failure.

Highhgear is supposed to be in the outdoor and active gear business, which one would assume involves some knowledge about how outdoor and active gear works.  

So what do they do with this item?  They sell it with a ferrous metal split ring on the compass -- so that the thing will never point to north correctly as long as that ring is attached to the compass.  (This leads to the problem noted by an earlier reviewer.)

I bought this model to replace a previous version (no clock) -- the battery had run down and there was no way to replace it.  Which brings up another point:  Why an alkaline battery instead of lithium.  Dumb.  But even more strange is that the earlier version had non-ferrous split rings and the compass worked fine -- so Highgear is not even maintaining the QC they had a year or two ago.

Also, at least one of the buttons on my sample is pretty dodgy.  S1 - by which you set time, date, etc. -- does not work well.  Sometims it ignores input, and other times it registers two hits with one press.

All together, this product is the result of very poor design and manufacturing specifications, and/or very poor quality control.  

Please don't expect to much functionality from this product

i cant say anything for the other things, but the compass does not work at all.  North is always changing and if you move it to see if north will remain the same, north does does not.    i was looking for a simple, compass keychain.  this is small and a keychain, but a compass that works it is not.

No where does Amazon say in their description, that this comes completely disassembled!  I have purchased other exercise equipment and you usually have to put on a handle bar or stabilizer.  So here it sits in it's box like a big paper weight in the middle of my floor.  Amazon is not paying for return shipping and I can not afford to spend half the amount of the purchase to return it.  Buy your big purchases from someone who has a unconditional paid return policy.  This may be a good machine, but I will never find out.

When the scope arrived, it came slightly cracked on the end you look through, which wasn't a good start. Then, when i looked through, there was no magnification, just small red crosshairs. If you are looking for a functioning scope, DO NOT BUY THIS SCOPE. But if ur looking to decorate your gun, then this looks pretty cool on it

 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.

This product is ineffective. 

The snorkel gets stuck, either open so that water pours in while you're trying to breathe, or stuck shut so you cannot take a breath of air while under water. It's is very distressing when you're out in deep water snorkelling and the breathing tube fails to perform! I often take in mouthfuls of water, or worse; suck for a breath of air and get nothing! It is therefore useless, I stopped using the tube as it is more trouble than good.

I bought two sets, one for my partner and one for myself, and they both fail to perform. The mask on one set broke after 2 months (the metal pin became dislodged) and the tightening clips on the flippers frequently fall off while trying to tighten them to your feet. The bag's zippers rusted not long after use... given that most people snorkel in salt water, you think they would have considered rust proofing the metal. 

Overall the quality of these not-so-cheap kits are embarrassingly bad. We both felt awkward snorkeling with them, and sometimes I even felt they were hazardous. 

We tossed these products and bought Cressi brand gear. It has changed our underwater experience

I wanted a high quality yoga mat that was long in length because I am a tall person.  I thought I had picked the perfect mat when I ordered this one.  I didn't have a problem with the length (although it smelled that new plastic stench) but I did have a problem with the weight.  This mat is HEAVY!  I knew it would be HEAVY when I purchased it and being a person in somewhat good shape I didn't think I would mind it but I didn't realize that it would be cumbersome.  The last straw that made me want to return it was when I was in a yoga class; sweating and I began to slip on the mat.  If I am going to spend this amount of money on a yoga mat I don't want any problems.  To Amazon's credit I was able to return it and they paid for postage.  If I would have had to pay for the return postage myself it would have cost a lot because of how HEAVY it is but I would have paid it anyway (that should tell you how much I didn't like it).  I am now looking for a long mat but lighter and toxic free.  I want something that will be biodegradable.  The problem now is there are so many mats available (too many choices can be just as frustrating as too few).

I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the "sticky" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor.

bought this machine, based on the reviews on Amazon. It was okay at first. I workout regularly with tapes, outdoors activities and started using the machine twice a week. By the 3rd week it started to make noises as if the wheel was rubbing against the plastic cover of the chain. We tried to see if we can fix it, but it didn't work. I can't use it anymore, mainly because the wheel is not rotating properly and rubber/plastic is rubbing against each other somewhere. You get what you paid for!!! Now I'm looking to invest in something more sturdy. If you exercise once every month this is the machine for you!

This was a horrible product, it was difficult to manuever and control. It did nothing but immediately cause my arms, shoulders and wrists to hurt. I felt absolutely nothing at all in the target area, my stomach. Not even a little. It was boring and pointless to bother.This machine was a waste of time to ship back and forth and I do not recomend it to anyone who wants to work their stomach muscles. Its a misleading product and very uncomfortable on the back also. It hurt my spine to bend in the way they said. I felt the machine digging into my spine. I was so focused on the pain and the pain in my arms I could not continue for more than 5 minutes at a time. Dont waste your time buying this product. Its expensive and not worth it.

This is another fly by night workout machine that looks great in the pictures and on videos but when you take it out of the box, you realize that it is poorly and cheaply constructed. I own a ton of excerise equipment and this is the only piece of equipment I have had to return...I have purchased so much on the internet this past year and have been very happy with all of my products. That is until I purchased this Ab-Doer which was a TOTAL waste of time and money. 

The tension on the arms of the unit is way too flimsy and loose...The foam around the arms is also very cheap foam in fact my daughter used it "once" and there was already a small chunk of foam that came off the unit...She does not even have long nails...The bars that connect the seat to the bottom of the unit stay in place ok when your on it, but they do not lock in the base when your not on it so if you pick-up the unit to move it, it collapses... 

What's really bad is the so called back massager that is located on the main area of the center stem. It does nothing but hurt your back and is worthless...Even adjusting the bar for different heights is a joke...It's a screw, not a quick disconnect... 

This is one of those products that make a ton of money by mass advertising but will quickly fad out fast unless there are MAJOR changes done to this unit...It's sad when you watch some of those excercise info-mercials that have all these people with great bodies that may be fooling you into believing that the products really work...

I couldn't find any reviews on these until now...I will never again buy a product without reading reviews from the customer themselves. We are the best source of honesty on the market...Save your money or just do some sit-ups and leg raises if you can...They work SOOOOO MUCH BETTER than this product !!! 

If you do some searching, you will see some of the BAD reviews about this product that are coming in...Based on Amazon's review rules, I cannot list where I read them from...

Have a Great day everyone !!!

I bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning. I had to order another inner tube. Then on the third day of trying to use this stroller, the front wheel completely bent. What a piece of garbage. I only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all I was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb. The other thing I didn't like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang/put a diaper bag. I sent this stroller back and bought a MacLaren double stroller

This is my third heart rate monitor. I purchased this one because the battery died in my last HR watch. I thought I could replace the battery, but when I tried to replace it, I broke it. Oh well. . . 

Anyway, I purchased the Reebok Fitness HR Watch because it was on sale (50% off retail). I couldn't find any reviews on it so I "rolled the dice." 

With my two previous HR watches, it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions. With the Reebok HR watch, I had to read the instructions a couple of times. After a couple of training sessions, I began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings. 

There are a few PROS on the Reebok HR watch: 

(1) The chest heart rate strap will work with Precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors.

(2) The chest heart rate strap's battery is easily replaced. (I don't know about the watch.) 

(3) It has a lot of features that you'll find in higher priced HR watches. 

Now, the CONS: 

(1) The heart rate reading is much too small if you're near-sighted or need reading glasses. 

(2) The shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it's difficult to read the small heart rate reading. 

In conclusion, because the heart rate reading is too small and there's a glare, I can't read the watch unless I slow down, steady my arm, and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare. Because of this, I'm disappointed with this watch. 

If you've got good eyesight, you can add 1-star

The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it

I went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers.  I really didn't know which one to buy so I bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so I thought it was better somehow.  Even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging, it doesn't actually display it.  It only uses it to calculate the distance that you've walked.  I was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked.  I got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket.  I'm just going to buy another pedometer.  One that displays the steps walked and has a cover

The idea behind this propane stove and grill is fantastic. You have a regular burner, and a small grill at the same time. The execution, however, leaves a lot to be desired.

Fit and finish in this product are extremely poor. Out of the box, paint was flaking, and various pieces required adjustments with pliers just to make them fit. The igniter mechanism on my unit worked very well for the grill part but very badly for the burner part.

The grill plate is aluminum with some kind of coating that already had scratches when I received the unit.

Reading other reviews I can't help but wonder if there are two different grills sold under the same stock keeping unit number: the bad kind and the good kind. If so unfortunately mine is of the bad variety.

I had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months! I live on a sailboat and I used it every day; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience. The burner did not simmer well (the flame kept creeping back up) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died. It seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly. I called Century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be. Hmmmm. I did not think it would last long but I liked it so much that when it died I tried out another one. This one was immediately defective and I took it back. Neither Century nor Coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more. Camp Chef may be a better, though much more expensive, choice for a person who does a lot of camping

It is unfortunate to have to write such a review, but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that I am compelled to do so. The unit was received new, but the hinges were already rusted, the closure hasp broken (poorly designed and executed), the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp. Made in China, this stove demonstrates no attention to detail, quality control or materials.  I own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory, much less, off the design table.  Further, the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor, if not downright unacceptable (in major ways).  As this unit was new in the box, I can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the US manufacturer has for customers. Save yourself cut hands and returns, buy another brand

Beware!!! These balls are extremely hard.  They are like hitting bricks.  I bought them because of the name, Penn. I bought a new ball machine and bought two buckets of Penn pressureless balls.  After 30 minutes of play they broke my racket, my hand hurt and my arm hurt.  I am now trying to return these bricks, I mean balls to SwingSomeWhere.  I'll let you know how it goes

The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it

... and buy a GPS instead. I agree with previous reviewer (Dave57), I WOULD NEVER BUY A SUUNTO AGAIN. Worst than Dave, I simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my Vector was full of water, couldn't even tell the time. I send it to Suunto Finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and "kindly" offered a repair for 140 Euros.

I had a Suunto for 10 months. The face scratched VERY easily which was disappointing. However the worst thing is after swimming in a pool that I could stand up in the watch FILLED with water and died. On returning to Suunto they refused to fix it under warrantee because swimming is not covered ! They say the forces created by swimming are to much for this watch and it was never designed for this purpose, despite the sales literature saying it is water proof to 100m. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER SUUNTO PRODUCT. Whatsmore the shop I bought it from say they have lots returned for the same reason and non of them were fixed under warranty either. It is also very difficult to use and you cannot hear the alarm at all

I bought this for my 8 year old to practice hitting. Although well built, it is poorly designed. The place where the Hit a Way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs. The cables on the Hit a Way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the 2nd hit. You might get one or two hits in before it is unusable. A GIANT waste of money. The only reason I give it 2 stars is the construction is solid

I recently purchased a Bean round zafu and I find it didnt live up to the claims in the least.

This zafu came shipped to me with over a pound less filling than advertised (wich wouldnt matter if the cover wasnt made so big to hold much more hulls than it came with). First thing I thought after pulling this cushion out of the box was; this thing seems nothing like the pictures. It's saggy and about half the height of all the images I've seen of it. Not to mention once you sit on it you feel all the hulls displace to give you only about 2 inches or less of lift (I weigh about 160 pounds so I dont think that weight is the problem). I'm very dissapointed in this product.

The reason I bought this was not only for the reasonable price but I thought Bean seemed like a quality company. I payed $40 for this wich does seem reasonable. It does "SEEM" reasonable. That is till you tack on the extra 11 or 12 bucks for a pound of organic hulls to fill it to the level it was advertised at.

I bought this Product from The Comfort Store. Their probably the only internet company; along with Bean of course, I will never buy from again. Unless I learn more forgiveness meditating on my rolled up towel waiting for my extra hulls

I was thrilled to find that a reasonably priced rechargeable bike light exists. I avoid throw away battery items like some avoid taxes. We have too much toxic stuff in our landfills already an I refuse to add to the this insanity. However, to my great disappointment, the internal workings of the light seem to burn out before ever recharging properly and before the the green light goes on to indicate a full charge. Then the light ceases to function at all. Amazon was great in sending a replacement TWO times, yet the same problem persisted. I checked with BELL too to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong and I wasn't. This light is a great idea, albeit with some definate glitches that need to be worked out by Bell. The two stars are for the great idea

Really, folks, spend the money on a gym membership, go outside and play with your dog, play soccer with your kids, or spend time in the afternoons working in the yard or the house after warming up with slow movements and a power walk.  Be reasonable.  Just remain aware of how your body feels, know your limits (i.e. knees, back, elbows) and don't over do it!  It takes time to find your own approach to weight/figure management.  You can do it your own way.  You don't need this thing AT ALL.    

This product will NOT bring you any satisfaction.  you'll only feel stupid for getting sucked into the infomercial and wasting time when you could've been watching Saturday morning cartoons!!!

In the infomercial it shows you "all the machines" you have to use at the gym.  Well, there's a reason people use them- becuase their tried and true.  Those machines, well worth the cost of a membership, guide the user in producing precision movements.  THey cost thousands of dollars and are built to be absolutely sturdy.  You're better off using machines at the gym(hey, don't forget the YMCA), varying your cardio between outdoor and indoor exercise, and throwing in consistant measures of Pilates and Yoga, if you want to "change your body."

This is just another stupid product, we've seen them come and go for years.  It won't be around long, folks...

Disappoint will occur, and the probabilty that injury will occur is well within the realm of possibility.

The Sportline 353 Talking Pedometer works ok as a pedometer and as an FM radio, but it has 2 issues.

The Good: The talking part of this pedometer can be turned off or on. It is nice to hear when you are rolling along, "9000 steps." The FM radio is very elementary, but functional. There is no dial to tune. You push a button and it rolls to the next station. There is a volume control on the earphones. The pedometer uses AAA batteries that can be purchased anywhere.  

The Bad: The pedometer was constantly slipping off my waistband and bouncing on the floor. It didn't break, but it was very annoying. Several times it popped off w/o me knowing and I left it in a restaurant or in a friend's car. 

The Ugly: If I accidentally bumped the reset button  - on the kitchen counter or on the arm of a chair - the pedometer lost the day's count and went back to zero. The pedometer does not have a memory feature - so the tally is lost. This would sometimes happen 2-3 times a day. Very frustrating. 

The clip broke after about 3 months -- so I retired it. 

I bought a Omron HJ112 Premium Pedometer and have been very pleased with it. It has a teather so if the clip slips off my waistband, the pedometer dangles -- it does not bounce on the floor. It has a 7-day memory feature and automatically resets at midnight. It has a clock. It uses a button battery. It does not have a radio and it doesn't talk, but it works and works well. 

The Sportline would be good if it had a teather, a clip that didn't break so easily, and a reset button that could not be pushed accidentally.

I emailed Skycaddie "contact us" the day after I bought a SG4 to ask for help. 

I have received no response in 3 weeks.

I played today with it for the first time. 

A guy I was playing with today also had a SG4. 

Neither of us could get a distance reading despite the indicator saying we had a strong GPS signal. 

All we got was "999" or complete blanks.

He has played with it four times and said it worked ok twice and didn't work twice.

It looks GREAT on TV. It is a real pity that my unit didn't work today.

I plan on returning it this week

I have had two of these units (SG2 and an SG4) and all I can say is "don't believe the hype".  While the units are an unbelievable concept on TV and work (NOTE: WHEN THEY WORK) great, the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by Skygolf is, by itself, sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena.

Just to relay my experience (and keep in mind I have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set-up these units), it took almost six hours on the phone to set-up my original SG2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software (ie-endless restarts).

When the SG2 was stolen at an event, I purchased an SG4 to obtain the next generation of the product.  Since the January 2, 2007, purchase date, I have been on the phone with no less than eight customer service representatives for a total amount of time approaching ten hours (including one Saturday morning, prior to a Sunday event, when they requested I attend a conference call regarding my unit at 5AM (NO, that is not a typing error on my part!) California time).  I have purchased/received (Skygolf sent me one unit from their headquarters out of desperation) and returned three SG4s at various points in the process to ensure that the units were not damaged.  I have attempted to download the software and access the website via the SG4 on five different computers and EVERY SINGLE SERVICE PACK OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000.  Even after I forwarded Skygolf the computer log to show them the problem (software error) neither the software developers nor the customer service department could figure out what was wrong and the units were never operational.

At this point, all I can say is what a complete and utter waste of time this process has been and how frustrating (to echo another review) it is to deal with the people behind the product.

No product, no matter how fabulous in concept, is worth this level of incompetence during set-up and operation.

Good luck to you if you purchase the product.  I hope your experience is better than mine.

All this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres.  I can't think of anything else I have ever bought that was as completely useless as this. It is a toy, pretending to be an air pump.  The nonfunctional lever on the top (mentioned by other reviewers) indicates that it was designed as a toy.  I'm just happy I was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway, not out on a trail.  In the past, I have bought a number of Bell products, including motorcycle helmets.  I now shudder to think what might have happened if I had put one of them to the test

IT is amazing to me how something like this could even be approved for the market - This pump is 100% JUNK.  SO Bad, that I am finding my self actually writing a review about a bicycle pump.  The instructions were a disaster.... and why would I need to look at instructions for a pump? - Well, that is because it does not work, and I mean does not work at all!  The lever on the side is a total gimmick (does nothing as the previous review states).  Save your money here - Do NOT buy this pump.

I carried this pump on my bike because is small, light and looks good.  But when I had a flat the pump was usless and left me stranded on the highway. This is one of several Bell products I've been dissatisfied with

I got this because it was cheap, but since it doesn't work and I have to get another, I didn't really save any money.  The lever on top that looks like the lever on other hand pumps actually does nothing.  It's completely fake: nothing inside moves when you move it, and it certainly does not help grab on to the valve. It's just something you can play with while you're waiting for someone with a decent pump to come help you.  I did just manage to get air into a fully inflated tire.  With a flat tire, I couldn't keep a solid enough contact with the valve to get air in.

During the time I was considering buying this model, I happen to see the same thing at a local department store; so I bought it. I couldn't wait to take it back.
I wasn't impressed with the cheap plastic. The pump came with the adapter pre set for a Schrader valve; my tires are Presta. The blister pack says it can be used for both and indicates all one has to do is to take off the "round end", remove and reverse the plastic adapter, re insert and then screw on the cap [tight as per the label]. Seemed simple enough, so, I took off the cap, took out the plastic insert [I noticed it is in 2 parts], reversed and re inserted and then replaced the cap. When I put the end on the Presta valve and then pressed down on the "thumb part", I couldn't help but notice that the plastic would not grab the valve, but was loose. So I decided to change back to the Schrader type [and use my adapter valve]; maybe this would be a tighter fit. So, I took off the cap, and tried to remove the insert, but only one part of it came out; the parts separated; I could not remove the "bottom" half. I was not going to force it out. I put the parts back together, re inserted them into the blister pack and returned it. No thanks !!!
I gave this product 1 star only because of the way this review process is set up; it doesn't deserve any star or any consideration for purchase

Scary looking but inpractical.  The wooden handle it too thick unless you already have extra large hands already (if your fists are that big you don't need claws).  The talon shaped blades are sharp but can't dig in, they can only scratch.  They even have a hard time cutting through multiple layers of cardboard.  Nice wall decor but nothing more

Two Amazon's statements about this product were absolutely misleading:

1. "Usually ships in 24 hours". It actually took 1 week to ship it.

2. When I finally received the package it turned out that the watch didn't have "leather band". The band was made of artificial materials (nylon and rubber) or something like that.

I will have to return it

I have had two of these units (SG2 and an SG4) and all I can say is "don't believe the hype".  While the units are an unbelievable concept on TV and work (NOTE: WHEN THEY WORK) great, the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by Skygolf is, by itself, sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena.

Just to relay my experience (and keep in mind I have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set-up these units), it took almost six hours on the phone to set-up my original SG2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software (ie-endless restarts).

When the SG2 was stolen at an event, I purchased an SG4 to obtain the next generation of the product.  Since the January 2, 2007, purchase date, I have been on the phone with no less than eight customer service representatives for a total amount of time approaching ten hours (including one Saturday morning, prior to a Sunday event, when they requested I attend a conference call regarding my unit at 5AM (NO, that is not a typing error on my part!) California time).  I have purchased/received (Skygolf sent me one unit from their headquarters out of desperation) and returned three SG4s at various points in the process to ensure that the units were not damaged.  I have attempted to download the software and access the website via the SG4 on five different computers and EVERY SINGLE SERVICE PACK OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000.  Even after I forwarded Skygolf the computer log to show them the problem (software error) neither the software developers nor the customer service department could figure out what was wrong and the units were never operational.

At this point, all I can say is what a complete and utter waste of time this process has been and how frustrating (to echo another review) it is to deal with the people behind the product.

No product, no matter how fabulous in concept, is worth this level of incompetence during set-up and operation.

Good luck to you if you purchase the product.  I hope your experience is better than mine.

It's not very accurate because the sleep function sometimes takes some time to wake up.  But what was worse was that after I owned it for two weeks, the thing stopped working!  It was never dropped or damaged in anyway, it just stopped.  The display just faded away and wouldn't work again even with a new battery.  This one was such a waste of money, I'll definately buy a different brand next time

I have used pedometers for a few years. I was initially impressed with this pedometer BUT then I discovered the 360 I received did not always 'wake' and keep track of steps. The 360 I received did not always count steps even when already 'awake.' The 'sleep' 'wake' feature is bogus, it does not work and it makes this pedometer a loser. I would not be surprised if other users of this pedometer have simply overlooked the fact that their steps might not be getting counted because the pedometer is stuck in sleep. Heartrate Monitors, the company I bought it from was not responsive when I asked for guidance. I bought another pedometer from a different dealer, the Sportline 345 - It's my second 345, need I say more

I walk pretty much the same distance daily, and this device gave me wildly different readings for the same route. I could see being off by even 100 steps for variations in stride, etc. But off by thousands of steps? Hardly worth it

Initially a very good buy, however after only 3 days of very light use I had an internal piston head on one of the guns break while the gun was resting on a desk.... and I was in another room.  For the look and price its a good buy but you get what you pay for in this case

Im new to airsoft and wanted a couple pistols to screw around with friends with, and found these.  i probably just expected too much out of them, being about $8 a gun you shouldnt expect too much.  Well, me and a friend began shooting at each other, and the BBs curved largely to the left.  Not just a little, but one of them made a near diagonal line to the left.  They're really light (although expected with cheap guns) and have a really clumsy feel.  They at least look kind of neat, and the plastic orange tip is mainly hidden by that attached compensator (looks only).  I later bought a $30 gun at meijer and it shoots nearly twice as far, and shoots straight.  These are just useful if you have too many people and not enough guns.  Dont expect to win with these, unless you're fighting other people with the same thing.  And on another note, my friend pushed down the magazine release and it snapped off.  He wasnt pressing hard, it was just weak defective plastic.

**********UPDATE - THE OLD REVIEW (see below) WAS FOR DIXIEKIP.  THE ONLY REASON IT'S STILL TWO STARS IS BECAUSE I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE IT. OLD VEGAS CHIPS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT HELPFUL IN THIS MATTER EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T ACTUALLY ORDER THE CARDS FROM THEM.  I WOULD ORDER FROM THEM ANY DAY OF THE WEEK NOW JUST BASED ON THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IN AN ISSUE THAT WASN'T EVEN THEIRS.   MY APOLOGIES TO OLD VEGAS CHIPS IN THIS MATTER.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM AND IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO CHANGE THE STARS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THESE CARDS, GO WITH OLD VEGAS CHIPS, NOT SOME OTHER DEALER!!!! - JIM ******************

I ordered these particular plastic cards because in my opinion, they are much cooler than the paisley ones that are also offered.  I immediately ordered them, yet when my package arrived yesterday (in a timely manner, I will give them that) I opened to find the ugly paisley cards looking me in the face.  I have not yet contacted the seller to see what options I have, but this is going to leave me either two options, 1) return them and wait longer for them or 2)suck it up and get stuck with the ugly cards.  I will repost once I have spoken to them

The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it

The gloves looked great online but in actually, the quality of the product was not what I imagined.  The gloves lacked padding on the inner hand and palm.  Instead, it had a thin sheet of nylon.  The closure was not secure enough so I was able to slip my hand out even with it fastened on.  On the bright side, the gloves were pretty and I had no problems returning the product back to Amazon.com

The leather/pleather outting of the glove is soo thin that if you plan on doing any sparring plan on it tearing.  I used them once and tearing occured during padwork and sparring.  I would recomend getting a glove with a thick leather so you know that it will last through the beatings

I am quite dissatisfied with the quality of the new Leatherman tools.  I purchased two Leatherman Squirt S4's and the Leatherman Micra from Amazon recently and was surprised to see that all of them arrived scratched up(like it was used before).  Some scratches were wide and deep enough to cause cuts on your hands when you use the tool.  I purchased the Leatherman Charge XTi from another vendor, which was also not of high quality that Leatherman was once known for.  I have owned the original Leatherman Wave since it first came out and have had no problems with it.  It seems like the newer models are being mass produced without some type of quality control.  Or maybe someone is repackaging used Leatherman tools and selling them as new...
I will not be buying anymore Leatherman tools until they start making high quality multitools as they were once known for.
If you want to buy one of these, either for yourself or as a gift, I would suggest you go to a store and look at it before you buy.  Make sure there are no scratches or smeared letterings or any other problems...The ones I recieved were definitely not good enough to give as gifts

I regret buying this gun. It broke within four days of buying it. We did just enough shooting to adjust the hop-up(for accuracy), and it fired great. It was really accurate. The gun was made of really cheap plastic, and the trigger stopped working. Right now, we're waiting for a RMA on it. I would recommend paying a little extra, to buy a more durable gun. I bought another gun that cost $55, and that one is made of much better plastic and feels much more durable

I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.

The specs on the bag stated that there were mesh panels for drainage and ventilation.  Well if there any, I sure couldn't find them.  Not a good quality in a bag used to place wet equipment.  The bag also has an awful smell that will hopefully dissipate over time.  I'm very sorry that I purchased this bag

Bought mine sometime around Christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to St Thomas last week.  It died within 10 minutes of being in the water.  It was never more than 5' down while I was snorkeling.
While I never tested the compass or thermometer against known "accurate" ones, it seemed to work well enough for my purposes.  Just keep it dry

Overall, not terribly happy with this units user interface and design.  The spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as "SW1" SW2" etc, but they are not labeled as such on the device.  You toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are ("TR" "CH" what??) Just an unfreindly interface all around. Look for a better unit.

Don't buy this compass if you need to know any direction. If you know about where the sun sets, you will be more accurate than this "compass." It is impossible to use in the field. A waste of money: inaccurate to the max, impossible to maintain it level, etc. Just junk. They should give them away

Had to return the first one due to non-functioning thermo and fault compass. Small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack, but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed. I also have a Brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer. We'll see how long the 2nd one lasts

One of the handles would not go in, the digital unit did not work and had no instructions on how to work it and when I would use the unit the little keeper ring on the side would cut into the side of the housing and cause some drag or friction. They told me to send it back for a replacement and I'm STILL WAITING and WAITING!!!  So I Would rate this unit a  -0-  How do I get my monies back???

I ordered this gun because it was such a great deal. When it arrived, i took it out of the box and the barrel was cracked (a big crack), nothing a little gorrila glue can't fix though. Also the accuracy isn't consistent, it is always about 4 or 5 inches off from about 20-30 feet. I had to put the back part of the laser off the sliding mechanism to get it to be accurate, otherwise it was 3 feet high. The pellet also starts to curve after 15 feet or so too. So this gun was a good deal but isn't the best quality gun i've had. You have to load it from the top of the gun, which means taking off the laser, putting in the bbs, and putting on the laser again. The magazine doesn't even come off! It still has decent speed, and isn't crap (it's just bad). It was worth 15 bucks though

The only thing on this that works well is the watch...   the altimeter, thermometer and compass even after being calibrated give incorrect readings...   the stopwatch is difficult to start and stop and reseting it to zero takes some patience...  it looks cool and the time is correct but it is definitely not a reliable device in the least.

As others have mentioned already, I found this thing to be very, very "wobbly". 

I never, ever felt comfortable riding with my (almost 4-year-old) son on this thing. It just felt too unstable.

I returned this after only a few days

I bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when I rode on vacation When I assembled the trailer, the chain was twisted.  I bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it.  

Then the chain kept falling off the front chainwheel.  The sprocket was badly bent.  I bought a large screwdriver to straighten the chainwheel.  By the time I got it all working, my vacation was over.  

By the time I see my granddaughter again, she'll have her own bike.  I'm going to try to find someone with a small child to give the trailer to

I rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid's bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike.  I also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child's bike straight, but I never recived the part.  I am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they didn't help me. I hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs.

Thank you

Front wheel was badly bent right out of the box and needed to be replaced. Box had no signs of damage so it looks like it was put into the box this way. I replaced the front rim at my own expense and assembled the bike only to find it also needed a tuneup. The gear shifters were not adjusted properly and shifting would often result in the chain jumping back and forth.

I didn't want to pay for a tuneup and hope there wouldn't be other expenses down the road to deal with so I decided to return the bike and buy something local I can get a look at before we buy

My complaints about this stand:
1. By far the worst thing about this stand is it leans too far forward.  There's not enough counter-weight so a slight pull on the bike will cause the thing to tip.  If it wasn't for this, I might say, "well I guess it's alright for 79 dollars."
2. The clamp isn't strong enough to hold the bike securely.  If you clamp to seat-post for example it will rotate on the seat-post.
3. The thing that tightens the clamp is made of plastic.  I'm assuming it will break fairly quickly.
4. The rotator is made of plastic - I haven't tried rotating on the seat post where it would put any weight on the rotator, but I doubt it will hold it.
In my opinion this product should not be sold.  If you just want to clean your bike on a stand, it's fine, but for anything that requires any force like taking the pedals or crank arms off, forget-about-it

I ordered this item, thinking it was a pair.  When I received it and realized my error, I ordered another of the exact same item.  When I got it, I found that it was half an inch wider than the first, a different shade of color, and the pile seemed thinner and flattened.

Now I'm ordering a pair from a different company.  Hopefully the higher price indicates better quality

I tried this on the day I got it to see how it felt.  The velcro is so strong that when I tried to take it off, the velcro ripped the top layer of the material right off.  I would not advise buying this.  I was dissappointed in the quality of this product.

Like you (I'm sure) I saw this machine on television (mistake number one) and then ordered it online without ever trying it first. This machine is a joke. If you cannot get your legs over your head then MAYBE this machine is for you. But this is NOT for serious users who stretch everyday. I can do more with my $5 stretch band from Target than I can with this big heavy space-taking piece of junk. The resistance is zero, and just laughable over all. Save yourself the money, and frustration - buy a lightweight no-hassle stretch band!

I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. 

Why by a gun from these guys?  If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back.  Want a refund?  You pay a 15% restocking fee.  Take a pass on Airsplat.

Its light was okay, although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book. The main problem is it's too shabby to survive a battery change--so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out. Also, finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy.

Not Amazon's fault, but Everlast's.  Even the box promises 2 10-pound weights, but it is in fact a 10-pound set of 2 5-pound weights.  This is not a bargain, but fairly expensive.  Quality is just ok.  Not flimsy or dangerous, but not what I wanted, either

I got this because it was cheap at K-Mart, and thank goodness I can return it. The ball is really small--I love how they omit the size from all of their information. I didn't pump it up with the pump, so I don't know how good that is (I used an air compressor)...the other equipment isn't too bad, but I was really getting this for the ball, which just so happens to be a piece of poopola. I wouldn't suggest getting this

I had a different experience than the other reviewer. I would also consider myself a beginner golfer, but the Medicus has not worked for me.   It might work if you have never picked up a golf club and you are learning for the first time, but if you are trying to improve your swing it doesn't help.  You develop a way to swing the club without breaking the hinge, but it is still a bad swing. 

I heard from a golf pro that it is good if you already have a solid swing and you are trying to improve it, but not good for beginners.

    They say it will be delivered in its original carton, but they don't mention they have been opening up the boxes and swapping out the new console boxes with returned ones.

    The box came with two bright yellow strapping bands, and certainly looked sealed when I signed for it at delivery. Later that evening, when I cut the bands I was surprised when the top lifted open, the staples on the carton top were not attached and the box was already open. I cut the box open and started laying the parts out. when I pulled the carton containing the console out, the box end flap was open and smashed up where it had been put into the styrofoam. every thing else looked undisturbed. I pulled the console out of the box and could see that it must have been returned, the bubble wrap was torn, and the six screws to mount it were missing.

   I called schwinn and they are going to send me the six missing screws, and I called Amazon to tell them what was going on, I would have sent it back, but I had cut the box open and don't think there is any way I could cram it all back together. 

   Just look the box over carefully when they deliver it, the staples on the top were carefully centered between the holes where the longer staples that originally sealed the box were removed. They sure fooled me into accepting a opened box.

The console that came with mine is broken...so I haven't been able to use it.  I have been told by the customer support people @ Schwinn/Bowflex - since the middle of February - that a replacement is on it's way (even the "supervisor" said this to me).  Hear that ticking?  Yeah, that's the clock on my warranty - it is just going away without ever even getting a chance to try the thing out.  Am I happy...NO!!  Maybe I'll write another review when I get my new console and I can tell you how wonderful this piece of equipment is - until then - I'm one heck of a ticked off customer.  Save yourself the headache and just go to the gym

I notice several other reviews mentioning faulty/defective consoles arriving. Well, I received my first Schwinn 438 about a month ago. I put it all together, and realized they did not ship an AC adapter with the machine. I contacted Amazon, they told me to either send the machine back for another or contact the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer on Saturday, they were closed. I contacted them the following Monday and they told me the item was on back order, but, I could buy a compatible adapter from Radio Shack. I did. I came home excited to use my elliptical, unfortunately, the console did nothing but beep at me..very frustrating. I contacted the manufacturer again, they advised me that the console was on backorder and would not be delivered for at least 2 months. They recommended I send the unit back to Amazon for a replacement. I did so. I spent the better part of a night taking the thing apart and repackaging it...quite a job trying to squeeze it back in the box. About 3 weeks later, I received my second elliptical. Same faulty console problem, after spending another couple of hours putting the thing together. Contacted Amazon and demanded a full refund and return. They did pick the unit up, and did not make me take it all apart this time, but, I am still awaiting a full refund. I have since purchased a Vision Fitness elliptical from a real fitness shop in my area. I am extremely happy with the unit, although it was a few hundred bucks more. This was one horrific experience with Amazon. I wouldn't recommend buying this product, seems like they are shipping out defective units

This pedometer is so cheap it isn't worth the $1.88 pricetag.  Unless you want to cheat yourself, this is not the pedomter for you.  You gain 20 steps just putting it on your pants, then walking to my co-workers desk five steps from mine I gained about 30 steps.  By the end of my work day I had apparently walked 11,953 steps that I mostly acquired turning in my office chair, and I won't even go on to say how many steps you gain driving in your car.  On top of all this, the company wouldn't refund me on the pedometers I ordered for my co-workers

This pedometer is not very reliable.  It is very inaccurate in its count.  It counts a step at the littlest movement.  I put it on counted out a hundred steps and checked it and it said 260.  Just moving it to look at it recorded more steps.  If you want something really accurate spend more money

I am the captain of a walking team and I purchased several of these pedometers as incentives for my team members.  I wore my pedometer before giving the rest out just to test it.  On the very first day, the pedometer lost count of my steps on three occasions, and by the end of the day, one of the buttons had fallen off.  I do not feel comfortable giving these pedometers to my walkers.  I should have invested a little more money per item to get the best value for my money

I purchased 5 of these for Christmas presents. I tried one out in order to demonstrate at the proper time.
Number 1: This was dead in the box. So were numbers 2, 3 and 4. I didn't bother with number 5. Every flashlight was shaken more than what the measly instructions suggested. Speaking of instructions, they tell you to "make certain the light is off before attempting to charge." There is a rubber button that doesm't click or sound in anyway do there is no way of telling what the on or off position is.
Real junk, says "hummer", made in China and all five are going back

This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler. 

1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy 
2. Door Stop 
3. Play Street Hockey 
4. Stress Release Stomping Toy 
5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift 
6. Modern Art for Coffee Table 
7. Nerf Ball Target Practice 
8. Condom Dispenser 

Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun! 

PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at: Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it.

This Fender is WAY to short on a 17" frame with 26" wheels. 80% of the frame were it suppossed to stop the mud and bricks hitting fails badly.  the rear part is abuot 5"+ to short to stop most of the mud.

I got it to stop bricks damaging my Giant bike frame and failed....

2 stars for build of it and the 20% of mud it actualy stops..

DO NOT buy this is you plan it for the same reason i got it for..

When it is windy, the top of a canopy like this needs to be removed to prevent wind damage. No information is available on how long it takes to do this. I called D.C. America and they say they are only distributors and buy it overseas and have no idea and have no manuals available online for me to look at. They said it takes a few hours to assemble or disassemble. One retailer I spoke with, Fogdog, guesses it would need to be disassembled to remove the top, but he admitted they have not tried assembling it.

So it appears from what these two sources said that every time a wind storm comes up, it would require half-a-day to disassemble it then reassemble it - not something I care to do.

Are there any owners out there that can answer this question? Can the frame be left up and only the top covering removed? If so, how long would it take to remove the top covering? Is it easy to do? It is a nice looking unit, but unfortunately the sellers cannot answer the most basic question for an item like this. Thanks.

The accessories that come along with this nice are great, albeit somewhat impractical (who's going to use a slingshot, anyway?), but the thing that stands out most about this knife is the plastic handle.  Survival knives with hollow handles can go either way as far as usefulness and quality, but this handle has a cheap, brittle feel to it that suggests easy breakage.  It's not too hard to conceive that the blade could break off from the handle under enough stress, which makes this blade a dangerous one to use.  Do not buy this knife, or any other knife with a hollow plastic handle

This product never worked -- buttons were defective, it wouldn't stay on, it wouldn't calibrate. The seller - Sky Box USA - wouldn't exchange or refund because I was outside of the "30 day window" (this was a Christmas present, and a very disappointing one at that). You'll want to look elsewhere for technology that should be as reliable as a Casio watch

The IR link for the Polar hear monitors is great.  It allows you to transfer data 2 ways from your PC:  you can download your exercise data, and also change the settings for the watch from the computer.  This is great, because it means no scrolling through abbreviations on the watch with the tiny buttons.
The biggest problem with the IR link is the driver that needs to be installed on your computer.  For whatever reason, Polar decided not to pay Bill Gates to get the software recognized as being compatible with Microsoft.  When installing the driver from the included CD, warnings and error messages pop up to discourage you from proceeding, which will compromise all security and firewall features that you might have.  There is no updated version available for download from the internet.  I went ahead and installed the driver, but since doing so, the computer has not been functioning properly, and I've been getting those "send error report / don't send error report" pop-ups from Windows.  Polar denies responsibility and insists that their driver is "fine" for use.  I'm no computer expert, so I don't know for sure, but I don't believe them

I'm pretty good at getting devices up and running, but this thing is a complete mess. They don't have the software figured out, and the instructions for trying to fix it when it's not working are preposterously complicated. Note that it comes with no directions of any kind. In fact, it arrives with an unlabeled mini-disc with no indication of what it's for, what it is, how to use it, whether everyone needs it, or anything else. Nothing but the blank disc. Note that this device failing to work is a "Frequently Asked Question" on the Polar web site, and they have a list of about thirty things you're supposed to "check," most of which they don't explain as far as what it is you're checking FOR. (In other words, they say "Check the [whatever] setting," but they don't tell you anything about what that setting should be or what might be wrong with it.) Most of the instructions are outdated, don't apply to current version of Windows, or don't reflect current versions of their own software.

Mine will be going back -- the first thing from Amazon I have ever had to return

I bought this ab roller after my chiropractor told me that I needed to strengthen my abs without straining my neck.  The "neck support" that it comes with does not support the neck or head in any way, but forces all of the weight of the head onto the uppermost vertebrae of the neck.  Ouch!  I would strongly recommend AGAINST this purchase.  Not only does it not work properly, but the foam pads were stained upon arrival.  Gross!  I will try another model

After inserted the 9V battery, I just pushed the button to start shuffling one time, and I heard a cracking noise right away. One piece of the mechanism fell off, and I could hear it when shaking the box. Of course, the shuffler was broken...

This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler.

1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy
2. Door Stop
3. Play Street Hockey
4. Stress Release Stomping Toy
5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift
6. Modern Art for Coffee Table
7. Nerf Ball Target Practice
8. Condom Dispenser

Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun!

PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at: Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it

I wouldn't recommend this shuffler to anyone.  It shuffles more from one side than the other.  When through shuffling on the left side the right side is only half through.  The cards will jam in the tray stopping the rest of the cards from coming down.  The switch just works part time, you have to stop and restart several times

I bought this for my four year old for Christmas.  The net was broken on the second use when my four year old lightly banged it on our car bumper.  A week later, his friend, also four, broke one of the sticks when taking a shot with the feather-weight plastic puck that comes with the set.  Don't waste your money. Even for little kids it's probably worth it to just go ahead and buy real equipment that will last.

To call this a bad machette would be to generous. It is more accurately described as a machette shaped object. 

As other have noted the blade is thin, too flexible, easily rusts, and fails to hold an edge. The handle is poorly made and mine had sharp edges where the handle halves were joined. If you use it without wearing gloves this "tool" will do more dammage to your hand than to the target vegetation. 

Th sheath material is 1 step above paper. Technically it will hold the machette on your belt. But if you draw the machette with anything other than utmost care you will cut the sheath. 

I can't believe a company with a valuable name like Coleman would put their brand on this embarassing piece of garbage.

This tool will not take an edge, either with a grinder or a file.  It is very flexible so that the energy of a blow goes into flexing the blade rather than cutting stems, which has undesirable consequences for your hand.  If you are looking for a useful tool, keep looking

These Coleman machetes are essentially useless.  They are so lightweight and flexible, I don't know what they intended them to be used for.  They will cut some weeds, but they won't cut through brush or any woody plants thicker than maybe 1/2 inch.  I have used a few of these, as they are the most commonly available at the hardware stores where I live.  They also rust badly.  

You're much better off with an Ontario Knife machete, or another better machete.

We were very disappointed with this style trampoline enclosure.  As it only attaches to 4 of the eight legs, it essentially reduces your round trampoline to a much smaller square.  We were constantly trying to find ways to pull it away from the jumping area as it sort of "caves in".  We finally gave up and purchased a new one that attaches on the OUTSIDE of the poles that attach to all eight legs

I was looking for a trampoline and I kept looking around for the encloser trampolines.  I purchased the 13 foot trampoline encloser but I didn't realize that the trampoline came separate.  I have the encloser kit witch I spent $70.00 on and no trampoline.  When I looked on the internet I never saw that the tramponine was separate and it wasn't clearly explained that it was just the encloser part.  I also found out that the size of the trampone is not standard, therefore, in order to utilize the encloser kit, I have to spend another $110.00 for shipping on top of the shipping it cost me for the cover and the encloser kit.  I am really upset that this is costing a large amount of money just because they didn't specifically say that the encloser kit needed the trampoline. Bevery careful, it is not every day that you go out and buy a trampoline and the encloser kits are totaly separate.  I am very disapointed

These noisemakers are too big and hard for my one year old, she bonks herself with them. My toddler and preschooler are not particularly interested in them. They make fairly interesting noises, but are awkward to hold and shake and are somewhat heavy for their size. No one really plays with them much. I would not recommend them.

1. Calories shown during a workout are about 1.5 to 2 times actual.
   I do have the right weight entered in my user profile.
2. Machine broke right after warranty ran out.
   No manual. No reasonable support. I paid $850, including shipping.
   It is now sitting in my bedroom in a state of partial disassembly.
   Nothing about fixing this is intuitive. Some of the nuts and screws 
   are so tightly put on, you cannot budge them.

I am going to throw this junk out and buy a non-schwinn elliptical that
has a better warranty and real servicabilty. Customer support at 
1-800-864-1270 is practically useless.

Save you rmoney. Buy something else

We received this product for Christmas in 2005 and within two weeks the console broke. We contacted Schwinn immediately and was told we would receive a replacement console. It is now May 1st and the console we need is still on backorder --- 5 MONTHS!!!!! It is absolutely ridiciulous. I call each week and I get the same response.

Unfortunately, we should have contacted Amazon within the 30 day period to get reconciliation from Amazon. Lesson learned there.

The product when it was working was fine. But the pain since then is not worth it. 

I do not recommend this product

We bought this trainer over 4 monhs ago from a local fitness store.  From the beginning the heart rate programs never worked properly.  I train using a Heart Rate Monitor so I  can follow my heart rate during excercise,  If we tried to use the Schwinn's 418's HR programs it read anywhere from 40 to  60 BPM too low!!!, What that meant is that the machine kept on increasing the resistance thinking my wife or myself were cruising along at a nice 99 BPM when we were going aerobic at over 150 !!!.  Not only is that  dangerous, especially for someone who never trained before, but it made 30% of the machines functions unusable.  Add a display that's hard to read, controls that are anything but logical, and this unit is a loser, no matter what  Consumer Reports says.  On top of that spare parts took forever to get delivered, and when they arrived, the machine still malfunctioned.  The only thing good out of our experiance was the sales person  who worked with us to exchange the Schwinn for a better trainer from another company.  Bottom line,  stay away from the Schwinn 418, there's a reason Schwinn  only put a sx month warranty on labor and electronics, they knew this machine is worthless, don't you find out the hard way

Warning: Broken after 350 miles..  a post mortem

After 350 miles of moderate usage (6.5MPH average at fairly low resistance for 40 minutes daily) a piece of metal snapped on one of the arms, rendering the trainer inoperable. Unfortunately this was considered a "wear item" and was not warrantied by the manufacturer since the elliptical was used *very* lightly (perhaps 20 miles max) during the first year of purchase (warranty period). I put the majority of mileage on the machine over the past four months and, while it was great for burning calories, I never really felt that it was a "quality" piece of equipment.

It appears that the manufacturer knows what parts of the frame are likely to break first and conveniently labels these "wear items" , thus making repair expensive and difficult... this is in spite of the fact that the piece that broke was a non-moving, load-bearing support piece. Seems a little fishy to me.

Throughout the life of the machine I was constantly tightening bolts to fix the popping and banging sounds that occurred after moderate use, and observed that the wheels would often attempt to jump out of the tracks with heavier use. After about 70 miles I noted that the wheels were leaving large greyish streaks in the tracks from where they were wearing down against imperfections in the track surface. I believe this was also partly due to too much "play" in the interaction of the wheels and tracks, allowing the wheels to jump the tracks a little which each revolution.

This machine does not feel very sturdy and, throughout the last month of its very short life, gave me a creepy sense of impending doom whenever I used it... somehow I knew it was about to break and, unfortunately, it did. My hunch was real enough that I began shopping for a replacement several weeks ago.

Please shop around... I would not recommend this machine for people looking for a moderate to high intensity workout, but it may be fine for slower walking or jogging paced routines that place less stress on the machine's mechanical components. If you are an infrequent user this model may be OK, but if you plan on using it every day I would recommend that you keep on looking.

Note that my machine was a 428P which, at the time of purchase, differed from the 418 primarily in the computer and heart rate monitoring. The frame is identical in the 418 and 428P, which appears to be no longer sold. Since the problems with my machine were directly related to body construction, they are appropriate for a review of the 418. Unless the manufacturer has made major improvements the problems I experienced are likely to still occur. Visual inspection of the pictures here leads me to believe that no major changes have been made to the frame construction

I just bought this through Amazon and then put it together pretty quickly.  Packaging was lousy, as others have already mentioned, and 3 pieces were either missing or broken, so I had to call for them.  First customer service rep was ok, but the next day I found the pedal crank making a sound, and called back, but the next rep claimed that I put the pedals on wrong and refused to exchange the main part containing the gears.  I held up the phone to the machine so he could hear it, and he acknowledged hearing the noise, but said I would have to open up the unit and identify the broken or loose piece on my own.  The unit came w/ that part already sealed, so I don't know how they can expect me to spend my time playing maintenance technician on their product.  Although the product appears to be engineered well, any company that's not willing to correct their mistakes deserves a negative rating

The first Schwinn Fitness 212 that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit. The second one arrived but does not work. After calling technical assistance and being instructed to re-examine the contacts (which I did), it still does not work. This is absolutely useless. They will have to do something

This stopwatch has an amazing array of functions but is difficult to use; sometimes it behaves erratically and starts timing up instead of counting down, or starts all over again when the countdown is only half done. Don't know if it's really misbehaving or it's just on some obscure other function when I think I set it for countdown...? Operating manual is available online pdf, and it's several pages long

This would be a great rebounder, if it were not so cheaply made.
One month after happily using it, a spring broke, then another.
It is one of the least expensive models out there and I guess there is a reason for that. Best to save your money and buy a more expensive model

I previously owned and used the 5 mi. version to communicate with my wife while I am going to and from the school bus stop for the kids. From the bus stop the 5 mi. unit was iffy.  I purchased the 16 Mi. units thinking the little extra power and range would make for better receive at the bus stop. It was worse. We received no signal whatsoever, not a peep.  Don't buy this unit. Save your money and buy the 5 mi unit

Just did a A/B comparison between the SX800R (16 mile range)and the Midland GXT-450 (10 or 12 mile range).  Neither radio came anywhere near the effective range advertised.  The Midland lost communcation after 1/2 of a mile apart in the woods.  I then tried both radios on a flat open road.  At 2.9 miles apart, neither radio could pick up it's counterpart.  It wasn't until we hit the 1.8 mile mark that the Motorola picked up some static from the other Motorola.  Still nothing from the Midland.  At approx 1.5 miles apart, the motorola worked fine.  I gave up with the Midland.  The reason I did not give the Motorola a 1 star rating was because I like the weather band feature.  Bottom line is, that unless you are in an airplane with no obstructions at all or curvature of the earth to worry about, forget about getting anywhere near the advertised range.  A good rule of thumb is, if you can see the other person, then you are in range.

I bought this exact one maybe a year ago. About 2 months later it just collapses. Set up is not the onlt thing that is hard, actully trying to get a high jump is VERY difficult. This is a little kids toy but most little kids don't just like baby bounces do they? I would not recommend this trampoline to ANYBODY

I was attracted to the Thermoskin product because it looked more comfortable than rigid splints for night wear, and because Thermoskin advertised that it could be worn while sitting during the day.  The product indeed has a clever-seeming design, and it is well manufactured.  

But ultimately, this product seems to me to be too floppy and unstable to consistently stretch out the area of the foot that FEELS to me like it needs to be stretched. (I.e., the area along the sole of my foot that I can feel stretching out in the mornings when, before getting out of bed and while sitting up in it, I press my toes hard against a looped cord or towel; that stretch significantly diminishes my pain upon standing up out of bed.)  The velcro fastenings are indeed secure, but the product's sock-like sleeve and ankle cuff move around some even when the straps are cinched down as tight as they'll go; as a result, what feels like an appropriate stretch typically disappears in about five or ten minutes of normal movement and friction in bed while lying down.  Worse, the angle created by pulling the strap up through the buckle in front of the lower leg just doesn't create the proper stretch; instead it just makes my toes feel crampy.

I'm going to try a rigid split, which may be less comfortable.  But I believe that I need to be strapped into something that consistently maintains a proper angle, which the Thermoskin product doesn't.  And I'd rather incur some discomfort, if it will actually help me get well, than continue to use this not too uncomfortable (but ineffective) product from Thermoskin.  

Perhaps others have had or will have better results with it than I have had; and I have no medical training nor deep insight into the anatomy or physiology beyond what I've read on the internet, so consider this to be very much a layman's review.  I've been suffering from plantar faciitis now for about four to five months with little improvement, and I can't compare this product to others that I hope might be more effective.  

But I was very disappointed in this product, and regret having spent the money for it

Most enthusiastic cyclists and bike shop clerks I talked to dislike this product. I've used it a number of times myself and I would never use it again (especially after I discovered better products). It turns your chain and drive train into a black mess. Finish Line was better. TriFlow was recommended by a number of cyclists.

We purchased this ATV for our son who turned 7 in February.  The first time he rode it the battery came loose and disconnected.  We fixed that within a few minutes and he continued riding it.  The next day my son came in after riding it and the throttle was loose.  I tried to tighten it but the Allen screw stripped and it would not tighten.  In addition, the rear axle was bent from shipping.  We called service and they sent us a new throttle and tire rims, not axles.  I did not even try to replace the throttle because I knew the Allen screw was not capable of tightening properly.  So, I went to the local hardware store and purchased a stainless steel screw and was able to correct the problem.  The next day after he was riding it the steering was out of alignment so I twisted the handle bars and force them to straighten out.  I have to do this every time he rides the ATV.  The kids rode the ATV yesterday and I changed the speed key switch to the lower speed so my 4 year old daughter can ride it.  I have change the setting about five times and the switch broke.  It will no longer change to the slow setting.  It is either on fast mode or off.  Needless to say that my son does not want to ride on it because he thinks it will break every time he does

I purchased two of these, one for each of my sons. I received them quickly and the packaging was in good shape. When we took the first one out and tightened the handlebars and so on to get it ready to charge and ride everything seemed ok. But the wires where you plug the charger into the 4 wheeler had to tightened and so did the place you turned the key to change speeds. Got it charging, we think. Then we start on the second one. We take it out and the charger is half melted. Ok, not too good but since we ordered two we thought we could just use the charger from the other one since they were the same. Well, when we plugged the charger to the second four wheeler after about 1 hour we went back out to the garage where it was charging and the charger we were using that had come with the first four wheeler had started to melt! Nevermind that the house could have caught on fire! So apparently someone had plugged the original charger in and that had already happened, rather than someone just having packaged a defective charger. Nice for someone to pack it back up and send it to me used and defective. The first four wheeler turned on and ran ok for a few minutes so it must have been charged, we went ahead and plugged it up as the instructions said - as if we had received it brand new like we thought we had. When it was used the first time it ran for a little over an hour, with only the the light popping out of the front with every little bump. And the light didn't work. While trying to re-attach the light we found several places that needed to be tightened up. We can't re-charge it though because the only good charger between the two was melted. When we first took these out of the boxes they were small (big enough for a 3 or 4 year old) but they looked pretty sturdy, much better than the plastic ones you get from Walmart, and I paid close to the same amount. They were difficult to get out of the packaging, because there is a metal frame in the box that needed to be taken apart, but that should have been good, to protect during shipping. However when you think about how you are going to get them back in the metal frame and box and shipping to send them back so someone can possibly see how bad the whole mess is you start to get cranky and tired. I will admit that I haven't tried to return them. I am quite worried that it will be as much trouble as these things have been already. I am tempted though, because I would like to let people know about this type of problem before they waste their money. Imagine how dissapointed I was that right before Christmas I couldn't give the kids two of their bigger gifts because they were junk. I am VERY upset. So now several hundred dollars (times two) that could have bought very nice Christmas presents just flushed down the drain.

Purchased three of these at Christmas.  Horns and lights did not work on but one, another was missing keys when delivered, luckily interchangable.  Within 5 days, one four wheeler had a faulty throttle and quit, the drive train fell out of the other with bolts going everywhere, and the third had two bald tires which burst!  All this before the new year turned.  I contacted the company, and they offered assistance by sending a box of parts in the mail.  However, they offered no assistance on actual repair, telling me that "any man can do it with a few tools".  After several hours and a visit to the tire shop, I fixed the bikes and they seem to work fine for now.  I obviously question the quality of the product and be aware return shipping is not an option b/c these bikes are heavy and it would be cost prohibitive.  I would buy at a store where I could take back if needed.  Good luck.

This is not the same model I bought but it looks like it's built the same way.  I bought the InMotion Trampoline by Stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use.  It didn't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off.  When I called for warrantey information, I had waited too long, it is only guaranteed for 90 days.

I'd give it negative stars, but I have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up

I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the "sticky" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor.

This tricycle is simply way too big.  While the seat position is adjustable, even when adjusted, this thing is simply huge!  I imagine my 2 year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster.  By then, he'll be 5 or 6 and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike, so I just don't get the point of this.  Why in the world would someone build a trike so big?

I did like that the trike had large pneumatic tires, and was fairly sturdy (at least in terms of construction).  I suppose if you have a really large child that wants a trike instead of a bike, maybe this monster would be OK. I did have a few issues with design and/or build quality though: First, the grips are fairly fragile plastic and I imagine will break after just a tumble or two.  Second, the way the seat "adjustment" works is simply by sliding the seat clamp up and down the main support bar.  This would be OK, but the seat clamp was too big for the support bar, so I had to shim it with something to get it to stay in place.    

Overall, I'm just not very impressed.

This watch has a great look and much potential 'under the hood', but I am having to return mine because of a defective altimeter - it gives readings of up to 1000ft difference in altitude over the course of a few days in the same location during the same kind of weather. 

I was also disappointed to find that the alarm was barely audible - certainly not loud enough to get my attention if it is under my sleeve - and the metal finish of the watch and band is extremely scratch-prone. I cannot recommend this watch for the price it sells for, even if the altimeter worked correctly.

If your toes get hot it has a zipper for that. (useless)  Better off getting a rectangular if you need more legroom.  

Its small (Even the long one)for a big guy.

The bag is nice and everything, but the zipper does not come down very far and makes the bag tough to get into.

Also, my feet got cold because of the zippered area.  Not really sure I understand why it's there.  My feet never get warm, usually cold.

I liek the material and the look.  Also seemed to keep me warm on a 60 deg. night

its rickety. the bar stands are right where you would want to grip the bar so your either way too wide or close on your grip with a constant battle to not pinch your hands when putting the wieght back up. it is also very hard to adjust and often get stuck. in incline position the stands get in your way again because it obstructs your range of motion. not worth half the money it goes for

I figured I'd give these a shot, since I've heard good things about them.  First off, though, to put these tees in the ground, you have to guide them with a finger; otherwise, they'll bend. 

The control and distance differences for me seemed negligable compared to traditional wooden tees.  Also, because of the sharp edges, there are now some nice grooves on the sole of my new 905R.  I wouldn't recommend these tees if you have an expensive club you don't want dinged up, unless those extra five yards really mean that much.  If you have a slower swing speed than I do, though, (mine's about 105-110mph) the grooves might not be an issue.

The only reason that I gave these even two stars is because they last forever.  When I was trying them out, I was playing 18 holes, minus the par 3's, without breaking a single tee. Overall, though, they aren't really suited for me as is

The HR monitor buttons got stuck in the down position on 1st use, no use any more. Also the shape of the back suggests it is designed for small wrists, not at all comfortable on mine

This product was dificult to get a heart rate reading on unless you are walking, would not give a heart rate even at low running speeds. I used this product 4 times and both heart monitor buttons fell off

Don't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch.  This monitor is sold as "providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout".  Since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout Reebok did to substantiate this claim.  Get a strapped monitor for working out.  While this is a great idea the design doesn't match the intended purpose

I only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began. It started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else. Very annoying! Also, the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse. While it is a low impact machine, it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals. This is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout. I am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine. Do not waste your money

i bought a supra model gazelle at sears for 179.00. i thought it is so light and the shock absorbers made a good form of resistance. well after a year the welds cracked for the shock absorber holders and are useless so i took them off.the guy at sears(where i bought the junkpiece) says,"Ew,man too bad"!!Remember that the light tubuler construction while making for ease in transport also means ease in breakage. Another machine meant for looking good in leotards sipping a sports drink and put it away if you start sweating.if you dont the sweat will rust out the weld joints and who knows where you'll be catapulted to when the next thing on it goes.maybe Maybe Tony little will give a surprise visit to you in the hospital!

I bought this bag for a 7 day bivouac hunt in the North Dakota Badlands. The average nightly temps were 40-50 F. The bag was warm during these windy and chilly nights. The bag compresses down reasonably small and is relatively light weight. On my second night of the hunt, I was zipping up the bag and the zipper broke right off of the bag. It didn't just come off, it literally broke. There was no way to fix this in the back country. I had my hunting buddy wrap some duct tape around me at night and then unwrap me like a giant tamalie every morning. He spent big $$$ for his bag and of course, had zero problems with it. Oh well, for the price and free shipping, this isn't too bad of a deal, just remember to bring plenty of duct tape with you.

I receieved the Valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym, after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous. I purchased them after I lost my previous pair of TKO Fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems. I put on the Valeo straps and did one pull-up, and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in. My advice, this product is poorly made and cheap. A complete waste of money. Go with something better, and I would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric.

I give it two stars for the Snorkel, the mask and the fins are just JUNK!! 
The Mask: The mask is a purge mask...meaning it has a small disk that, in theory,lets you blow any excess water that enters the mask by just blowing. The problem is this, any speck of debris that gets caught between the disk or a simple malformation will cause water to constantly enter the mask. AND if you happen to suck in via your nose you'll definately get a mask full of water.

The Fins: The're a strap type fin which is good BUT they are so tight you can't wear any dive booties or dive socks which comes in quite handy if you're walking over coral, rocks or any other sharp objects. The biggest issue with the fins is the strap comes off while swimming. This set was for my wife and hers came off I didn't think to much of it until mine did too. You might say, buy smaller fins but they run in a Size x to Size X so you can't buy any smaller. 

The Snorkel is ok, It's a little short but it works

I found these gloves to be OK for short rides, but the stiffness of the material around the fingers made it painful.  I actually had to remove the glove from my right hand after a while because the pain was getting annoying.  Granted, these are Mtn Biking gloves, I don't understand why they would make them so stiff as to actually dig into the hand.  I've tried to break them in, but after a dozen or more rides, they are still stiff

For one, the gun doesnt shoot 380 fps.  Secondly they spelled enhanced "enchanced." They may have even done this on purpose, seeing as you are taking a chance by buying the gun.  It's about 50/50 whether or not the gun comes to you in working condition

Do not buy this gun from Hot Import Toys. That is my main point. It took a very long time to get to me (8 days) and when it did, it was broken. Not that it was shattered or it was jammed. It just didn't work. The piston seemed to be fine, the motor seemed to be connected, the gearbox seemed to be in tact, the batter (although a little hard to install) was charged, and the trigger was connected to the gear box. I thought that I could return it for either a working gun or just a refund. No. I e-mailed HIT over 7 times over the course of a couple weeks. Nothing! I got no response, no notification, nothing. I continued e-mailing them because they didn't even post a phone number to reach them at on their site! HIT is the worst company to buy from ever! From what i see and know, this gun seems to be quite the MPEG! I would have loved to use it to its fullest with my friends but unfortunately, I bet you anyhting that HIT will decide to wait until the 30 day warranty has expired before they e-mail me back: telling me of how the warranty time is up and that they aren't allowed to exchange my product. BUY FROM AIRSPLAT!!! Trust me. This is a good gun. Fast, accurate, good looking. Do not waste a month of your time waiting for it to arrive, having to find its broke, waiting for them to e-mail you back, and then have to live with a broken, useless piece of potential Airsoft gun. So trust me, don't buy from Hot Import Toys

The gun did not work.  When we emailed Hot Import Toys, they gave a suggestion on how to fix it.  That didn't work.  We emailed them asking for a new one.  No response.  We emailed them again, asking for a paid return label since we paid over $20 in shipping and handling.  They told us to take it to Fed Ex and tell Fed Ex it was defective and that Fed Ex wouldn't charge shipping.  Fed Ex doesnt work like that!!  We called this company numerous times, left numerous messages...no return calls.  We emailed Amazon and complained.  Got a response from Amazon and had to pay over $19 out of pocket to send it back to Hot Imports.  Amazon says they will credit our account.  I strongly suggest to take your business elsewhere.  No invoice was enclosed with the product.  My sons friend also ordered from this company and the gun did not work either..

My friend and I both bought this gun. We both charged it for the recommended time and it never worked. I could throw BB's with my toes faster than this if the gun worked on a good day. In ten minutes only 1 BB came out of the barrel and it just rolled out. It doesn't work, 'nuff said. All it's good for now is to be my back scratcher. Buy a pack of bendy straws to shoot BB's, they will work better than  this gun. Thank you for your time. Good nigh

<review_text>
I have an ICS M4A1.  I am basing my thoughts on this based on what some of the airsoft forums I am registered to have said on this.  I am registered on Arnies, Airsoft Core, and Airsoft Retreat.

1) This gun is from a very, very unreliable company (Well), so you have more chances of getting a bad gun than you do for getting a good one.  This is common knowledge among the airsoft community.

2) Lets say you buy 4 of these guns... each of them costing 100 dollars.  Even over a 5-10 year span, that adds up to a lot of money being spent on a gun that breaks consistantly.  People who have skirmished with an LPEG (Low-Powered Electric Gun) find that the exterior can actually break if shot at with an AEG that shoots 330 FPS with .2g (standard for companies like Toyko Marui, ICS, Classic Army, G&G, Airsoft Elite).  The one thing that this suggests that the gun is badly made.

3) The gearbox (part of gun that fires bbs) broke on mine.  In short, it has a metal gearbox, made of the cheapest metal known to man.  The purpose of this for the company that makes to this get money.  It is very, very weak.  Definitely not worth it.

4) The "Hop-Up" on this gun is non-existant.  The fundamentals of hop-up is a backspin is added to BBs to increase range and accuracy.  Effective range of this- 50 feet (not meters).  Effective range of my ICS M4A1 (with a aftermarket tightbore added) is 150 feet.

5) This gun will get laughed at.  Some children walk into an organized skirmish with this LPEG, telling people that it will own all others, and they will cry home when players with real AEGS destroy them.  I suppose it is fine for backyard wars, but who on Earth would spend 100 dollars for a crappy gun for backyard wars?

6) The cost does not equal quality.  If you think about all of the accessories that come with this gun (light, laser, ect), then account for shipping from CHINA, then the packaging costs (pre-molded styrofoam), you will realize that this gun is very, very cheaply made.  You do not want to be spending so much for so little quality.  The laser itself can sell for 20 dollars.

Put it short, it is not worth it

I purchased these so I wouldn't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat.  However, they didn't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws.  Additionally, after only a few classes, the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws, particularly on the foot paws.  I guess they would be okay for someone who doesn't ever have sweaty palms and who doesn't do any intense postures.  Otherwise, I would recommend doing what I do now - use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather/suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat

The product is well made, and a great idea for travel without a mat.  However, I bought it so I would slip less in my postures once I started sweating.  However, although the paws don't slip on the floor surface, your skin slips out of them when you sweat, making them worthless. Guess I will stick with having a towel around!

Other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason. Over 65% of the decks are marked and unusable. That means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be OK for poker play (unless you're lucky). I have purchase casino used cards before and honestly, they are not worth the trouble

Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product

We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!  

Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars.

Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.  

Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor

  I didn't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery.  This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable.  It does the job, but only just.  I've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably.  Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just won't come on.  At first it worked great.  Also, the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly.  Not in danger of falling off or anything, but just not a secure connection to the base.  Overall, the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work, but I did hope for better quality

I bought this on amazon and used the free shipping and received it about a week and a half later... Took it out of the box, it's pretty simple to put together (took about an hour). But after about 20 minutes of riding the bike on tension # 6 the rubber belt has flipped off it's wheel (like a bike chain off its gears). The bike is now completely useless as there is no resistance anymore. And I can't get to the belt to try and fix it because the cover is impossible to take off without breaking it. Tried calling customer service but they are only open on weekdays 9-5, going to have to call them from work on Monday.

Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a more quality item than this. It'll save yourself a trip to the dump, too. This bike is a piece of junk

Description of bike was misleading.  Weight limit of person using this exercise bike should have been part of description.  Small print in booklet accompanying bike says it is unsafe for more than 250 pounds.
Although I weigh slightly less than this, I am afraid to use the bike for fear of it falling apart.  I would not have purchased the bike had I seen this limit in the description.  Also, the directions for operation of this bike are very complicated.  I thought I was purchasing a simple exercise bike, not such a complicated piece of machinery.  This bike would be perfect for a younger, more athletic, slimmer person

Read the ingredients. Contains refined flour and sugar, hydrogenated oil, corn syrup, and artificial colors. For someone who may be sensitive to chemicals diabetic or hypoglycemic, this would be a poor substitute for real food. I personally would become ill from ingesting this sort of thing. Always read the labels and be sure that the product is safe for YOU

     I put this mount on my M-44 today, and I am not impressed.  There is side to side play due to the 1/32 or so gap between the side of the scope mount, and where the original sight seats.  Not a whole lot, but you don't need much play to have your zero [...] out after a couple of rounds.

     All of the set screws are loose in their respective threaded holes.  One of the set screws stripped the scope mount threads before any tension could be placed on it.  The screw that passes through the sight ears was to short to thread the included nut on, so I mounted it with the original set pin for the rear sight.  The mount did not line up with the barrel when mounted, and this was obvious to the unaided eye - the mount was pointing left of true, and I don't know if the scope would be able to compensate!  I don't think Loctite will be able to hold the set screws in place, once a few rounds have gone down range.  Some of the supplied allen wrenches didn't even fit the set screws!

     I have not fired the weapon with this thing mounted, and I am tempted to just toss it and chalk it up as a loss.  The design could work, if a little more attention was placed on the manufacturing process.

     On the plus side, it was cheap, and the shipping was quick.

This compass fails to do the one simple task I purchased it for, which is simply telling me which direction I am going. 

I spent $[...] for a [...] compass made out of crap materials. It works only for the direction you set it at. For example if you set it while facing north, it will be correct when you go north- but if you change directions, the result is completely random....

This compass only works for one direction- and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually (gasp) might turn.

absolute rippoff.

The first one I bought started going crazy within a day. The ecreen showed unintelligible symbols and the like. EVentually I could not even power it on. I was told by PNI Global to take out battery and let in sit for 12 hours. Did that then it started breaking down again. The temp sensor did not work because anywhere I placed it it was affected by other sources of heat or cold. They sent me another one which did the same thing. Now I have sent my second one back and they are going to test it and probably send me another one (my third!!!). The good news is that they are nice in customer service

This is a nice heavy item, perfect for covering your trike.  But I have yet to figure out how to put it in place.  I'vr tried all sides and in between but have never gotten it on like the picture.  My son (yes, he is a grown man) put it on better than I had on my tries. but the front wheel is still out.  They need to put some arrows on it or something!!!

I was very excited to order this bike.  As I started to put it together I noticed that some of the prepackaged parts for assembly were missing!  I still attempted assembly and noticed that pre-drilled holes weren't even close to being inline with the display!  The largest drawback and thing that upset me was that I didn't pay close enough attention when purchasing this - it is DOES NOT allow for adjustment from seat to pedals.  I'm 6'3" tall, and not being able to adjust for my height makes this completely unusable

As a bicycle enthusiast who has owned CatEye products for nearly 20 years, I eagerly attached this light to by mountain bike and went for a spin around the streets and trails of Manhattan. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with its overall usability. 

The light uses three intense bluish-white LEDs that are very easy to see from a distance when facing the light. However, these are not powerful enough to illuminate a trail, road, or pothole. In short, the light is excellent tool to acknowledge your position to oncoming motorists and other cyclists.  The flashing mode is especially easy to see. Yet, the light is simply not powerful enough to illuminate the ground before you.  Hence, it is basically useless if you are trying to avoid potholes on roads or vehicle barriers on poorly lit bicycle trails.

Pros
Good Construction
Multifunction
Waterproof

Cons
Insufficient brightness
Uses AAA instead of AA

I recently bought the Gaiam 4mm Eco Conscious Rubber Yoga mat because i want to practice my yoga on a environmentally friendly high quality mat.  After receiving this mat, i am EXTREMELY disappointed.  I feel cheated.  They claim that it is 4mm, but i measured it to be 2mm between the bumps and maximum 3mm on the bumps.  The mat is very flimsy,stretchy and slippery.  After 1 use it looks like it is rubbing apart.

Gaiam claims that it is a natural rubber mat, but it sure does not feel like a natural rubber mat.  I have used a natural rubber mat at my studio, but it is completly different that this mat.  Even my instructor questions whether this is actually a natural rubber mat, since it feels so different than the high quality natural rubber mat at the studio.  If i wanted a cheap mat, I would have just bought one of the low quality PVC mats.  I should have spent the extra $5-$10 and bought a mat from a company that is know for their quality.  Dont make the same mistake i made

Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack.
I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this.

This case is mainly MADE OF PLASTIC!!  Don't be fooled by the "aluminum" description, only the corners were aluminum, the rest just PAINTED PLASTIC.  The case came poorly packaged!  The box was too small for the case.  The case had scuff marks, and scratches on it.  Obviously NOT BRAND NEW!!  This was the worst purchase I've ever made on amazon.  Will never buy ADG SPORTS again!!!  Their label was crooked on the case too!!  Looks like a 4-year-old put it on!!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  TRUST ME!!

I purchased 3 of these for a very old bike with no holes to mount a water bottle.  One of them worked perfect, snug fit and everything worked.  The other 2 had nuts that were too large to fit in the plastic.  This is my second, and last purchase from Zefal, I was happy it wasnt made in China... but i guess the French dont believe in good quality merchandis

Okay, I have owned the Mio for 9 months now and I agree with all of the above complaints, it is not accurate, it can be difficult to run and check heart rate at same time, it's big and clunky looking, etc, etc.
My biggest beef is that this watch broke 6 months into the game.  The heart rate monitor got stuck and rendered the watch useless.  I returned it to Mio (with my $10.00 check) and 2 months later, i still have not got my watch back.  I complain regularly and they reassure me that it is being repaired in their factory.  They assured me that finally after I threw a fit, it would be shipped last week.  still no watch.  The watch not only sucks, but the company sucks as well.  save your money and buy an ironman.

Though the concept of a Heart Rate Monitor without a chest strap sounds convenient, the MIO is of absolutely no use during your workout. You have to stop your activity (be it running, biking or walking) to measure your current Heart rate, as your hand has to be steady. The calories feature does not measure the calories burned accurately and was off almost by 100 calories.

There is nothing wrong with this product, it's how you use it. We almost ruined our $300 trampoline in it's first week by using this product. We put it on our new trampoline and it fit fine. It rained the next day and filled completely with rain water, causing the trampoline to nearly collapse. It took a huge effort to remove the water out of the trampoline cover and we have not used it since. Trampolines are constructed using fabric that is breathable and will let the rain run through. By covering it, you don't allow it to drain. Unless you live in a VERY dry climate, I don't advise using a cover

This cover works well with keeping leaves and such off of the trampoline; but every single time it rains, I have to spend an hour or so getting the standing water out from the middle!  It is a back breaking job and it is hard to understand why trampoline covers are not made to handle this correctly.  More damage is done to the trampoline with the heavy water sitting there than leaves and limbs falling on it! This is a worthless item

I take yoga in a gym.  The class starts as the aerobics session ends.  I bought these socks to help keep my feet warm during class.   Using the socks my big toes were uncomfortably separated from the rest of my foot.  I expected more elastic.  They made my foot cramp during the class.  Because I had worn them once I could not return them.  Now I do not know what to do with them.  I should throw them out but I spent money on them

I got this watch to help me decrease my times for 5k, and it defiantly not 95% accurate.  I run ~10-11 minute mile; yet, both on the treadmill and outside, this watch was reading ~7.5 to 8 minute mile.  Distance was also off by +20%, when running.  

Speed and distance ~98% accurate for walking 15 min/mile.

I bought this unit two months ago and since that time I have used it sparingly. I went to turn it on today and it was dead. So I went out and bought a new battery and replaced the old one. Still dead. I tested the battery on a meter and it was full of juice, unlike this so called 'rugged' unit. A total waste of money, be forwarned

Have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed. If you move the compass (of your own choice or it falls off the windshield), you need to recalibrate it. I've been sitting at stop lights and seen a 10 swing of direction. I have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness

I should have heeded the bad reviews on this site.

I purchased this as a Christmas gift and tried to set it up for the recipient.  It was dead on arrival.

I tried a new battery, still dead on arrival.  Both batteries tested OK, clearly it's a dead unit.

I contacted the new manufacturer (NOT PNI as advertised) and am awaiting a response.

I can't recommend this product.

I bought this product on a Friday and arrived on a Thursday...Good shipping time but a horrible gun.  The pieces are hard to assemble and made of cheap plastic.  The whole gun was made of a cheap plastic which is not worth buying. I payed $30 for this gun and wasted my gift card for my birthday...Complete waste.  The laser's wires split, the gun does not shoot fully automatic and the FPS (feet per second) is slower than my Berretta Pistol.  Also the binoculars are cheap as well...it is just a gimmick to make you buy the product. Use your best judgement when buying this gun but it was not worth the $

My little girl was supposed to get this bike for her birthday (8/28) and due to missing parts. I was under the impression that i was buying a new bike not a used one. For the price i paid i should have gotten a new bike not a used bike that no one wanted. We have been having to go and order parts for the bike. The bike came with scratches and the bottles of paint that came with it were all dried out. The box that the bike came in was in horrible condition, it seemed as if it was left out in the rain for about a year. Then someone tried to tape the box together and ran out of tape. There were holes all over the place and i can see why i am missing most of the bolts and nuts.
We were very disatified and when i called to complain the girl who answered hung up on me. I am very unhappy and this will problaly be my last order with this comapny.

The overall steel frame and structure of it is good, but there are too many flaws with this product, I recommend going with something else.  

Flaws:  
1) Bands do not give you good increments of resistence.  If you want even resistance on each side, you go from 20 lbs to 40lbs in one setting, which is crazy.  

2) Workout and Assembly manuals are terrible.  Especially the Workout manual - what use is a machine if the correct use of it is not demonstrated?  What does that really say about how much Stamina cares about people using it correctly, without injury, and getting good benefit out of it?  Only about 10 exercises are really shown, the rest are just single pictures that let's you vaguely guess at what you are supposed to do, except that many are for some other machine, not this one. I'm sure someone will get injured from incorrect use.  

3) Many of the pictures are misleading, such that you can't actually do many of the exercises suggested or inferred by the pictures.  One customer service person told me the pictures were of some prototype machine.  Ridiculous. 

4) Several construction pieces I received were bad and caused problems, but replacement parts were shipped with no problem, albeit it meant waiting a week or so for each one, and then time to reconstruct the machine.  I had to replace the main Rail and a main leg support frame piece because they were both welded wrong.  

5) Leg padding is inadequate and painful

6) Doesn't seem to be a product that is understood or cared about by Stamina, no one I called seems to use it or really can tell you about it.

For a company that claims to care about health and fitness, they really don't show it with this product or support for this product.  I'd go elsewhere.

I bought this for my 5-yr-old, and he can't even get it on his head.  He wears other youth bike helmets, so I wouldn't recommend this item unless it's for a 2-3 yr old.  Now I have to pay half the price in return shipping

This bigwheel is so poorly made.  You have to affix the pedals and they do not stay on.  We put duct tape around the rod that holds the pedals on so they would stay.  The seat back has cracked already and we've only owned it one month.  The tassles on the handles don't stay in and the wheels are completely smooth so they offer no traction.  Lastly, there is no breaking mechanism.  Anyone who remembers riding a bigwheel knows that having a break is a must if you like to "skid out"!  Keep looking.

A real colorful and flashy bike, however there were several things wrong with it.
 1. the tires had so much excess rubber, it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed.
  2. The back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings. If not done, the bike would basically come to a stop by itself.
  3. the main (front) sprocket is slightly bent, so the chain falls off constantly.
  4. the bike if VERY heavy. maybe that makes it sturdy, but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride. 
I should have just bought a bike off the floor at Wal-Mart or Target for half the price

I ordered this Pilates ring because I had used one in my health club- big mistake.  It is plastic with little resistance and is totally useless.  Wouldn't even be of much use for a wheelchair-bound old lady.  (The vendor sent it fast though.

Well, first of all, I never folded it up, because it was very difficult to fold, so I would just roll it into a closet.  I would jump on it everyday for an hour and it was great low impact exercise.

I had it about 3 months and the suspensions snapped and I had a good shock as my feet suddenly hit the floor hard.  I weigh 110 lbs!  I really wonder how long this trampoline would last with a heavier person.

If I could give them 0 stars, I would.  I don't know why they even still make these, as they should be illegal--and so should all that laminated foam rubber stuff they use in karate.

The materials break up easily; the stuffing shifts and starts flying all over the place.  I could give tens of reasons why these are not only inferior, but complete garbage right out of the box.

Everlast in general simply isn't good: low quality materials, design and workmanship, but these win the prize for all time worst sports equiptment in my book.  

I recommend buying entirely Ringside--and this is coming from an experienced full-contact fighter

If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.

As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else

The description for this product states heavy gauge steel construction , but this only applies to the top section. The bottom straight section is made of cheap plastic . On top of that , of the 4 holes for the screws to go into mine had 2 of those stripped with a metal backing completely missing on one of them . Even the cheap logo stickers where placed completely off center , though that I could care less about.

If I had to do it all over again I would have purchased "Perfect Pushup" by Bodyrev which amazon sells

DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCTS FROM THE WESLO COMPANY. I just received my "Weslo Cadence C44 Treadmill" and have attempted to assemble it. The handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console. The Customer Service numbers are all disconnected. Their website gives an additional number to call, and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers, or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you. I have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them. This company is a complete scam. If you are even considering buying one of their products, your money is better spent getting your head checked

Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product

We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!  

Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars.

Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.  

Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor

Basically the title says it all.  I figured for a 100 dollars I would get a nice green and that the break would add to the challenge.  Basically this is a poorly made toy that shouldn't cost more than about 20 dollars much less a hundred.  Like I said in the title if you want an overpriced piece of junk then you hit the jackpot with the Tru-Break Putt 'n Hazard.  The only thing this is a hazard to is your wallet

I was disappointed in this product, and returned it - and bought "crank" type no-battery flashlights instead.  There were two things I disliked about the Diamond flashlight.  First, the light lasted a very short time - after shaking vigorously for a couple of minutes (they recommend just 90 sec. for a full charge), I turned the light on, and in less than 5 minutes it was very dim and almost useless.  I tried this a couple of times, with the same results.  The other problem was that shaking it for 90 sec. turns out to be a LOT more work than you would think!  I am much happier with both the light output and the ease of use with the crank type flashlights I replaced these with

Thi is HotImportToys at their finest. They are advertising this as a bullet(bb) proof mask for use in airsoft. That leads me to question why in the upper left corner it says "Not suitable for children under 3 years." Now, why would it say that? This mask is meant to be a toy, yet H.I.T is saying this will stop bb's. Don't they realize that by misleading people like this those people could be seriously injured, or even killed??? I think this really needs to be looked at by Amazon. This could seriously kill someone

I bought both the Nordic Gear batter-heated gloves and battery-heated mittens. Neither product provides adequate heat. The batteries work; but you get only a tiny bit of warmth. I see from the other reviews that my complaint is common. I wish I had read the reviews before buying

Battery powered gloves; little heat for a lot of money

I bought these gloves for my wife who has problems keeping her hands warm. The description of the gloves would have you believe that the battery powered gloves (using D cell Batteries) would provide heat to the hands for 6 to 8 hours.  In actuality, the battery will only provide heat for 35 to 40 minutes before it ends.  To make matters worse, the only heat provided is to the palm of the hand, no heat is provided to the fingers!

I did not use a cheap brand of battery for these gloves.  The first battery that I tried (it takes one D cell per glove) was Duracel with an experation date of 2013 (in other words, brand new battery with lots of shelf life left).  That battery provided heat for 40 minutes before dying.

The second set of batteries that I tried (with the same experation date) were made by Eveready.  That battery lasted 35 minutes.  You should also note that the Duracel fits poorly in the connector case and the Eveready battery fits even worse!

These gloves are on their way to Goodwill.  Maybe they can be used by some one as work gloves or something.  

If you are considering these gloves, think again!  The chemical packs work much better although they (the chemical packs) do have a shelf life.  It just seemed such a waste to us to use a chemical pack for a one hour walk and then have the pack continue to provide heat for another 4 to 6 hours.  Still, that is better than using up two D cell batteries for less heat that only lasts about 40 minutes.

I trained for a marathon and several 10K races using a heart rate monitor. They are very good instruments for training and I recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape. After you've purchased one or two of them, you become a better shopper. I purchased an F-4 for a friend, and I was very, very disappointed in the battery life when I found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out. Some of the newer heart monitors - Nikon for one- have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years

Not very bright for an LED.  AND, guess what? This is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes!
Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack.
I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this.

I was impressed by all the reviews that said that how quiet the machine was when I bought it.  Assembly was not so bad (2.5 hours).  Then the squeeking started.  Just about after 100 calories burned, there would be a two distinct squeeks at a specific position of the flywheel.  We called technical service and the service person called back on the 5th day (he needed to respond before 5 days) and scheduled a visit for a day 10 days AFTER that.  The technician inspected the machine and said that such sound was normal, and adjusted the tension on some screws and left.  Now the squeeking is starts right after beginning the workout.  It is LOUD.  As in, you need earplugs, loud.  Another call to tech support...

When I saw that most of the critical parts, the ones that bear the brunt of the force were made of plastic, I told my wife "this isn't going to last long."

In the very place I had concerns is where mine broke.  A simple metal pin, instead of a plastic one would have made all the difference.

I also just noticed in these "customer reviews" that right after someone posts a negative review, a positive albeit anonymous review is posted.  That always makes me wonder

The first time I used it, I hit it about 20 times before the ball broke off and went flying into nearby woods.

My Mom had ordered it from Sharper Image.  She called them and they said the would replace the ball.  They never did. 

I have not found a place to order replacement parts.

I don't recall ever being quite as disappointed with a product as I am with the Swing Groover II. Last night I went to the driving range to check some yardages of my clubs, just so I could verify the accuracy of the Swing Groover.  
  
 I was hitting my 5-iron between 180-190 yards most of the time, occasionally hitting 200. My 7-iron was flying about 165 yards. Tonight, I just finished setting up the Swing Groover. My first few swings with a 5-iron produced readings of 133 yards. I warmed up a little more and started hitting the 7-iron. These swings produced readings of 121 yards, with an average of 121. 
  
 This product is designed to indicate swing speed and yardage hit. The yardage is off by about 50 yards, but believe it or not, I think the swing speed indicator is probably pretty accurate. With the 5-iron, it was indicating a little over 70 mph. I've had my speed tested before with the driver and it registered a little over 100 mph, so this number of 71-73 with the 5-iron sounds reasonable.  
  
 I'm not sure if I just got a defective machine or what exactly the problem is, but I'm very disappointed. I'm very inclined to think I just wasted $150. 
  
 My suggestion is to keep looking for other products, because this one is horribly inaccurate

Hydrolized Gelatin is the 3rd ingredient after the chocolate coating and protein blend.  Do a search on that and you'll discover that it comes from processing pork skins and cow bones.  Mmmmm. Doesn't that sound good?  What's more - this gelatin protein is incomplete, so it doesn't really do anything to help grow or repair muscles.  It may taste OK, but you can find protein bars with higher quality protein in them. Or just eat Jello if you really want gelatin. 

Avoid ones with collagen too.  Same issue

While this is a cheap product and worked great for the first application/session use of 20 min, the second time I tried to use it the belt failed after 5 min.  Even after getting new batteries (which turned out NOT to be the problem) I tried to get the belt to work like before but realized I was "scammed".  It is a cheap plastic belt that seems to be the answer to all your problems but really just creates new ones

Yes, you'll feel your muscles contracting. If they were really contracting to a  degree worthy of being called exercise, the contractions would scare the heck out of you: You'd either feel like your whole core was paralyzed or you'd be going into an spastic, involuntary crunch. Don't worry, that won't happen. The machine isn't strong enough. (Try this: Tense up your abs..more..a little more...relax and do it again a few times, for a minute or so...thats already WAY more exercise than you'll get from the 'Ab Sonic'.) If you're a therapy patient who has a poor muscular awareness, perhaps this will help you begin to get enough feeling back to move on to a real exercise program. If your spinal cord is severed, this may be all you can do to get a little musuclar stimulation...fine. This is not exercise. It may 'remind' you to tense your abs in order to not look like a fat slob, but why not just remind -yourself-? It's not powerful enough to do do any real strengthening, and even if it was, it by-passes the most important part of your  workout: the will. You  aren't learning the effort of tensing the muscles, or tolerating greater stress, you're just electronically agitating the muscles. In the end, this has ZERO effect on strength, muscular development, work tolerance, and function. Are you in therapy? No? Then why are you trying -so hard- to avoid -moving- your body

I bought this item based on other people's reviews. I'm sad to say they were wrong. Maybe it's just my individual toy but it really did not work properly out of the box. The gun starts doublefeeding pellets as soon as I started firing it. It sprayed pellets in everywhich direction except for where they were supposed to go. My recommendation, well, just look at my title.

Let me just start by saying this gun is terrible. The images are misleading; the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic, but it is a dull black. And it smells really badly at first. Not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps, and is sold at 300. My friends didn't even notice being shot. I have a 300 fps pistol, it leaves welts through jeans. This ISNT 300 fps. It's a rifle fit for an infant who's been dropped on their head and thinks it's good. never even shot farther than 80+ feet. bad buy

I bought this elliptical three month ago unwilling to pay big bucks (over $1,000) for recommended models, hoping to make an exclusion from the rule.
No, it did not happened. Starting with the errors in assemble instrucions in the manual, inaccurate display readings, and so on, ending with a squicky and noisy piece of ... equipment.
Their customer service is just a place to order parts, although they sent me some parts I broke when assemling - a threat on the bolt, a couple of broken (by me) plastic part. I noticed that I'm using this machine more rarely because I just don't like the way it works.
If I new what I was going to get, I did not buy it

I bought this for my wife because of it's low cost. You get what you pay for. She uses it a few times a week. After a little more then a month, the left pedal broke. She is not overweight at all, so that wasn't the problem.
I'll spend the money for a good one next time

This is a very heavy machine so make sure you have help if it is going up the stairs.  It is fairly quiet, not silent.  It is shakier than I had hoped.  The wire to the monitor came broken.

I recently purchased the Stamina Elliptical. It took me a day and a half to put together. The meter didn't work so I called customer service and they sent another one out immediately. It makes a lot of noise and it's not very sturdy. I would return it but it would take too long to dis-assemble. I wouldn't recommend this product.

This imported 'sword' is actually a long dagger, about the size of a WWII-era bayonet.  In the scabbard it is all of 15 inches.  The construction, fitment of parts, finish, and overall quality is poor.  Definitely a mass-produced, low quality item.  The blade is plain stainless steel and would not hold an edge.  It would properly be labeled a "Masonic-ish" sword as the symbolism on the handle, guard, and scabbard do not strictly conform to those of any branch of Masonry.  There are prominent red crosses and a few Knights Templar-ish symbols but no one that knows anything about Masonry would mistake this for a genunine implement.

The blade is sharply pointed so this is NOT something children should play with!  It looks okay hanging on the wall (in the scabbard) but that is about all it is good for.  The price is not a bargain, it is about right for a Chinese-made import of this size and quality.

As long as you don't expect more that what I have described, you might like this item

If it is kept in the hilt, it makes for a decent wall piece.  If you pull it out of the hilt, it is not a good thing.

My sword has a bent blade, and a bent handle, which was noticable while in the hilt.

I would not spend the money on this item

If you need a "starter" or "disposable" bike carrier, this might be okay, but not suitable for longer trips or valuable bikes.

Good parts:
Cheap, $99

Bad parts:
1.  Cheap
2.  The adapter for a 2" reciever hitch is horrible, you'll have to shim it, jury-rig something, or go to a parts store and pay for a workable one.
3.  Way too much sway, which is obvious as you put it together.  Turning corners in town have you checking your mirrors with concern.  Multiply the effect for highway speeds or bumps.  Would need to rig something.
4.  Straps holding the bikes.  Cheap, rough on your bike, and not very tight.

In summary, if you want to spend alot of time rigging it up to save a few bucks, it might be worth it, but out of the box, I wouldn't trust any worthwhile bike or vehicle with it

I gave this product one star because it was the lowest option. What I really give it is this: WARNING! The outback hitchback 4 product is a dangerous piece of junk. I installed it on my Suburban (which required the - needs to be redesigned - adaptor to 2 inch) and put one full-sized and three kid bikes on it. It swayed a range of 10-12 inches newly installed. My wife  had went on the Target web site earlier and read that the sway was normal. By the time I had traveled 1/3 of the way back to the Bay Area from LakeTahoe (in the middle of the night) I noticed in the lights of the car behind me the hub of the full sized bike wheel sticking out from the side of the vehicle. I pulled over in the dark and checked it out. Due to the constant side-to-side motion of the winding mountain roads the main metal braket had bent and the sway had increased to a now dangerous 2 feet! Needless to say the rest of the four hour trip was nerve racking. Roping the rack to try and stabilize it. I'm taking the rack back to Target

The first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame.  Two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit.  The seller forwarded the photos and complaint to Texsport and they sent us another top.  When we put that top on we found the same thing.  That is when we found the frame was 4" longer than the top.  There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner.  After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together.  When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product

I got this Zafu(meditation cushion.) It is round in shape and too  high and bulky to be comfortable to sit on, around 9 inches high and 15-18 inches in diameter. It is also pretty heavy, around 4 pounds due to the sheer size.

I could not sit comfortably on it due to this reason returned it. I would recommend trying it somewhere before buying.

The filling seemed of good quality

I got this item to give a a gift.  I got it fast, however opened the bag to find out the zipper was completely broken.  It wasn't worth returning it because if you've opened it you can only get a 50% refund and have to pay shipping, which would have cost more than what I would have been refunded.  Don't bother with this one

The literature describes this unit as a flat-mount ski rack compatible with any factory-installed roof rack with crossbars.  Hardly.

My vehicle is a 2006 GMC Envoy with a factory roof rack.  This rack is the same one used on many GM SUVs, so great numbers of them are out there.  These racks have crossbars with a "reverse wing" shape that are tilted forward, presumably to reduce wind noise.  The Thule "universal" mounting system will not conform to these crossbars, and will only mount with the ski rack tilting forward (or backward) at a silly angle.  It can be used in this conformation, but it looks odd.

Also, the ski rack indeed locks over the skis/boards, but the mounts are not lock-protected, so the entire ski rack and contents can be easily stolen with standard wrenches.

My searches found no alternative to this rack, however, and it does work for the intended purpose

This is a $22 tee ball? Maybe they have the decimal in the wrong place, since these should cost about $2 at your local sporting goods store. Maybe they comes 10 or 12 to a package (but it doesn't say that clearly on the page).

Bottom line is don't buy this until they clarify the pricing issue

I was unable to use this treadmill for several reasons. One, the belt will not stay centered. It shifts to one side and then starts rubbing on the metal guides intended to keep it centered. If I were able to get the belt to turn with out a large amount of force, the second problem, it would soon be torn by the guides. As I said the second problem is the belt will not move without a lot of force. I had to lean over and put so much force down that after only 3 minutes my legs were cramping. If I tried to stand up and just walk normally the belt would not move. Also like others several of the plastic knobs were broken and it was either a used unit or the numerous scratches happened during shipping

This is the worst purchase I have made from Amazon or anyone else. The "first" unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable. After a number of calls to tech support, it was decided to return and replace the unit. Amazon promptly replaced the treadmill. This one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function. My friend at tech support did not have a clue. He suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit. It is not clear what I am to do with them. I strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer

This is not as described..it is very hard to move - heavy and bulky. If you have a place to set it up and leave it, fine, but this is not going to be pulled out every day for a 'stroll in front of the TV', as described.  Performance-wise it seems very nice and is a good solid piece of equipment, but definitely not an item that can be put away after each use.  I'm disappointed

The goal arrived at my house assembled wrong, then after it was fixed be me, I successfully put it together, which was relativly easy.  After several moderately hard training sessions two large holes were in the net.  That is on top of the fact that the pins that hold the net together are weak.  The weakness in the pins causes the goal to collapse if there is a shot off of the post.  Overall, this is probably not a good buy.

Prior to purchasing this item, I read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe.  I wish I heeded this advice because, on top of fasciitis, I developed severe toe pain by using this product.  I then had to by a second product anyway that, thankfully, eliminated the toe pain.  Even though this is less expensive than other night splints, it may do more harm than good.  Go with a firm, non-toe injurying splint instead

Maybe the S120 will work for you, but it was nothing but trouble for me.  I bought it because of the great features and price, but returned it because of all the problems: 1) The manual is anything but friendly, e.g. after completing the 11 steps to set the date you are then told that there's a short cut.  Thanks.  2) After spending much more than an hour with the manual just to get the basic settings in, I'm off to exercise.  Great start, the reading is my usual pulse around 55, then it drops out to 0.  Ok, maybe the contacts are too dry, so I wet them.  Off I go again and the pulse rate measures 204 then to 0.  Ok, maybe the chest strap is positioned poorly.  Different position, same result -- measured pulse rates all over the map.  I decide to forget what the monitor records and finish my exercise.  Final result -- I got periods of reasonable heart rates, but lots of time the values were either 0 or over 190.  The next day I try again with the same result -- drop outs and then sky high readings.  It went back later that day

I ordered the Igloo quick and cool 150 from Target. I had it 2 days after ordering. It was a very nice cooler but very clearly quite used. Back it went. Be careful ordering from Target in January. They have to do something with those Christmas returns. Check out the product carefully.

The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it

Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick. Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness. Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever. Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one

LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIGHT FLASHLIGHTS. 
THE PARTY THAT SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH CHARGE DURING SHIPPINS IS A LITTLE SHAKING IN THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF OF SHAKING BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A GLIMMER OF LIGHT. AFTER THAT IF YOU DON'T CONTINUE TO SHAKE IT DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY.
THIS LIGHT MAY POSSIBLY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE BUT THERE ARE OTHER LED FLASHLIGHTS WITH BATTERIES THAT ARE SUPERIOR TO THIS ONE. THE POWER USED BY THESE LEDS IS LOW AND THE BATTERIES LAST A LONG TIME.

I have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one.

This one puts out a a poor amount of light. It also does not retain its charge well.  You will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged.

I would say it is one of the worst ones I purchased

It holds my bike but seems unstable - I still can't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car, and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards.  Plus, probably the biggest concern - there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack (user must tie the bike down every time).  My bike hasn't fallen off though..

The light came without the batteries that were supposed to be included.  Batteries were very difficult to find and quite expensive.  Even with batteries the xenon light did not work.  So now I have a very expensive led flashlight with hard to replace batteries.  The case was nice however

If you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles, and pins while camping, then this is the item for you. The instructions are made only to confuse things more. It could be made so much more user friendly.

Not strong enough to hold even 2 gallons of water in a shower.  This is shown with a shower hanging in it but the only way it would hold it is empty.  Not usable as a shower.  Good if you are looking for privacy or changing room but not for a shower

I already have a good quality FitBall stability ball that I really like and only bought this set to get the DVD. I had planned to give the ball to a family member, but unfortunately it is of poor quality and not burst resistant, so it will probably just get thrown out.  The included pump is a piece of junk, so even if you do want to use the low quality ball, you'll need to find another way to inflate it.  Finally, Mindy Mylrea is a good instructor, but the music & sound quality were lacking and I ended up not liking the workout, so in the end I got rid of the dvd as well.

Now I am a firm believer that breakfast is a very important time in your day. Yesterday morning I was driving to the dentist's office when I realized that I had forgotten to eat. I started to have quite an anxiety attack, so I pulled over at the only available place. A Gas Station. Nothing really caught my eye as something I would like to put inside my body. Now this was no ordinary Gas Station. This was a special kind of one where they had hot food behind the counter, including supreme-pizza, chicken drum-sticks, and even breakfast-style food, like a little sausage-egg-buiscuit-combo-sandwich. Sure, the food smelled alright, but the thought sickened me that one of the mechanics or gas-pumpers may have had oil, grease, or even gasoline on their hands when preparing these dishes. While I was peering over the counter, trying to scope out just how filthy their hands were, something to my left caught my eye. 

It was a golden box of something called a "Powerbar". The name had me sold immediately (a food that creates power), and they were even individually sealed to prevent the repulsive hands of the workers from contaminating them. "I'm going to eat a POWERBAR" was the only thought on my mind as I purchased 4 of them on the spot. I hopped back in my VW Cabrio and sped off down Livernois towards the dentist's office. 

I unwrapped one of the Powerbars. It looked just like a normal candy-bar but the name told a different story. Just how much endurance and stamina would one of these provide, and for how long? What kind of advantages would I gain? I thought I had found my new favorite food. Finally, a food that defines Howard Tuttleman as a person. That is, until I took my first bite. 

My first bite literally took me 2 minutes to chew up enough to be able to work it down my throat. It was a tough rubbery nugget inside the chocolate that stretched out a bit like taffy. Every bite had the same grimy and bitter flavor, with an atrocious after-taste. My mouth felt like I had ingested a whole bottle of Elmer's glue, and every crevice between my teeth was gummed up with it. I reluctantly continued to eat the entire bar. My stomach began to feel as if I had eaten lead. I felt no extra power in my body. If anything, the Powerbar significantly weakened me by making me feel ill. I was convinced that I had simply picked a bad Powerbar, so I unwrapped another one to give it a second chance. By this time I was in the Dentist's parking lot. If I went in now, I could make the appointment on time, but I had to try for more Power. Big mistake. The second Powerbar was no different. It felt like the Powerbars were fighting my stomach. I finished the second Powerbar, feeling even worse. 

My third Powerbar however was the worst of the bunch. It was a different flavor, and I nearly threw-up. I felt 20 pounds heavier. My teeth and lips felt like I had been eating drywall, and were covered in chocolate and grimy nugget. I simply could NOT eat more than 2 bites of the fourth one, no matter how much I tried. It was time to go inside. 

My dentist was a little ticked-off that I was late, and got really annoyed about all of the Powerbar remains stuck in my teeth. Apparently I wasn't supposed to eat for a while before my appointment. I felt sick for the rest of the day. I gave my dog (Morris) the rest of the 4th Powerbar to see if it would work on a dog, but it just made his butt really powerful that night and was a real pain to clean up after. Please beware, the name of this product is deceptive, unless it is supposed to mean that the Powerbar ITSELF is powerful, and will overpower YOU. Later.

I am disappointed with this product as I thought I was ordering the stretchout strap which is all nylon and very durable which I give to my patients. This one is made of nylon and elastic. The stitching broke within 2 days of minimal use. The elastic may be more comfortable on the hands but the stitching is poor quality and just fell apart. Go with the Stretch Out Strap which I have been very pleased with

how can this table be used with FACE HOLE?
either -- 
1) use no sheets, ie client lies directly on vinyl, 
  or 
2) fitted sheet covers hole, ie client cannot breathe.
Neither of these 2 options is even remotely acceptable

We have in the past owned an In Step single jogger.  It wasn't perfect but it certainly met our needs.  It always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside.  If we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it.  After being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling.  We purchased the In Step Run Around LTD 2 Jogging Stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs.  The problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller.  My husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break... it doesn't stop the stroller and barely even slows it down.  It took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger.  After that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride.  When placing them in we encountered our next problem... the seats even at the highest point are super reclined.  They wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other. As for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle. So off we set on our test drive.  It was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn.  After a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger.  The only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position, criss-cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell "Stay down kids...if you sit up one more time I'm going to sit in it and make you push me!"  Well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart.  I don't recommend this item.  In all honesty our Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon does the job more effectivel

We know strollers!!  This is our 5th stroller over 4 kids.  We decided to try a dually.

Pros:
Plenty of room for 2 children both about 25 pounds.  "Cute"

CONS:
We're reviewing what we consider to be an expensive stroller.  In our opinion the added expense shouldn't equal just an extra seat, but better design and higher quality.

1)  While the dimensions are listed in the description, the relative size to every day objects are not discussed.  Objects, like say, doors.  This stroller won't fit through 90% of the doors in the world.  You basically had better only expect that it go through the front door of your house or plan on Parking it in the garage next to your suburban.  The doorway must be a 3'0 door (36  inches wide).  That's usually only your front door.    Forget about pushing into or out of any interior doorways which are generally much smaller.
2)  The straps are awful.  Again, our 4th stroller.  Worse one of all.  Incredibly, incredibly difficult to use.  I'm actually flabergasted at how difficult the straps are.  Despite having tightened them up as tight as possible, the two year old was out in under 10 minutes (once she decided to be out).
3)  Impossible to allow the children to sit up.  Again, adjusting the straps to the utmost, the angle of the backrest remains extremly steep.  Perhaps to counter balance the lack of effective straps?
4)  Hand brake is setup for the left hand.  Appears to be reversible if you want to work on it.
5)  Hood can not be lowered to cover front of children.  If say, you are walking into the sun (morn or evening), the kids are completely exposed.

Conclusion:
Very frustrating buy.  Wouldn't recommend it at all

This was one of our worst purchases. Rental gear that we have used on previous vacations works better! The snorkle and mask were constant problems, leaking, filling with water, etc. We had to stop snorkling every few minutes and finally just gave up.

If your looking for cheap snorkel equipment this is the way to go, but the fins are low quality and I would only wear them if I wanted to get laughed at

the jacket works well for shedding water which isn't really losing positive weight. the pants rip during the first work out. i've purchased two of these hoping in good faith that the pants woouldn't rip. but they did. save your money unless you just want to jacket.

The suit will make you sweat if that's what you are looking to do.  I had rivers running out of my sleeves and pant legs, but the pants tore within weeks on the inside seam.  I was using the suit about 5 times a week with a vigorous treadmill routine.  It will likely last longer and be fine for occasional recreational uses, but buy something more substantial for a serious workout.  You truly do get what you pay for

 I received the exercise bike, put it together as soon as I got it,  and started using it. Just looking at it I had second thoughts about buying it. Ten minutes later it broke. Some part in this cheaply made product broke on the inside. I contacted the guys who sold this to me to get my money back but they never got back to me.
 One more thing. Even if it hadn't broken, the resistance setting on this thing is horrible. You get absolutely no resistance on it. That means no workout

Received the bike in our office as a possible incentive for our wellness program and no one was able to use it.  You can't get it to pedal.  The cheaper way is not the way to go on this type of bike.  You need a heavier base and very smooth cycling.  This model runs on a fabric type band on the inside. MADE VERY CHEAP.  I DON'T RECOMMEND
