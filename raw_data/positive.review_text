I received my Kingston 256MB SD card just as advertised.The unit came in the mail exactly 2 days after Iordered. Worked perfectly and I'm very satisfied
Works well, especially for anyone who still has their old console systems in use. I have my NES and SNES, both of which have huge AC adapters, plugged into this. It saves tons of space on my power strip.The design is a little clumsy though, so it's only getting 4/5
Not as easy to use as a larger Panasonic I used to own butotherwise fine. Good sound.  Using CD player and radio.Buying via Amazon as usual is super
It worked much better than expected. The page clips also were very good, but one fell off about 5 minutes into owning/using the item (I put it back on, but fell off a couple more times). I also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well.
It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin. 
I've had a number of universal remotes over the years and each has had pluses and minuses to offer. The monster remote is a very effective universal remote on all accounts but there is ONE thing that stands out here above all the other remotes. Wireless control over lighting. I replaced my dimmers and switches with the Monster dimmers and switches and now I can control every light in my house. Monster really doesn't talk much about this feature but being able to hit "ALL OFF" at night on my way to bed and have the remote turn off all the house lights is killer. You can even map ligthing scenes to activities. If you hit watch a movie it can turn down the ligths at the same time. Really cool. Good job monster.
I really don't have much to say about this book holder, not that it's just a book holder.  It's a nice one.  It does it's job.  It's a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic.It's strong, sturdy, and it's big enough, even for those massive heavy textbooks, like the Calculus ones.  Although, I would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that's like 6" thick (even though it still may hold).  It's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place, although those tend to fall off when you move them.  But that's no big deal.  Just put them back on.  This book holder is kind of big, and I would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom, but it's not too big.  You should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time. 
After using my iM716s for about 4 months now I have a few things to say about them.1) Price: Lists for $199 on Altec's site.  $70 is a steal.2) Quality: Top notch in the earphones, the clip on the volume module is weak.3) Performance: Bar none best I've had.  These things outperform the huge Logitech ear muff set I use mainly to mow in.  These things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower.4) Conclusion: The only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way.  When moving around, you NEED to have it clipped to something, otherwise it can create inner ear noise.  This can get quite annoying.  I've also caught the cord on things, causing the clip to bend away from the module.  It is removeable and I was able to bend it back.  If there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module, even for the same price, I'd go that route.  With that said, I am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60GB video ipod
This is perfect for my iPod and keeps it totally secure while driving.  Great price and you get different sizes to match your car perfectly. 
Always something that might come in handy my last remote quit working after a year
This CF card is so fast that I can run my shutter on my camera non stop until the card is full at a frame rate of 3.5 fps. No lag or slow down. That is amazing. It makes my camera perform better. (Canon Rebel XT
I installed this unit on my HP AMD 64 X2 with a 19-inch LCD monitor.  Installation was very straightforward, with no problems experienced.  The unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total.  All are surge protected, but only one row has battery backup.  Each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets.  The unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line, and interacts well transparently my DSL service.The unit comes with a USB connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer.  Also included is "PowerChute Personal Edition" software.  This software replaces the UPS option used under the "Power" icon of Widow's XP Control Panel.  PowerChute PE allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user's needs.  PowerChute PE automatically loads at computer startup, and resides as an icon on the right-side of the Window's task bar.  It monitors the unit's status, and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference.In order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly, I only attached the PC and monitor to the powered row of outlets.  Transformers seem to use a lot of power, and to gain the most time available for adequate shut-down times they should only be plugged into the "surge only" outlet row.When A/C power fails, the unit immediately picks up the power load.  It will then begin to shut down the PC if A/C power does not become available shortly .  The default method it uses is to place the PC into "hibernation mode", saving the desktop exactly "as is" for future start-up.  It accomplished this task with my PC perfectly.If I had wanted a UPS to keep my computer running for several minutes during an A/C power outage, this is not the unit I would have purchased.  However, to keep my system from re-booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily, or to shut down the PC safely should the power outage last longer, this is a cost-effective solution for those tasks.
I used it in Brasil and had it developed.  I was very happy with it.  It was the very first time I've used a digital camera
I had two unworking disks (One a PS2 game and the other a PSX game) so I picked this up and both work fine now! The only thing is you'll have to run it through a couple times. If you run it through once you'll see little difference... But for the price and since it does work... eventually, I still give it a 5 out of 5.
What an amazing product for such a small price.  It works right out of the box, but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers.  The option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday PC work as well using the pen for graphics.  I use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures.  It really makes a difference.The unit seems well made and I like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice.  I opted for the smallest in the range for value, and was not disappointed, but I am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better, but at cost.The software bundle is ok too if you don't already have photoshop tools.The one quibble is that at home when I installed the drivers it continued to crash my PC with my wireless keyboard installed.  Not ideal, but as I dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me, but be careful, I am sure there will be a fix somewher
I like it very much, I use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather. I would buy Kingston again
I got this card last month and I've been using it heavily. Its been great. Its sturdy and can has great range. There are a few problems though.#1 There is no case for the card.#2 The included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible. Luckily I had NetFront 3.1#3 Memory Stick LAN software will occasionally error, but a soft reset will fix it.Otherwise its a great little expansion card
I love my tooldial and its' software.  My only complaint is that you must have a very large proccessor to run it effectively.  I frequently find that it gums up photoshop and in-design a little.  Overall great product and I expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs.  Works very well in tandem with a WACOM tablet
This is a great card reader for the price. Why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have? Personally, I only use CompactFlash and SD cards. It reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably.The shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards, which you'll want to do a bit carefully. It would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk. Remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the Sandisk logo on the card reader. It is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first, but once you get the feel of it, it beccomes quite easy and routine.This Sandisk has LED indicators that are helpful. One Amber LED to tell you the unit is connected to your USB, and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert (solid green), or that it's reading or writing (blinking green).This card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and I feel it represents a good value. I would recommend it
The Sandisk reader is impossible to misuse. It loads quickly and it's compact shape offers most options for memory. It can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet. I would prefer a little more weight so that it doesn't move around on my desk so I'm giving it only 4 stars. If I had to replace this reader, I would buy another SanDisk
I agree that these are not top of the line. But they aren't bad at all. I get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media.I always burn at half the speed the media is designed for - 2x in this case. It takes longer, but I get good results. I am rarely in a hurry to burn a DVD.I would buy these again.** Updated on 7/3/2005 **I have bought a new computer recently and I have been burning these DVDs with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what-so-ever. Very happy with this product
I, like many other people that have written reviews here, researched the purchase of an MP3 player in great detail.  Other members of my family own iPods, and that is the direction that I was heading until I did a massive amount of research.  If you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on CD, this is the unit that you want.  iPod will not let you download your own songs, I did not know that until after I purchased this player (thankfully).  This unit was the highest rated unit by far that I was able to scour the internet for.  If this is your first purchase of an MP3 player (like mine) buy this one, no questions asked.  Do not worry about trying to buy $80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal.  Crisp, clear, awsome base and I have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40.  I cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing.  I received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when I got home from work and by 6:35 I have transfered the 114 artists folders (about 4,000+ songs) that I had ripped on my computer last week (about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player).I would recomend buying the cradle, it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo, which I plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool.Absolutley buy this unit.  I have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and I have a high performance expectation and it has met it
I bought this keyboard originally for the LCD screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games I play.  I was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an LCD hanging off of it.  It's the best-feeling keyboard I've ever owned.  The keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate, and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature.  The backlighting is bright, day or night, and the programmable G-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past.  Highly recommended
I'm very happy with the set.  Although not listed in the specs, it must have a QAM tuner, because I am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all I have is basic cable.  I was thrilled when I made this discovery.  Watching football games in HD, without paying for digital cable, almost made me weep with happiness.The picture quality for analog channels is only so-so.  I really wish the remote was illuminated.  Also, Amazon took much longer to deliver the TV than was promised.  Other than these negatives, I'm very happy
We have the original Itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in. The originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station. After reading the instructions I plugged the new Itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals. Not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away. That is better than I expected after reading all the feedback. I'm not sure what everyones problem is. It's not a radio tower, it's a transmitter the size of your finger. I get the feeling that some people think it should power the City block.
I have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance. The Disaster Recovery software provided with this drive is it's biggest star. You can format your hard drive, put in the restore disk that you create for your system, and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to EXACTLY the way it was when you created the disk. Or you can simply replace selected files if you want. It does not miss a single thing. Fanstastic. The software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an ABC book. I would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use
Works great!!!  I have a flat roof that does not allow me to add a phone line and the only way to use my satilite system is with a long phone cord accross my room.  This jack extension helped me eliminate the long ugly cor
Ok, I got this as gift so I got nothing to lose right!  Well, this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i gotta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle.Ever since I unpacked this little thing, it has been with me everywhere!  On the go, exercise, sleeping....anywhere you have pockets to put it, ipod shuffle is always with me whenever I needed some kick of tunes, its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 GB of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime, it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me...lol!  Sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer/update tunes on the go.  So if you are a fast paced, mobile and not a control freak, then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it
If you own a Canon digital camera this printer is great.  It is portable and makes great prints.  People think they are from a photolab.  It is also vey easy to use.  I have seen other mini printers from Olympus and Sony and they are not as good.  They cost more too
I recently purchased this as a replacement for my Monster Cable.  I must say that I am quite impressed.  This is the best FM transmitter I have encountered.I live in Seattle.  There is a fairly saturated FM dial, and the unique topography of the surrounding area has a tendency to deflect certain signals.  That said, I only have minor problems with interference, the most common of which is moderate distortion in the upper ranges.Functionality is pretty much seamless in my car.  I drive a 2003 Ford Focus.  The 12v power jack is position to the left of my in dash CD changer, so accessibility is not an issue.If anyone is in the market for an FM transmitter for their iPod, I highly recommend this one.  "That'll do, pig.  That'll do.
Overall a very nice charger, though recharge times aren't even close to what is advertised.  The display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair.  The 900 mAH hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless.
Title: Intuos3 TabletPublisher: WacomPublish Date: UnknownISBN/Model #:  PTZ631WReviewer: Robert SaucierRating: 5 starsIn 1997, after buying a new top-of-the-line 450MHz Pentium II system, I splurged on a Wacom ArtZ II tablet.  Oh, my!  Pressure-sensitive, tilt-sensing, pointer control, assignable function pads; it was Heaven.After a couple of years, every time I tried to use it with my primary graphics application, my computer would spontaneously reboot -- a bit counter-productive.  I watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but, as technology marched on, my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats.Sadly, I disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away.  Lately, I've been feeling the pull once more, that urge to use a pen to do photo touch-ups instead of my mouse.  Miraculously, a Wacom Intuos3 6-inch by 11-inch tablet dropped, almost literally, into my lap.  Sleek, gun-metal gray, sexy -- with a comfort-grip pen (much like my coveted Pilot G2 pens) AND a mouse!  Even better, the Intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities:  Adobe Elements 4.0, Corel Painter Essentials 3, and nik Color Efex 2.0 lE.  Heaven just got better!The Intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution, over twice that of the Wacom Graphire product line, and, with its USB 2 connection, there's more than enough communication bandwidth, meaning better tablet to application response.  One hesitation I have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system; will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else.  The Intuos3 driver has been rock-solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me.  I've used all of my "usual" programs and have had no problems at all.  The tablet has also been peacefully co-existing with two external drives, a wireless desktop receiver, a card reader, a scanner, and a printer, all riding the same USB bus.The Intuos3 has 8 "chordable" buttons, 4 at each side of the tablet, to which keys, macros, or other actions may be assigned.  The default for each group are the usual ALT, CTRL/Command, and Shift, along with "space".  The placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet, holding one or more of the buttons, while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand.  Being chordable, you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like ALT-CTRL-S or To the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well.  The default setting is to scroll or depending on the context.  The ends of the strip, in keystroke mode, can be set to playback macros.  The pen, with its 1024-level pressure-sensitive stylus AND "eraser," also has a DuoSwitch.  The DuoSwitch's two positions may also be programmed.The pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib -- there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback.  With the ergonomic grip, the pen is extremely comfortable to hold.  The 5-button mouse, designed to be used by either "righties" or "lefties," is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility, this is more than acceptable.  As with every other clickable/pressable feature associated with the Intuos3, the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options, although I've yet to find the "fix photo,"  "illustrate article," or even the "design website" settings.I can see only two very minor changes that I would make to this fantastic product.  I would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen.  It is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already, this feature would be the feather on the cap to me.  The other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the Graphire (and was on the ArtZ II).  Sometimes, having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time.For the casual home user, I would recommend the Graphire product line -- this Intuos3 model's SRP of $369 may be a bit high where a $99 entry point on the Graphire is more affordable.  For the pro-consumer or professional, however, whether doing photo editing (my primary use) or illustration, the Intuos3 line is well worth the investment.  It's great to be in Heaven again ...
I bought the Sansa M240 two months ago and am quite happy with it. It's light-weight, holds plenty of media (I have yet to fill it up) and the sound is suprisingly good. No complaints
The other effusive reviews are spot-on...  the picture is fabulous on new DVDs (Lord of the Rings, Nemo, Harry Potter).  A $20 Cables to Go HDMI cable does a great job.  We have the  Sony KDF-42E2000 42" 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV and are thrilled with the combination.  A few annoyances:  The machine responds and loads slowly, but that's not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.  And, certain DVDs of old movies (Some Like it Hot, The King and I) stretch the picture horizontally, making things look squat.  I'm sure there's a solution, but just can't figure it out.  Any tips
I bought this item, since I always make a lot of notes from books and other papers, and don't want to type it in manually anymore. This scanner, probably like any other model, needs a little training to get it right over the paper, but once done, it really works and faster than typing!I dont use the addressbook or options with your GSM but they are no doubt very handy.I just scan in from papers, and beam it to my laptop. Both Infrared and the cable work. The cable is especially great for using the scanner 'live'on the screen: the scanned text appears on the pc as you type!The dictionary also comes in very handy.It must be a very complex product, but just like the Ipod or ZenXtra mp3 players: they work!So buy one and save some time! Excellent and recommended for anyone that needs to make notes, or studies, or just wants to stop cutting out pages in newspapers in a train e.g
As your DVD/CD collections grow, these are ideal for protecting and storing your "treasures". Easy to open and take up little storage space. The center lock tab is secure but allows you to remove the discs from the case with ease.Just a great product
Excellent value -- these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price.  If you use a lot of AA's, this is the way to go -- made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the $18 range
Very pleased w/item.  Compact.  Easy to move from place to place
I bought this to clean up all of my kids DVDs. They have a ton of discs that are dirty, scratched, etc. I have cleaned over 30 discs so far and have fixed all but one (it was *really* scratched up).I am suprised at the negative reviews on this item since I have considered this one of my smartest buys this year
Just wanted to echo what others have said, that these batteries seem to really last.  I received a new camera and was using generic rechargeable batteries in it, almost as powerful as the 2500s here, and the batteries ran out after a few hours.  Replaced those batteries with these, and these just seem to last on and on.  Am very happy with them
You really can't go wrong with this one.  Not great response but what do you expect for less than $300?  On the other hand, The possibilities for this surround system are endless.  Want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen?  How about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system, (this is how my daughter has it configured).  It's our second one.  First one died as a result of recent electrical storm, (Yes the circuit was 'protected', but so what).  Couldn't be happier for the investment
This appears to be a good piece of equipment. I hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well.
The service from Amazon was great, delivery people were most cooperative, made delivery as promised, placed TV in space where we wanted and hooked up and checked it out.They even offered to take away the empty carton. We saved about $250 by buying from Amazon rather than from local retailer
If you want a budget home theater system for under $200 there is probably not many systems better then the Sony HT-DDW700. This system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room.Considering the price, sound quality is actually better then expected for me. The tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity. They may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't and are a bit heavier then they look. The center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low. The surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though.If set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well.Some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin. They are fixed and can't be replaced. Also, if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you. The 8" subwoofer is okay considering the price of the system. It is currently better then any other sub included in a home theater system under $200. It isn't powered, is very light (only 9 lbs) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass. The volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls. The receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs. It should be enough in most cases. An extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again the system is under $200. Setup couldn't be easier. You just hook up the included microphone, place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote. The system will automatically sets up the speaker distance, delay and volume levels. The receiver comes with the basic pro logic II music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources. It also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they don't really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all.Basically, if you want a home theater system for a small room and for under $200 then there isn't much better then the Sony HT-DDW70
I've owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen, useful shortwave and portable radios, stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders.  I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).PLUSES: decent soundgood functionalityeasy set-up and intuitive operationsimple remote -- but only covers basic functionsCONS:very short speaker leadsunattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boomboxonly holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic unitsAt first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven't blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.I originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).  This Sony stereo costs half as much, and has almost all the same functionality
The silicone is great quality, fits the nano snugly, and the arm band is nice.  Wonderful product, does what it's supposed to do, for a fabulous price. Recommended
I bought this 2 years back and still it is in great shape. Recently i forgot compact flash in my shirt pocket and went for washing and then followed by Drying. My wife found compact flash in dryer and i thought it would not work. Surprisingly it is working fine and i could see my past snapshots with out any problem.
It does everything I expected to do. Easy manual and set up. Great sound. I am keeping it
I am very pleased with this item. It is fits comfortably, holds my CD player snugly and has room for my ID, keys, extra batteries  CD's
After looking around at the local stores (Fry's and CompUSA) I had just about given up on finding a single case that would offer reasonable protection for my iPod in multiple environments - on my belt and also in exercise, and had resigned myself to having a "skin" type case for just everyday use and then shifting the iPod to an arm band for exercise. Not a particularly great solution - expensive (around $20 for each) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses.Then I ran into the DLO Action Jacket at Best Buy, which seemed to cover all my intended uses. Unlike the prior reviewer, I found my 40g iPod fits VERY snugly - absolutely zero slop, and I really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one case. Also, at $29.95, it's cheaper than the two-case approach. The only criticism I have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the case and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the case. The process is a little tedious, but the end result is great. The unit feels very secure on my arm and it's easy to forget that it's there.This jacket is a winner
We've had this printer for almost two years. I do a good amount of printing, both color  b/w. While I do need to do cleanings more often with this printer, mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all. And it is very affordable. Photos don't always print well... the only photo paper I have found to work well with my S530D was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when I bought it. No other photo paper has done well at all, so I suggest theirs. This is the best printer we have had in 10 years, and belive me I've thrown my share out the window! I can offer THIS advice to owners of ANY printers. Always use the power switch ON THE PRINTER to turn it on off, never use the power strip switch, or the switch from properties. For some reason doing so supposedly wastes ink? I don't get it, but I've always followed that advice and this printer has been an absolute gem for us. Good Luck! Jeanni
I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice
I am extrememly happy with this one.  For the price, it delivers well.  The voice recorder works well.  My key need was to record lectures and listening to them.  Worked out very well
I've been a gamer for almost 20 years.  This is the best mouse I've ever owned.  It is fast, accurate, well formed and constructed.  I would definitely recommend it.The DPI adjustment is a nice touch.  I prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy, this mouse is just right
I have two seperate units.  One hardwired to my car, and the other is the JVC unit.  I hooked it directly into the audio (aux) ports of my Radio, rather than use an fm station.  It works great, the sound quality is excellent as well - (and my radio is so old it play's 8-tracks!!!!).  I did notice that the unit tends to run a bit warm to hot.  I agree with the previous reviews, that it is something that JVC needs to look into, perhaps it is simply a matter of a "heat sink-er" not being in specs, as yet, I have encountered no problems (having had the JVC unit for 1.5 years)  No matter.  As to the commercial free: Sirius (which I have had a subscription to for the past 4 years) has commercial free radio, though the news stations and a few others do have commercials.  Those stations are clearly defined as being in the commercial block.  The music stations are 100% free of commercial. All in all a damn cheap price to pay for avoidance of all those really irritating DJ's, commerical's, and lack of variety in stations!  ~Cheers!
I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended
IT's a USB hub. All I ask is that it works. It does.
Is it expensive?, yes it is!!!However, I was conecting my Ipod mini to my speakers with two cables, mini jack cable and power cable and it was very unconfortable to do every day. The dock is a great solution for this issue. Now, I just insert the Ipod mini in the dock. Easy, fast and confortable. Additionaly, I can read easyly the song I am listening to
Quick reader, poor design. It does a great job copying images to my Mac, but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo-poo. It stays on tight, which is good, until you try to open it. The force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball-groove hinges useless. It's only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off, leaving the reader exposed to the elements
I purchased the Adorama Slinger Bag after first purchasing the Tamrac Velocity 5.  The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona).The Adorama Slinger Bag is a great travel bag. It is light weight and has great utility.  I highly recommend it.
Great for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your Ipo
I've never had any problems with Memorex DVD's or CD's. When I was ordering and read some of the reviews here, I had to go back and look at what I was using to make sure. I've always taken it for granted and only posted this review to counteract some of the negative ones. I don't know why some users are having problems, but these DVD's always worked great for me, and I record on average over one a day
I agree that this drive can be a little slow, but it hasn't caused a problem for me. I keep copies of many files (about 1 GB total) related to a large project at work on mine. When I first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes, but now I just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that I don't even notice them (just a second or two). I also seemlessly work on the files on both a PC at work and a Mac at home. To me the best feature is the reliability. Between my husband and I, we've had several Cruzer Minis in various sizes and each one has worked great, even through accidental abuse. One of his 512 MB drives accidently went through the washing machine. We thought the data was gone, but when it dried out, it worked fine. Just today I found my 2 GB drive at the bottom of the dryer; it had been left in a pocket and had gone through both the washing machine and dryer. Yep, it still worked! I'm buying a new one to replace it (just in case) because I don't know it there might be some long-term effects from the water and heat, but I'll keep using this one for less important applications. Changes are good, though, that it'll never have a problem. These things are amazingly reliable
I recently ordered this for a week long trip I was planning to Olympic National Park.  WOW what a great find.  I didn't have to worry about how many pictures my memory card would hold and could just snap away.  I think it also increased my shutter speed too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and have actually
I bought these as a gift for my husband to watch TV late at night without disturbing me.  He loves them.  The sound is fine and the headphones are comfortable. 
The Nike+ system has really been a good motivator for me. As a new runner, I need all the motivation and positive reinforcement I can get. The challenges and goals are a good way to keep on track as well.I didn't buy the Nike+ shoes - I use mine with the Marware Sportsuit Relay set up. It's a great system and a lot cheaper than spending $100 for a pair of running shoes when I already have a couple good pairs in the closet. Both products are highly recommended
I've had this card for about 1 1/2 years now and it has performed flawlessly. It has seen thousands of photos (no exaggeration!) on my digital camera and now holds data/mp3s for my palm too. Did you know you can pop your SD card out of a camera and into a palm to view photos? I just learned this. Anyway it's a nice product and I'm about to get another SimpleTech with 512 megs or higher if they have one. If you are new to SD memory, always get more storage than you need because eventually you'll buy something that will use one (camera, handhelds, cell phones, etc. -- note that many cell phones use a smaller "MiniSD")
This is a perfect mp3 player. I had the 40Gb model before this and needed a bit of extra room. You can't ask for anything more than this. It does everything an mp3 player should, and more (podcasts, videos, photos). I bought the 60 a couple of weeks before the 80 was released at the same price. Bad timing on my behalf..
Great price for a 128MB jump drive, works perfectt for my daughters college work, such a good price I bought 
This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk
I bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my Nikon D70 and I've certainly had no regrets. I haven't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write, but it's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in single-shot mode. The card is always ready when I am. Downloading from the card to computer via my SanDisk Imagemate is fast too.I like it so much, I'm buying a second one today
Must say that the item was better than I expected. Thanks to the seller and will buy again!!!
I bought this system recently after my Panasonic DVD Surround System broke. I was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on Amazon and other sites for that matter. But I couldn't find anything like this value and decided I could just take it back if I didn't like it. Well, I love it! The sound is great! Subwoofer is awesome! I do not hear a hissing noise at all. This sounds so much better than my Panasonic which broke and that I had paid $100 more for
I have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on.  Op/Tech came up with the solution!  All you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go.  Super easy to take off, putting on takes a little more time, but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway.  Basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt, water, etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots.  It is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used
 I had owned an LG burner and from the time I got it, it never worked right. I must have made 60 or 70 coasters before I decided that it was'nt the media, it was the crappy LG brand burner. I was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good, but as I found out with my LG experience, that is not always true.  My brother has an older model Sony burner and although his is slow, it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it, so I took a chance and purchased the Sony DRU-810A. That was the best decision I could have made. I will never buy another brand burner other that Sony brand. I have had this burner about 7 or 8 months. I am a very heavy burner and I have not made one coaster.  One thing I loved about my brother's Sony burner is that I could use any brand of media. The same thing is true of the DRU-810A. I don't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is. This burner loves everything. I had looked at the Plextor brand, but I did'nt want to pay $100.00 and I looked at NEC brand, LiteOn, BenQ. etc., but I am so happy that I passed on them all and got the Sony. It burns super fast. Some people say that it is loud, but it's not loud to me. I got my burner from Tiger Direct for $50.00. My sister's computer came with a crappy LG brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too, so for Christmas I am buying her a Sony DUR-810A so she can finally burn some movies. For my money, this is the best burner bar none.
I bought it for my Canon S3 IS. First I tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems. Then I did the suggested format by Canon and it worked the same: perfect. Fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera; haven't any problem of corruption. I've been tempted to buy another one. 
I read the other reviews on this bookholder and wasn't so sure about it.  However, after buying and trying it out, I have no regrets.  Don't know why I waited soo long to get one (dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one).  Although made of plastic, it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding.  The clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold.  Unlike other models, this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books.  I have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem
Look, for a bargain-basement product, what do you expect?  First, you expect it to work, and I can confirm it definitely does work.When plugged in to USB, it signals XP correctly.  The driver software is very tolerant.  You can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device.  So installation is a 5 minute process.Next comes the capture and initial encoding.  Well, the software is a bit lame as far as features and GUI.  Typical.  But it absolutely saves in MPEG2 / DVD format just as you'd need it to for making DVDs of all your Dish Network or PS2 or VHS content.  The frame rate is full on 30 fps.  It takes an SVIDEO or standard RCA video signal.  Both are just fine in quality.  The resolutions are not that great... but its passable for DVD when you crank it up.  Don't think you can encode some Blu-Ray quality MPEG with this though.As far as the overall durability of the product, I've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight.  It gets hot, but its never so much as flickered or needed reset.  Bottom line?  This thing is like a kids toy- its cheesy but tough as nails.  Get it for your first analog signal MPEG encoder.  Its a good value.
The cheapest option I found at the time but an excelent pen drive. Small and with a good style
I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone.I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future.
I thought when I up graded to the plasma things couldn't get any better I was wrong the wireless is the cherry on top I love this thin
This is a good compact flash card.  This is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive. 
GREAT ITEM, POWERED OFF LAPTOP ITS FANS WORK QUIETLY TO KEEP LAPTOP COOL. SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY US YOUR LAP, WITHOUT FEAR OF OVERHEATING YOUR COMPUTER. AN INEXPENSIVE SOLUTION TO PREVENTING COSTLY REPAIRS. WISH I'D PURCHASED EARLIER AS I ALREADY FRIED MY CD/DVD DRIVE AND HAD TO REPLACE THEM. GOOD PRODUCT TARGUS

Works like a charm, the Wi-Fi sniffer in the software is definitely a big plus ! You can get details of the connection i.e. connection strength, AP name and etc. Worth every penny 
I purchased this product 2 years back and it is still working without any problem. I use the batteries mostly for my digital camera and have no complaints so far. Highly recommend this product
The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures.  When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. 
My DVD player was ready to be thrown out, until I saw this product on amazon.  My DVD player wouldn't even load a DVD.  It kept saying "please check disc". After loading this disc, my DVD player has worked perfectly ever since.  Don't spent $30 on one of these "clean up discs". This one does the job
This memory card reader worked like a charm for me.  We've used both SD and Sony memory sticks in it with absolutely no problems
This card has all of the memory space required for my personal use. I would recommemd it to others
Overall this is a very good remote.  It replaced 5 of my remotes, which is all except my Bose, which is RF controlled.  It even replaced my Windows Media Center Edition remote and works with my PS2 with no problems.My negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions aren't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set-up.  These negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices.  I am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again
easiest remote to program. has tremendous ability to tweek. will keep recommending to all my customers
After doing a fair amount of Internet research about MP3 players and their features I was under the impression that I would go with an iPod.  Having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years I have never been fond of the Mac and have always been a little biased towards PC's.  This added to my reticence to own a Mac product and the growing complaints about service on the iPod being a 'bit' over priced I forged on.I started reading through all of the reviews I could find on the Internet and as always, found a wealth of them here on Amazon.  To my dismay all the reviews I could find on product names I knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely.  Thats is, until I got to the iAudio line.  The reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things I could easily overlook.  I love the control, I am big guy with big hands and I have rarely, if ever, pushed the control and not had the result I was intending.I have had my iAudio X5 for over a month and I have nothing bad to say in the least.  I am an avid Linux user and it works flawlessly with Linux, the sound quality is phenomenal, except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those.  The FM tuner is great (you wont get that on an iPod).  I travel a lot and I pipe my X5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port.What else can I say, this is a great product with great features and it looks good too!  I also bought a case from zCover which fits the purpose but I think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market.A Satisfied Custome
I bought this keyboard originally for the LCD screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games I play.  I was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an LCD hanging off of it.  It's the best-feeling keyboard I've ever owned.  The keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate, and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature.  The backlighting is bright, day or night, and the programmable G-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past.  Highly recommended
This is a great piece of hardware, the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me. But in my apartment I would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker, it's volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself. The bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default. The other thing is that I would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer. That's not going to happen with this system, you can't change that easily. And yes the 5 disk changer is slow. The maximum volume setting doesn't seem that loud to me, but then I have the decibal settings at default. All the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here, it has all the flavors. Hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way I'd like it too, but I only tried RCA and not the digital. I have a sony 32" Wega and I had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the DAV-FX100 reciever. That works like a charm, even with 5.1 sound from XBOX. One huge complaint I have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best. I see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers, even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my TV. There is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual! Beware! Four Stars
I used Lexar Media Multi Card REader in my P2120 Fujitsu laptop via a USB 2 PC-Card adapter.  It's truly plug-and-play without any need of drivers in Windows XP
I like to purchase service or replacement contracts on all my electronics needs, just set back and relax....YOUR COVERED. 
If you are looking for an inexpensive iPod, then I would recommend this. 
You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.Overall good value for price
First, I would buy it again if I needed to.  This 15" takes up less space on the kitchen counter, i.e., speakers are on the bottom. Second, picture and sound are excellent, i.e, clear.I would not buy this item if I wanted a true VESA mount to monitor configuration.  The stand, not the monitor, has the screw holes for the VESA wall mount.  Not enough or clear info in the description. However, it is just as easy to turn on the counter as on the wall.  If you need counter space then buy something else.
I bought the intuos 6x11 pen tablet couple weeks ago and I use italmost every day so far so good, I don't expect to have any problems with it.I used to have a small wacom graphire and I used for years then unfortunately the pen broke so now I own a new one the only advice I can give to you is to keep it clean, wipe it out every now and then with a wet cloth jo
I love my 2 GB SD memory card. I use it all the time and have had no problems with it
Alot Better Then Wrapping The Neck Strap Around Your Arm Or Hand...It Really Depends On What Kind Of Photography You Do. I Shoot At Night Clubs And Weight Can Add Up. I Have A Canon Rebel XT, Hand Grip With 2 Batties, Canon 550EX Flash, And 50mm F/1.4 Or 17-40mm F/2.8It Feels Alot Better Using The Hand Strap...
I have burned over 100 of these in the past 6 months, I have only had 1 burn badly.  Haven't found a dvd player yet that they won't play in
I recently purchased this item and I am very happy with its performance and quality. I use it daily in the gym it delivers excellent sound and you dont even realize you have it on due to its light weight
These boxes are half the size of regular cases, just right--not too bulky like the regular ones
I recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office.  the reception on this unit is great.  Bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations. The sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in.  If you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound. 
This is an awesome tablet! It has great pressure sensitivity and the pen allows for fantastic freehand drawing in programs like illustrator, photoshop and painter. The pen is a more natural feeling tool to use in these applications than a mouse. The size of the tablet allows you to get into greater detail without having to zoom in all the time.
This device is great for carriying around with your camera, you can review and share the pictures with any PC with USB available, data can also be recorded and easily recovered.
I bought a 1GB with my new camera because I was giving my other camera and it's 256 memory card to my sister.  The smaller card would fill quickly and I'd have to develope the pictures or deleat them.  I paid about $9.00 more for my card in Sept., and thought that was a deal.  Now, you can get this card for $20.00.  That's a steal for a 1 GB.  also, I like the little case provided to keep the card safe when I take it to the store to develope the pictures.  Love it
These batteries have been awesome.  My digital camera uses 4 of them at a time and they last for 100's of photographs.  Flash recharge is very quick.  Highly recommended
I've been using these earbuds for several months now, and they're far better than the ones that come with the iPod. They're more comfortable, and there's so much more bass, although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass.My pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once, and they still sound just as good as the day I got them! (I did have to glue one of the earpieces back together, though.) I thought I'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet, but these things are industrial strength
I am a mild audophile, and I love these headphones. They have great base response, treble, and isolation. If you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop, don't get get these! You won't be able to hear a thing outside of the music
You may as well pitch the instructions because they're worthless (and the only reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating for the ADS Tech Video Xpress).  I was about ready to pitch the product as well, after losing two evenings trying to figure out how to get it to work.  Ultimately, I gave up on relying solely on the program it came with, and I instead opted to try it on my Windows Movie Maker.  Yahoo!  Perseverance paid off!  Once I switched to Movie Maker, this tool worked great!  To date, I've converted about a dozen videos of content to computer files that I was able to burn to DVDs.  I just leave my Xpress hooked up to the back of my television so I don't have to try to remember later how to hook it up again.  Doing that, I can connect my laptop to the Xpress and start the video converting process within 3-4 minutes.  My Movie Maker program takes over the entire process.  The ADS Tech Video Xpress has been especially useful for me because I teach a college telecourse and often show edited video clips to my students.  Before purchasing Xpress, I had crudely edited videos that I was reluctant to use; my videos had lots of amateur stop/start points.  Using Movie Maker with Xpress, I was able to download these videos to my laptop, then easily edit them so transitions between stop and start points became smooth and seamless.  Pretty cool.  I'm glad I took a chance on this product!Below are hook-up and program instructions I've written to myself for easy reference later.  Hopefully they'll be of more help to you than the instructions that come with this product:First, hook up the Video Xpress equipment as follows:1.  S-cable (buy one, since it doesn't come with the VideoXpress) goes from the back of your television to the VideoXpress.  2.  Use red/white/yellow cords running into the back of the VCR/DVD that is hooked up to your televion as follows:- all three plug into the "video out" column- all three plug into the VideoXpress tool at the other end.  3.  The USB plug for the VideoXpress tool plugs into the back of the computer.Next, open the Instant Video Xpress program and verify the settings are as follows:- "NTSC M" for the video standard setting- "640 x 480" and "60 FPS (VGA)" for video format- "DVD, VCR, TV" for video source- "Video composite" for video inputUnder the program advanced settings:- Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD)- CPU support: "SSE3"- Stereo system: "MTS"- Video decoder: "video standard: NTSC_M"Under properties within the program advanced settings:- Stream format:  Video format: "NTSC_M"- Frame rate: "59.940"- Color space/compression: "YUY2"- Outputs size: "640x480"Finally, CLOSE the Instant Video Xpress program.  (Windows Movie Maker can't access the video until this program is closed.  And yes, it's silly to have to open it, make those setting changes, then close it, but Video Xpress won't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps.)In case you need this information for Windows Movie Maker, the steps (in order) are as follows:Under "File," click on "capture video."Use the following settings:- audio device set at: "USB2.0 Analog Audio Device"- Video input source set at: "Composite"Under Configure Video Capture Device:- Video format: Video standard: "NTSC_M"		   Frame rate: "29.970"		   Color space/compression: "YUY2"		   Output size: "640x480"Under Camera settings:- Deinterlace method: "Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD)"- CPU support: "SSE3"- Stereosystem: "MTS"Under Video decoder: Video standard: "MTSC_M"Signal detected: "1"Lines detected: "525"Then...Give the file a name and indicate where to save itSet it for "best quality" for playback.Then "Start Capture."If the Video Xpress is hooked up and running correctly, you should see on your computer monitor the video image of whatever is showing on television, but you will NOT hear the sound.  When you finish capturing and play it back, THEN you'll hear the sound.I know, I know -- clear as mud.  But hey, it's better than the Xpress instructions!  :-
Its really works fine for my items as well as my son's toys. We both  are happy with this
I have been using Memorex dvd-r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player/recorder.  Not all of my recordings were successful, no product I know is 100% perfect, but the majority have been successful with Memorex dvd blank media.This 50-pack spindle was purchased from Amazon because I know I can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping.   Moreover, I have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from Amazon.   After trying many dvd-r blank media, I found Memorex dvd-r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance. 
Not quite as powerful as I was hoping for, but the sound is alright and in a small room it'll do fine.Careful, there is no plug-in at the back, so you can only connect MP3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack.Otherwise it's easy to use and pretty cool-looking... ideal for quiet listening, lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff
The pro and cons described by other reviews are valid. I was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette, mp3, cd and radio capability. So didn't have much of an option but to get this one. I am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality. Overall I think its a good buy.
I LOVE this arm band. I have had it for about 6 months now. You dont have to take your iPOD out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer. I also only use my iPOD for the gym, so its nice that this arm band provides great protection (better than iPOD's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on) as well as not coming off while working out.
I bought the 128MB card 8-9 mnths ago. At first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller! Finally it gave a 'Error Reading Card'  message and stopped working. Customer service at Viking was very very helpful and prompt. They replaced the card is 7 days. They also tried to retrieve some of the images that I had considered 'lost' in the card and sent me a CD with the images on it! I was impressed with the excellent support, but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life. Would I buy it again? Yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well
I'm very happy with this desktop system.  Great sound, great reception, great price
I am very pleased with this item. It is fits comfortably, holds my CD player snugly and has room for my ID, keys, extra batteries  CD's
(Note to Brian: The WAP54G *can* be configured as a bridge. I have two of them in just such a configuration. Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.)Major modes of operation are:1. Wireless Access Point (its default set-up)2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device)3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage)4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a "virtual" cable; you need two to get the job done)A pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian's comment that this wouldn't work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work.I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons.1. I understand that higher-end, more expensive, equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment!2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is "admin". Well, it's not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes.3. Something that 99% of the world won't care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it's attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this
This card is the 2 GB Ultimate 120X  It has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second.  Frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed, which is always much faster. Analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second.That impacts time between pictures. For cameras, write speed is the most important, but the speed rating of the card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed.  For music players and other devices, read speed may be more important.  So you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures.  I'm currently shopping for SD cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes.  In order not to slow the camera down, I need a fast card.  I have done some research and realized that the reviews here aren't necessarily even related to this particular card, but are for all different sizes and speeds of Kingston cards. Kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings.  This card is #1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed
I bought this memory card for my camera sd500.  At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop.  After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb.  I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update.  Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first
 Same as everybody else, I ordered mine a couple of days back and it hasn't shipped...I want it!!!!!
Cool! I can expand my-single-USB-port-laptop more flexible.From single peripheral to be quadruplet. I can plug Flashdisk, mouse, external and digital camera in same time. Worth money for usefull gadget
I first saw these speakers at the Apple store, and i really liked the sound and the look.  I went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them.  As long as you have a decent soundcard, these speakers really are great.  i have had no problem with them at all, they look really cool, they're loud, they're small, the woofer gives you a lot of bass (which you can turn down), and the sound from the speakers is clear.  buy these
What else do you need to know? You plug in your PCs and a cable to your router - and go. I used a Netgear hub for years. Replaced it with this Linksys switch and my network speed improved immediately
It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin. 
You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.Overall good value for price
The mouse is perfect for games. I use it to play ET and is great. The software provided by Logitech is configurable in all ways
I wanted a non-iPod digital music player, and found this to be a terrific option.  It plays a number of different formats, and includes a lanyard, which is nice when commuting on the train, or for plane travel.  I have only used alkaline batteries so far, and have had excellent battery life.  The menu takes an hour or 2 of playing with to learn, but once you get familiar with the buttons and menu, it's pretty easy.  I have also enjoyed the built in FM tuner, and have not any trouble with reception, even on a moving commuter train.  The sound quality is very good.  I've been using 128 bitrate MP3 songs so far.  The software for transferring music is pretty easy to use, although I did have a little trouble getting the player to be recognized as connected, which seemed to be some kind of order of connections issue.  The included earbuds aren't the most comfortable, especially since I already lost the foam padding, but I will probably get a better pair anyway.  They do sound good though.  Also, the included cases are pretty cheesy and I didn't even bother with them.A little hint:  One thing I did not like was that because of the location of the on button, the unit can fairly easily be turned on when you have it stored in a bag or pocket.  To combat this, simply turn the Hold on.  The unit won't turn on accidentally when it's on
I've had this device for two years.  Just today I sent it through the wash cycle of my laundry (not on purpose).  The thing still works!! I will not, however, try sending it into the dryer though beause I'm pretty sure that would fry this thing
I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice
I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended
Just a note to those who've been having trouble opening these cases, without breaking them. If you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together, you'll be able to open and close it ok. Don't sand too much, and just do the top knob, or it won't hold together. I like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive, so I wanted to make them work. Hope it works for you
The CF card works fine but it's response is kind of slow compaired to the 32MB CF card came with my Canon Powershot A95. I got this card 3 weeks ago and so far their hasn't been any problems.
I do all my burning on a standard Windows Media player, and it's almost entirely data and music, no video. For my purposes, these CD's sound great. In some cases, it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat. That may be a trick my ears are playing on me but, nevertheless, I'm a big fan of the Memorex. And they're a steal if you catch the sale price. Recommended
When I buy flash memory, I consider price, speed, manufacturer and vendor. I got this particular memory stick for a SonyEricsson w810i phone. I paid extra to get it from Amazon (no they don't always have the best price). This way I am confident that I can return it if I got the wrong one or have a problem with it.The card works fine in my phone, and since I have a USB cable that hooks up to the phone, I don't have to be concerned about removing the card to use a card reader. I have not yet experienced any problems with Sandisk memory products.I am told that the Sandisk sticks are faster than Sony's, but I have no way to confirm this, nor do I know if my phone (mp3 player, camera) is able to take advantage of faster speeds. The longest process is transferring music to the phone, and I wasn't in a hurry anyway.This stick comes with an adapter to use with the older memory stick format, so I can use the 128mb stick that I replaced in my Sony Camcorder (which had a 4mb stick in it. No, it's not a typo. It's actually a 4 megabyte memory stick)
These earphones are incredible! They are comprised of excellent bass and treble. You experience everything much nicely. These earphones compared to the iPod headphones are excellent unlike those raggety things. I bought these from ebay for $8 and for that amount of price, you can't regret buying these sensational earphones
Just my two cents, I bought these from the sony store for $15 bucks two years ago, they've lasted me this long for light office use, so at $7/year, this seems to be a good budget earphones.  I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need expensive earphones.  However they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack, the wires got loose and the sound just stopped.  Moral of the story: don't twist or touch the wires/cable.Pros:  lightweight, budget-oriented, comfortable fit for my earsCons:  eventually broke, cheap earphone covers will get lost easil
Muy pero muy bueno, es mejor todavia que el primer dvd que salio de esta gira

If you snap shots in burst mode, or if you want to take pictures at sporting events, fast cards like those are the way to go.Almost no lag, large capacity, lifetime warranty, no complaints
I purchased several of these cards .... they work great and as advertised. The D200 has a memory buffer ... but these are still FAST cards!  I have used them in the D70 as well. 
Sandisk, leader in this kind of technology products sure do not come short with this one. It works excellent on my phone Samsung t609.I would have bought a 1GB but the phone manufacturer do not recomend it, so bear that in mind. For pictures the resolution at close range and bright light is just excellent. For music as an MP3, lots of memory and room to fill as well as for video. Data and in general is terrific...just like I said Sandisk leads the competition and also seems to be the the standard card for just about any product that requires this kind of card. I will most definitely and undoubtely will not accept substitutions. Only Sandisk is extremely reliable. Personal experiences with these products proof it repeatledly. 
I use the memory card in my Samsung d807 phone.  Works perfecty
For the Price, I doubt you could do better.  True, there are higer-end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance, but if all you're after is a significant improvement in the quality of EVERY channel and DVD you watch, you can't beat the ADS for it's price. The biggest flaw is the device's inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds, where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my Philips Plasma set to black-out for moments.  This aside, I'm very happy with the ADS, especially it's under $300 price.  One day maybe I'll upgrade to a unit by DVDO, but not until they come don to the sub-$500 range
The one in our bedroom wouldn't always work, couldn't hear the kids calling.  I was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice.  Both my Dell charger and Thinkpad charger had the same effect, even without the laptop plugged into the charger.  If your having problems, I would start with unplugging other things first.Overall, these have been a Godsend, wife no longer has to scream at the kids across the entire house.  Used to drive me crazy
This is a nice product,i buught it beacause i needed to play DVDs from foreign country and my fancy "sony" dvd vcr player can't read them but this little thing can,it reads all the standards i'm glad i've got it. 
I was burned by another company with I bought their product and they didn't offer a replacement plan.  The item died and no one can repair it
Great price for a 128MB jump drive, works perfectt for my daughters college work, such a good price I bought 
I used to buy Energizers and Duracells at $3-4 a pop for four batteries.  Now I buy generic Alkalines at Costco.  Cost: $8 for 10 four packs.  It's like having a battery store in the kitchen drawer.  According to a recent coprehensive story in Consumer Reports, there is only a little difference between name brand and generic alkaline batteries
You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.Overall good value for price
I bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new Sony MHCEC70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner.  Having once owned an earlier PM-series model, this new Panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint.  Like its predecessor, the PM53 is a nice, powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner, especially on the FM band.  It can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses.  The remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual.  Right now, this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning.  Sony's competing models are cheesy-looking (hog attention on store shelves,) bigger (i.e., take more materials/cost more to ship,) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified (and of course, proprietary) antenna connector.  It's like choosing between the Pontiac and the Toyota.  The Sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling.  The Panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture. 
Bag is attractive and very sturdy.  The computer fits securely and is well padded.  I recently used it on a trip and was able to place other carry on items in it and it traveled well
Drive got to me timly, installed per instructions, and works wel
picture sound all great. the only problem is that you must have an advanced degree in english,engineering,and computer science to set the television up.  without my cable company making a house call setup is impossibl
This mount is nicely designed and well-made; it fit the TV perfectly. Our only criticism is that the screws provided for attaching it to the wall were of poor quality. The heads stripped out right away and it took a trip to the hardware store to get replacements
I read some of the reviews about installation issues and they concerned me initially. But, when it came time to get the printer up and running on my wireless network, there really weren't any issues. Just following the directions (and avoiding the EasySecure option) worked fine. I would highly recommend this printer-the quality of the printing is excellent, the feature/function set is quite high for a moderate price, and it's a great home/office printer that has lots to offer.
Maybe beginning ones were a bad batch? Had mine months now and it works great. Everything it says, it does. No problems  keeping it in the system and did not cause any errors.
The CS70 is an excellent product, easy to setup and use and good battery life
Great memory card for the price.  I would highly recommen
This xD memory card works perfectly with my camera Fujifilm Finepix F650. Good buy for the price
I bought this because I did not want to mount my Garmin 350 Nuvi to the windshield. This device makes is much easier to switch the unit to different cars. I drove normally and the unit did not slide around on my dashboard. I can also mount the unit on a center console and it works there too. Please note that this is a complete unit for portable mounting and it is much cheaper than buying the sandbag  mounting arm separately
I have had my Handspring Visor Deluxe for 5...yes, FIVE years (actually longer).  While I take decent care of it, it has taken care of me.  My doctor has one too...exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced, but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to.  I finally ordered a new PDA with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it. (I'm not selling it...good karma)  Down to business - the Handspring Visor Deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore.  But in its day it was.  Great product and if you don't need the bells and whistles (or color display)...go for this.  Totally flawless.  People often complain about the styli of other PDAs.  No complaints here.  Not only is it relatively comfortable, it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends (doesn't break) and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device.  I literally lost my ORIGINAL stylus just a few days ago.  The display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now, but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun (heck, a good deal of the new ones don't have IR)... go for it.  And for the price I just saw it listed for on Amazon ($85) it's a total steal.  Great product
The item works perfectly if you do not place it near other mechanical devices, i.e. TV, air purifier, elec. clock, etc.  Fortunately it hasn't alerted us yet so that will remain to be experienced.  You have to turn it anumber of directions until you get the best reception, then leave it in that  position
This is the best value you can get. Awesome picture with 10,000:1 Contrast Ratio. My XBOX 360 looks amazing with 1080i resolution. Definitely worth the money. You would not be disappointed with this TV.
I got this on sale for $80 and i love it. It holds about 300 songs, gets plenty loud, has amazingly good battery life, and takes all my abuse. I play it at least 2 hours a night, if not all night, its my alarm in the morning, i listen to it in the car, on the bus, before school, during lunch, ok how bout his i use it a ton. I never leave home without it its small, easy and comfortable to hold, and it wont die if you drop it. Wiht my previous player I had an issue with it erasing all the songs and i know other people who have had that issue with other players but this one hasn't let me down yet. O  one big plus the battery back is attached so it will never dissapear
I bought this to record interviews done primarily on the phone and it's worked beautifully. Clear and easy to use. Once downloaded onto my computer I used the Olympus transcription package to transcribe the interviews. This allowed me to listen on headphones, control the progression (and backtracking)of the interview with a foot pedal and keep both hands on the keyboard to type quickly. This voice recorder plus the transcription package dramatically cut the amount of time I had to take trascribing the interviews. Well worth the price. I'd recommend this combo highly, especially to other journalists.
I've been very pleased with this external drive-500GB. My only comments would be that at first the drive was a little 'hit or miss' with mounting on the desktop but a restart would always fix it. Now it seems to always mount. Its all automatic so no need to ever touch the drive. The other thing would be that it could use one more FireWire 400 port (there is only one). I don't use 800 yet so I need to daisy it off of my SmartDisk FireLite that happens to have 2. All in All-Get this drive
Solid product.  Headphone/speaker jack on my laptop died and manufacturer wanted $40 just to cover shipping fees to have it fixed!  I bought this great little unit instead for under $30.  Good audio.  Actually, it saved my laptop once too, laptop fell from 2-3 feet but landed right on the rubberized Turtle Beach Micro, which took most of the force.  It was bent 90 degrees at the USB connector but it still worked!  Proof of solid construction..
This is our first LCD TV.  Our tube TV finally died.  My wife actually picked out this unit and Consumer Reports also recommended this unit.  We purchased it directly from AMAZON on January 23, 2007.  I wanted to wait a couple of months before I write my review to see if anything happens. But to my surprise the TV is still running and there have been no problems.  We have digital HD and the pictures are great.  It took me a couple of weeks to get use to watching tv with such sharp color and contrast.  However, if you are watching normal digital programming you may not be too happy as it is flat.  But overall its a good buy for us
I researched TVs for a long time before I ended up buying this set.  It helped that Costco offered a coupon for $300 off the price ($1000 final price).   I thought I may not like the TV, so I decided to buy in person as opposed to online to help with a potential return.  However, there is no way I am returning this TV; it's awesome.  The picture is great, and that is just with SD.  The Strech feature makes the regular 4:3 picture fit the screen and not look distored.  I was worried about buying the 37" TV and then having to watch with the black bars on the sides to avoid distortion.  But there is no need with this TV since Sharp has figured out how to strech the picture without distortion.  DVDs look incredible on this TV as well.   What is even better is the built-in HD tuner.  I was debating upgrading my cable to the HD package, but I decide to spend $13 on "rabbit ears" from Target.  Oh my, once I plugged in the indoor antenna and let the TV track for digital stations I was amazed.  The analog station popped up like a fierce snowstorm in winter, but when I went up to the HD digital companion station, I couldn't believe my eyes.  An incredible HD picture with the rabbit ears set on my desk...indoors no less!   Why would I upgrade my cable TV to the HD package when they can't offer the local stations in HD?  Especially when they are FREE with a simple antenna!  I was told this was possible, but quite frankly I was skeptical.  Not anymore, I am so glad I got the Sharp that has the built-in tuner.  I seriously considered just buying the HD ready TV monitor and upgrade through my cable provider.  Boy am I glad that I didn't do that.  If you are in the market for a very nice TV that is easy to use and provides a great picture, I would highly recommend this set. 
This is a great product. It was easy to mount and looks great. The only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall, but from what I have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches. I have a 32" LCD mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so I always try to keep it closer to the wall, but every time I come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees. This hasn't caused any problems and I'm sure this is well within its design strength. Highly Reccommended
This is a high quality, precision made piece. I'm very particular about the construction of things that I buy and this Peerless arm more than met my expectations. It was easy to attach to the back of my 32" LCD television and equally easy to mount to the wall. I read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble. Not so here. Everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen. All hardware is included along with clear, complete instructions. I'd be surprised if you could find something better
Pros:Like a quality piano, the keys give a sense of weight, the bend in the keyboard tool some getting used too but now am typing a full speed.  The mouse offers great control, though I haven't much used all the buttons that are one the form.Cons:The only gotcha is if the computer freezes, there is no way to control-alt-delete.  Also, Setting the favorite keys to non microsoft items tends to reset after updates and restarts
One warning for users with over head lights.  The 6000 keyboard that has tranparent (light gray) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right.  I have a light directly above my desk  and the reflected glare off the keys makes all the letters and numbers disappear.  Go for a black key or similar model
After going through nearly 6 mouses (including several of the Microsoft mouses), I settled on this because its round contuour shape and large effective button area that extend very far back. It also works with my KVM switch, which is a key consideration. The buttons are a bit stiff but I expect them to "loosen" up a bit after some use. I highly recommend this mouse
They are everything the other reviewers said they were, and I, too, can't wait until the printing is darker and in color!  Wish it didn't take so long to print and hope the darker images and color only require an upgrade
I used two 12 foot cables with a coupler for a 24 foot PCM connection between my satellite receiver and my home theater system.  The Dolby 5.1 is excellent
this is one of the best in its class for the low price. quick, and responsive, and very convenient for a frequent web browser. the back and forward buttons on it work like a charm and are perfect for the web
Replaced my old 22" Cinema Display that was 5 years old. What a difference. Clear screen, flawless finish, solid and adjustable stand. Easy hook-up, it took longer to clean the dust off my computer than hook this up!
I got this monitor along with a keyboard. When I get home I plug my laptop into both and I have a huge screen to do my work on. The colors are terrific, the mouse works seamlessly across the laptop screen and the big auxilliary screen. Wish I had done this a long time ago
Just remember to use the proper cable, Cat 5e or Cat 6
Like so many other small home office users, I have recently upgraded my network to 1000mpbs to help increase productivity.  Unfortunately, I originally purchased a GigE 8 port switch from another mfg. that used a fan on their switch, a VERY noisy fan.  After a month of listening to what sounded like an airplane engine, I tossed that unit and purchased this 8port Netgear GigE unit.  It is SILENT.  Basically a plug and play item due to its unmanaged nature, I have had good data thru put and no problem.  It comes with a small clip on stand for vertical storage if desired.  The unit is finished in an attractive gray and chrome exterior.  It is also small enough to live on a desktop with sucking up valuable real estate.So, if you are looking for a switch that will not be stored remotely in some closet, this is the one that will keep the peace in your office. A+ ****
I have this radio for two weeks now.  I am very satisfied with the reception of AM, FM and Short Wave -- very sensitive.  Has great sound.  The only negative is the lack of being able to preset the stations.  Would buy the radio again - worth the money
How can  you go wrong with a price so low. They're good for both parents and kids to use. Not to mention they're easy for young kids to operate! Keep in touch
     This card, using VIA's superb Envy24 HT chipset, is a huge improvement over my Realtek and VIA Envy24HT-S based cards.  Everything sounds better.       My old Audigy 2 platinum (which I think I shall melt) did better in 3D games, but only slightly. Since this card doesn't snap, crackle, and pop like the Creative cards do, I'll venture to say that it actually DOES make games better, since there are no weird noises distracting from the feel of the game.     PROS:* Very high audio sampling rates, allowing for incredibly good audio production; warm, rich, warm bass all the way up to crystal clear highs.* No crackling, popping, or hissing!  A real joy after pulling my hair out for years trying to figure out why Creative Labs cards keep doing this.* Well-maintained, solid drivers.* Supports EAX 2.0* Excellent ASIO support.     CONS:* No hardware support for DirectSound; however, if your machine is faster than about 1GHz, you probably won't notice the difference.  Benchmark your results on a machine made in the last three years and you'll find that no hardware DirectSound acceleration amounts to *less* than a 1% difference in speed.* Only supports up to EAX 2.0, due to Creative Labs refusing to license the technology.  Sound difference is minimal, though
I'm using this Monster cable to connect my iPod to my receiver via an iPod dock and it works flawlessly.  Sound is crisp and clear.  Plus, it's a lot cheaper than getting the actual Monster iPod AV cable.  The length of the cable makes it convenient but not too cumbersome.  It's a great way to increase the functionality of your iPod
Within about 12 seconds of opening the box I was listening to my IPOD on my home stereo.  Wires are well made.There may be cheaper options that work as well but these will last forever
I ordered a pair of these online, a bit nervous as I wasn't ever able to hear them (I heard a pair of JBL SP6C's, the cheaper version, at Best Buy, and wasn't all that impressed, although it might have been the poor listening environment).  Anyway, the speakers arrived, we installed them (they look great and inconspicuous in our living room ceiling) and I'm quite impressed.  Note that we're using these for "whole-house" background music, not home theater, so my standards aren't as high as they would be in the HT case.  But for a 6.5" speaker, these put out a surprising amount of bass, and clear highs.  Right now we just have a cheap amplifier hooked up while we're shopping for a better one, and they still sound great.  These probably would be just fine for HT rear-speaker use (I wouldn't want any in-ceiling speaker for front or center HT use).Our home theater downstairs already has JBL speakers (studio series for the fronts and center, northridge for the rears) and I've been very happy with them.  I recommend these for those who need a great looking and decent sounding in-ceiling speaker without breaking the bank. 
Bought 2 of these to watch over my house while I am at work.  Setup is pretty easy, but be prepared to wait a minute after changed settings, many changes when you initial setup the camera require it to restart.  Camera's work great together and the free use of [...] to access the cameras is nice.  Setting up timers and sensor emails/ftp is pretty straight forward but will require a user to test and retest to get the settings just right.Pros: Price is good for a ip camera with tilt/pan.  viewnetcam.com feature is a great addition to the camera package.  Works great with similar model panasonic cameras.Cons: Multiple restarts while setting up or making changes(minor issue), limited online support/how-to's
After reading all the connection problems with wireless IP cameras , I decided to purchase the wired ver. (BL-C10A panasonic). I was very pleased with the easy setup and dns service included for the camera . I currently use this camera in a cabin , so I can look in and see the temp. inside and look around. This is simpe remote monitoring , as hookup took less than 1.hr to get up and running. I do not use the emailing feature presently .Pros : simple to setup and get running over internet       price is reasonable       images are the best for a camera this cheap       using viewnet  (dns service) very easy  Cons : wired to the router        no included light leds (but at this price)       must use timer to reset ip camera (cheap house timer every 24hrs
The product works well for my space and needs. One note to Amaazon. When you ship a $400 item, thats semi fragile, and the box shows up looking like it was used as a make shift soccer ball, how does the consumer deal with physical damage? The item is so massive to ship back, and most likey costly.I experimented with buying an expensive electronic online because the price was right. I was worried how the shipping would be handled, and sure enough, I was worried rightfully. The DVD tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out. The top of the receiver/dvd player had been slightly caved in. Even with all the packing Samsung supplied, it could not protect the product from the shipping company. It will be such a hassle to try and exchange this, that I am not sure if I will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again. Other than that, I have purchased smaller items, and less fragile from Amazon with no issues. I realize that the shipping damage canot be held on Amazon, as it is out of their control. I just don't think I will roll the dice on something like this in the future. Too bad, it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen
Not quite as bright a conventional flashlight, but certainly bright enough. No battery feature can't be beat. Manufacturer claims it will stay on for a hour with a one minute wind. I've never left mine on that long, but I've only needed to wind it once in over a year. This is an excellent flashlight. I've bought several
I was unsure of whether to purchase this product when I saw that my printer (HP Deskjet 712C) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others' reviews, I tried it anyway because the price was right.  It may look a little cheesy but it works.  I didn't even need the CD that comes with it in order to use the product.  I just plugged it in to my printer and then into my new Dell laptop and it worked.  I think I may have had to restart and add my printer but that was it.  Very good product
Do you have an OLD printer you would like to tie to that NEW lap top?  I did and at first I didn't think it could be done but a little quick research on Amazon and I found this beauty.  The Sabrent cable is very well made and has the look of quality and ruggedness.  I just plugged it in and everything took off without a hitch.  (PC w/Windows XP
Great picture, great price, superb  fast delivery by Amazon (via EGL trucking).No complaints except for a faint buzzing sound on the plasma TV. I have heard that all plasma's "buzz" a bit. This would not stop me from purchasing this TV again
I was looking for a tv that offered bang for buck.  So I knew Samsung is the way to go.  Except my wife was not eager as I was, but soon after buying it The Planet Earth HD Discovery channel show was on.  Now I can not get my wife to stop talking about HD.  We love the TV not the best tv, but best for the price.  Nice design and easy to use
I have had my Samsung for about three weeks now; no problems.  I am extremely hapy with the picture quality and the number of inputs.  We also bought the 42" plasma for my parents; we've been extremely happy with it as well.  In addition to the television, I am extrmemly happy with Amazon and the delivery process.  Everythin was handled very professionally.  The tv arrived within the timeframe and undamaged.  I will buy next tv through Amazon as well
These speakers deliver a clear, crisp, and vibrant sound, with a richness expected of a higher-end speaker.  I would recommend these to anyone interested in a good-quality sound but keeping an eye on price
After reading several reviews on this unit, we purchased it.  The majority of our equipment supported gigabit and so we decided it was time to "get in the game".  It took less then 15 minutes to install in our rack and change over to it.  All I can say is "wow"!  The performance is phenomenal.  We have had no issue with it since switching over and it just plain works.  I cannot believe that we can obtain that level of speed in network applications for the price we paid.  Highly recommended
I bought this product mainly for my girlfriend to use on my computer. I find myself using it most of the time, now!  The mouse is great, lost of extra buttons on it (not that I need them, but it makes it a little more convenient in case I do.)  The Keyboard is great...lots of shortcut buttons right on the keyboard, making navigation VERY easy.  A couple of features on the keyboard I really like are the scroll whell on the left, the favorites buttons (all customizable, as are all the shortcut buttons on this keyboard) and the very comfortable hand rest.  I got this refurbished and it works like new!  I HIGHLY suggest this.  The only drawback is that it is a little bigger than I would have liked, but I don't mind it nearly as much as my girlfriend.  If that's not a problem, I highly suggest this product!!
Not much to say here.  It works.  Easily adjustable with just your feet.  Feels good wearing socks
This is a surprisingly good radio at this price. It is small, compact and yet very robust and quite heavy. It is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store. Here are three things I really liked about this product: 1) The AM/FM reception is outstanding. I am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear. Listening to FM on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure. 2) The buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function. This is something Sangean seems to get very well. 3) The multi-level display lighting can be turned OFF, or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright. A few things I didn't like. The pilot light for "ON" is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night. I had to put black electrical tape over it. The AUX input is a mini-jack instead of RCA connector. Minor inconvenience here. And finally, the cabinet is nice wood, but the finish is not as good as I think it could be. This radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than I expected for this price. It's a keeper
I want the DVDs I'm making to last to as close to forever as possible, so I did a lot of research before deciding what DVDs to buy.  Verbatim came out as #1 for durability.  I chose the DVD-R format for maximum compatibility with various devices.  And I've only had a few errors after burning about 75 DVDs.Amazon's sale price for these was great.  If you're just looking for short-term backup media, I'm sure you can find cheaper, but these are a different class of DVDs
With my new LCD television, the hook-up was a snap and what a difference with the new HDMI compatible up-scale DVD I installed.  The audio and visual difference for DVD and HD television programing is amazing with the cost at half the price at retail stores.  Very happy and highly recommended
This works perfectly, and it is built very well.  My picture looks great and sound is also great
Wonderful for those who type and work with computers alot--soft and comfortable!  I haven't had any problems with carpal tunnel since!  It didn't have a nasty smell as other reviewers stated.  A great buy; saves me a lot of pain
This phone is clear and easy to use ...have had a couple and have not been disapointe
This performs better than the unit offered at the Apple store at about 20% of the cost! Plus it has an indicator light and the folding plug is handy for travel. Good deal
I had an old Palm m100 for the longest time and used it as an electronic replacement for a paper organizer. But it ate batteries and wasn't rechargeable, so when I got a newer computer without a serial port (and discovered it would cost a fairly decent sum for a serial-USB connector), I decided to upgrade. Thought it'd be cool to have something with mp3 playing capabilities as well, (I don't own an iPod or other small mp3 player) but I didn't need many features beyond an organizer (didn't need for e-mail, etc) and didn't want to spend much over $75. Pros: I like the Palm interface, very intuitive.Calendar  contacts work wellPlays mp3'sSyncs well with Outlook/computerPlugs in to recharge; all cords came with it.Easy to download new software (I recommend Blocks, it's similar to Tetris)Cons or caveats:Display: when viewing calendar in "full month" mode, I have trouble seeing any entries unless I view the screen at an angle. Not a deal-breaker, but a little odd. They probably improved this with newer (pricier) models, but you get what you pay for. I can read all other screens just fine.Haven't used it to display photos; I don't think I'd use this to do that--resolution isn't worth the effort.Expansion card: WARNING: WILL NOT READ ANY CARD OVER 1GB size! (I had purchased a 2GB card with the intent of putting mp3's on it and listening to them on the Zire. Wouldn't read it. Didn't realize this till I read the fine print. Fortunately, I have a camera which takes SD cards so I can use in the camera).Listening to mp3's: This really isn't gonna replace an iPod for features. They do say that listening to mp3's uses more battery than other functions. I would agree but then I've not used this for long periods of time as an mp3 player, so I can't really say. Functionally, mp3's play just fine with RealOne player. Sound quality is pretty good BUT I have noticed a "hiss" background noise when using earbud-style headphones; it's a lot less noticeable with "outside-the-ear" style headphones. Recommendation: outside-the-ear style headphones with an in-line (cord) volume control. If you're in a quiet environment, the lowest volume level on the RealOne player isn't all that soft. With non-volume-adjustment headphones, the lowest volume level (there's a slider bar on screen) was the loudest I wanted to hear. Headphones with a volume adjustment fixes that problem.Overall, it's been worth the $$ for me as a replacement for my former m100, and it works ok as an mp3 player, as long as you can recharge it on a regular basis
This arm-band is surprisingly good.  I initially got it for my boyfriend for his iRiver, but I was afraid it wouldn't fit his arms since he's very muscular.  Surprisingly - it stretched enough and wasn't tight!  He loves it.  I thought there might be too much motion on mine when I run or use the eliptical, but no, it's fine
This product is exactly as described and arrived very quickly... A+++++ seller!  Will definately buy from again
This receiver puts out a lot of power. It also has a bit of weight to it. It comes with a microphone to automatically adjust it for optimal surround sound. The remote take some getting used to but it is great how you can hook up a DVD player, CD player, radio and many other devices. The display is nice. You really have to read the manual before you start plugging away. If you're a surround sound fan on a budget pick this up
A couple years ago I got a projector for the "big screen effect", and decided to finally get my mini Advents out of storage for the surround sound. My OLD Pioneer receiver worked ok, but I decided it was time to upgrade. I have 30 year old Speaker Lab (build 'em yourself) speakers up front with the Advents in back.The only complaint I have with this unit is there is no way to connect a turn table (yes, I'm old). So I kept the Pioneer for dedicated service to the record player.I have my son hook everything up as he is taking networking in school. For him it's a breeze. I don't even look at the directions. I just say "here".Having said that; I think this thing is great! If you are my age and can go back 30 years to your first sound system, you paid a lot more to get a simple 200 watt system (WOW) for your records and cassettes. Ahh.... technology.I love this thing! I can understand that some folks want something better, but for 95% of us, this will be the last one you will ever need.Highly recommended.4 stars for the lack of LP connection. Otherwise.... 5 all the way
I just got mine from Amazon (after a lengthly delay).  It is an awesome memory card.  It comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras.  I tested it on the camera and it worked great.  The real test was the compatibility with the SONY PSP.  No issues there.   The card worked flawlessly.  I've already used up 600 MB.....its a must buy!Plus, at $99.99, its much less than other retailers.   btw, i ordered it at $104.99, then contacted amazon about the price drop.  They credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one-day shipping at no charge because of the delay.  Overall great service too.
I use this 1GB card in my Sony Playstation Portable, and it is awesome!  The tranfer rate using the USB 2.0 cable to the PSP is very good, and I love having all that storage space for movies, music, and images.  I got the Ultra II because I had read that Sandisk outperformed Sony in speed tests, and I have to agree.  The tranfer rate seems much faster than with the 32MB Sony card that came with the PSP.  For an extra $5-$10 I got the Ultra II that has a warranty and better performance.  I think it is well worth it
When compared to other 1st generation iPod Shuffle armbands, this one is just as good, if not better, and you can't beat the price.  Definitely worth every penny
The BCI-3eBk is good quality black ink for an inkjet printer.  I have used this ink for a couple of years now and don't recall it smudging on the pages I print.  The price on this product (compared to HP products) is fair, but I am able to print a 100 to 200 pages before running out of ink.  Of course, you will get more pages out of this cartridge if you print more color graphics than text
good price.  Just not sure it is needed
The first one I ordered worked for about four days and then stopped recognizing the USB devices I was plugging into it.  Although I had considered just getting a refund, Amazon was quick to replace the card with no hassles.  The replacement card has been working fine for a couple of months now.  The USB 2 is much faster than the original USB ports that were a part of my original computer and this particular card was a reasonable price
I own the HP 475 and since it's slightly larger then the rest, the printer barely fits in the case. It does fit but it is very tight. I would not recommend this for the 475. Probably I shouldn't have bought this but I really liked the case
This cable has worked fine for me with no problems.  I'm using it to connect an inexpensive keyboard to a laptop
Outstanding item. Plenty of room to carry dvds. Enough padding to protect the player, but not too bulky
I wish Targus made the same bag just a few inches wider.  My Toshiba 2600 barely squeezes in the bag.  However, it does fit and I was able to mount it between the two seats of our 2004 Toyota Sienna with no problems.  There's also ample room for cords and DVDs. I like how this bag doubles as a storage case and a way to mount it in the car for viewing.  All in all, a very nice product. 
There are some things I like about this, others I don't. Some people have written similar reviews, but I want to add my 2 cents. Hope this helps potential buyers.Likes:1. Small, easy to use2. Good sound quality3. Good storage capacity for those of us who don't have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers.4. Some people have complained that the Creative Media software is hard to understand. I disagree, I found it straightforward. You can even change the titles, artists, and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player. Yes, I realize this can also be done in WMP, but sometimes you want to edit later, or you missed something earlier.5. Replaceable battery. If it dies, you can get another one, you don't have to send it in to the company.Dislikes:1. The shuffle mode is annoying. It doesn't go through the entire playlist on shuffle. Once a song is over, it goes right back onto the potential playlist, and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played, to the exclusion of the other items on the list. I want to hear all my songs at least once before I hear repeats.2. The Creative Media Center software doesn't install on Windows Vista.3. This is a hard drive player, so no running with it. That's okay though for people like me: I don't run. It also makes it cheaper than the IPod Nano, which is a flash player.4. The cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer. I don't like this because I'm not always around my computer, I don't lug it with me everywhere I go. However, there are ports you can buy (here on Amazon, even) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports, so that's handy.5. Not as many accessories as the IPod, but not that important.6. You can't view your photos while you are listening to music. Sometimes this sucks, but if you have a camera phone, or are in an actual conversation with someone, you probably won't be listening to your music anyway.
The Creative Zen is outstanding. Took a little while to get use to the controls but the sound is incredible. I bought one for my wife as well and see loves it.  I did spend a little extra money for better earbuds. For the price that I paid -[...] for 8GB you can't go wrong
I totally love this Cd Wallet- it is not too big and not too small. The construction of this piece is very sturdy. I've owned this for a while now and it still looks new. The color is a classic, the only problem I have with it is that the CD pockets are very flimsy other than that the exterior of this piece is unbelievable. I love it!!! I actually bought another one, oh another note do be careful because the if you don't handle the zipper with care it tends to get caught. But nothing major :
The very first DVD player I bought was Sony's very first 5 Disc DVD changer back in 1998. It was an excellent player, but as the technology improved, it could no longer keep up. I upgraded to a single disc Sony which could handle DTS, and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video. But I always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start. At about one-third the price of that original DVD changer, this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player. It produces an excellent picture, has lots of tweakable settings, has more outputs, and is also very stylish looking.I do have a couple of nits, though. My original DVD changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc I wanted. With this one, I have to press a Disc Skip button to cycle through all the discs until I reach the one I want. The front of the player does have direct access buttons, though. I wish I still had my old remote control as I'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality.Second, the upscaling through HDMI produces a great image, but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p. In fact, upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture. It's also unfortunate that while connected through HDMI, progressive scan cannot be turned off. This shouldn't be an issue most of the time, but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off. Progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote, but they cannot be turned off when connected through HDMI. One last thing about the HDMI connection. There can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using HDMI connections and digital TVs. This is not a problem with the player, but with the way HDMI is currently implemented. This player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem. However, the audio-sync adjustment doesn't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs. Since I need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound, the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here. And that's a shame. By the way, there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component, s-video, or composite outputs.There's also a minor thing I've found about all my Sony DVD players that I haven't liked. They are unable to correctly display Time Remaining on certain discs, or more commonly on the special features (documentaries, etc.) on certain discs. I also have a cheapo Philips player which has no problems displaying Time Remaining on those things (even on the menu). It's an improvement I'd really like to see implemented on future players.Now, despite the complaints I've listed above, don't get me wrong. This is still an excellent player and I really love it. I happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it. It really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances, and I feel it's the best DVD player I've ever owned. It's just not quite perfect. In all likelihood, it's also the last DVD player I'll ever own as I'll probably be buying a BluRay or other HD player in a couple of years when that format war is over. But this is a great player to hold me over until then
These headphones sound pretty good, but they aren't the best.  When running, the volume controller gets in the way and bounces.  It is also easy to change the volume which is annoying.  I also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange.  I realize it is done intentionally, but it does nothing for me.  Overall, for just listening at your desk or in your room, these are great headphones.  For running, I would recommend something else
I needed a way to power my laptop, and my batteries for my camcorder, as well as my digital camera. This was done without a problem when my wife and I visited Slovakia.
I installed this antenna in my Pawn Shop where we keep most of our electronics running all day. I could never get good reception with standard antennas and now this single antenna does the job better than any I have ever seen. Keep in mind that I have a full surveillance systen, alarm syster, phone system, 20 home stereos, a dozen or more computers and on and on. The Terk FM-50 has exceeded my expectations.  Thanks, Joel DBA Pawn-Plus
Radio reception in my apartment is terrible.  I have purchased a few indoor antennas, even a different Terk model, but none of them helped very much. I had to move the antenna around to different areas for different stations, and my digital FM radio only received one digital channel.This unit, however, works great.  I get every station I want, and the digital FM works great.  The only thing I would mention is that the antenna casing is bulky, so if you're concerned about asthetics you'll have to figure out where you can conceal it.  Also, I didn't get any additional benefit from the amplifier, but the antenna worked so well that I didn't need it
After reading several reviews on portable speakers, I decided to purchase the Sonic Impact i-F2 for my iPod.  It has great sound quality, the case is durable, it packs away easily and you can take it anywhere.  You can listen to music while its charging and the sounds system is quite attractive.  This is by far the best accessory I've purchased for my iPod.  Did I mention that it has a remote control!!
Contrary to popular belief, I even had a good experience the one time I needed technical support. A few random disconnects, but overall a great product
Remember back in the day when CDs first came out? I do: hi-fi shops and all my male relatives proudly did these demonstrations of scatching a cd, putting it into a player, PLAY   *presto* the disc played.Well, either they were making bomb-proof players back thens or the laser never got to the scratched bit of the disc because I used to have piles of discs were handled carelessly and didn't play. Yes, you read correctly: I USED to have stacks of unplayable discs.If you don't read any further, you can stop at the end of this sentence: SKIP DR WORKS!Here's the short of it1. I have my own multination consulting firm2. I have worked with computer in the media and creative industries for over 20 years3. I dislike misleading reviews4. I dislike wasting my time looking for products that work5. I dislike being lied to  wasting my money and 6. I dislike people aggressively selling me stuff that they have little knowledge about  frankly doesn't work On top of that, I am impressed NEITHER by people that trash products that do work NOR people that work for certain manufacturers, create ghost profiles and trump up their employer's products.SKIP DOCTORS works. I own over 3,500 discs. Out of that number, I had countless discs -- from my beloved Trance Planet disc, a Jessye Norman classical and spirituals collection, stuff by Miles Davis, reams of and Nina Simone compilations to computer program discs, backups of various creative projects, rare SACDs (SuperAudio CDs) and stuff that got mangled at parties or  being dragged around the world before CreativeLabs and Ipod came on the scene -- that were ALL unreadable. I have seen the sprays, I have seen the wipes, I have seen the low grade sandpaper product, I have tried using BRASSO metal polish (a remedy recommended by a friend of mine from Venezuela -- and for little scratches actually works) and low-grade industrial solvent. HANDS DOWN, short of the industrial strength polishing machines (that handle 500 plus discs at a time and go from $1500 to over $5000), SKIP DR (and all its incarnations GAME DR / DVD DR / PHOTO DR) WORKS. Period.Why did I only rate the product '4 stars'?Simple: this review is about the mechanical version of the product. And I am lazy: mechanised means EFFORT. Will I buy the mechanised version?Definitely! The product is in my shopping basket will be ordered (when I finish writing this review to set the record straight!
They say it's quiet, and it holds tons of data.  They were correct.  Fast access speed, easy installation, an overall fine product.  Have not used the feature that let's you back-up your entire drive, but we use it in our LAN for shared files, and it's comforting to know that we've got these files stored redundantly.  This box does just what it claims to do, the warranty of merchantability (from my old law class!).
Very easy to assemble, has very classic lines, lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation, hard to find add-on shelf in maple. Holds a lot of equipment
The Edge 305 provides a wealth of knowledge, is easy to install, as well as use. I would love to have given it 5 stars (it deserves them), but one thing that does not work correctly, and really bugs me is the calories expended. It couldn't be more inaccurate if they tried to make it that way. The first day that I installed it, I took it for a quick 1 mile test ride. IT indicated that in that mile I burned 100+ calories. Wish it were true, but it is not. Unfortunetly the next day I was going to take it out on a 100 mile ride, but crashed as I started out and have not riden since (3 days). I wore the chest strap in the office today to test the calories burned further. After 2 hours it read 0 were burned. I just took it for a car ride of 7 miles. In those 7 miles DRIVEN IN A CAR, it indicates I burned nearly 600 calories, again I wish, but no way.Other than that flaw, whioh I hope they fix with a software update, I highly recommend this product, it all other ways it is great
Buying from Amazon was cheapest price especially with free shipping.  Stepped up for more power per channel.  Stayed in the Sony family. (Previous Sony surround, output to center speaker quit)  Dislike the speaker hook ups in back, difficult to attach speaker wires and screw down connections.  Overall happy with purchase
Very satisfied with sound quality and ease of use.  Before purchasing, I did believe that these were noise canceling.  However, that is not the case.  The foam inserts do reduce background noise enough that I am very satisfied with the result.  Replacement foam inserts must be purchased online
According to other reviews, this radio compares favorably with others in its price class.As a ham radio operator I can say I am very happy with the E5.  It is the best portable Broadcast band radio I have ever had.It is the best portable Shortwave radio I have ever had.I was particularly interested in SSB capability.  It works well.I called about the noisy power supply and they are sending me the improved replacement.  I use 2100 mah Nimh batteries which I charge externally.  I have two sets.  The radio works well with these.I found that the internal antenna by itself, indoors, is not enough.  I used the included wire antenna with moderately good results.  But more convient is using the telescoping antenna.  This antenna works, according to the manual, for FM and SW only, but I found that extending it fully, is effective in all cases.  Ressults using this method were similar to the wire.Holding the radio and using the headset may also improve reception.Hams know that the antenna is a critical part of any receiver.  There are limits to what is possible in a package this size.  I have not tested it with a tuned outdoor antenna.For what it is, this is a great tool.  It is a convient size and easy to program and use.  It more than meets my expectations.[...
I bought these for my dvd player.  They work wonderfully!  The old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but [didn't measure up}.  These monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies, especially the dialogue.  The old cables that I had made my movies sound a bit muffled.  But the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever.  For those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound, I would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or CDs
The Belkin TuneTalk is fabuous for using an iPod as a digital recorder. I have had very good results recording various music rehearsals (children's choir to big band) with and without an external powered microphone (Sony ECM-MS908C stereo mic) attached. Since I already had the mic, the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a Zoom digital recorder for this type of recording. I haven't plugged it into a mixing board yet. I suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a Mackie 1202 or better.I bought a USB power adaptor so I wouldn't have to worry about battery drain. It plugs into the TuneTalk and provides power to the iPod.No, it isn't as good as a high dollar recorder, dedicated mic-pre's and a pair of Neumann mics. Serious recording requires serious equipment. However, for all those other recordings, the Tunetalk Stereo is a great recording option for about $60 and your trusty iPod.
I lost my Monster Cable brand M to M cable for my ipod and looked for a different kind and ran across this one at half the price...plugged everything in and it works super-good sound quality and saved some bucks.  Hard to find these cables, so I highly recommend it
I saw the small size of this case and was in love.  It has plenty of space for dvds and cords (though it wont hold large headphones unless they fold).  It is padded enough for protection but not too padded to be too bulky.  It's Great.  You wont regret it. 
Great Price! Cant compare it to the more expensive "monster cables" but i cant imagine it being worth paying 50 dollars more for pretty much the same components
For its price and definately for its length, its an awesome alternative to it's $100 monster counterpart
I purchased three of these for three Kodak easyshare camerasI gave as gifts. It was a great buy for much less than whatyou can get at any local stores
 GOOD SOUND AND COMFORTABLE FOR THE PRICE . LIKE THE FACT THAT THE CORD IS ON ONE SIDE AND DOES NOT GO AROUND YOU NECK 
The best at this price. Like the color and functions. Mine has latest longer than some comparable higher end models. Life saver when trying to keep a busy life organized. Great optional backlight feature
when i first got this mp3 and opened up the box i was surprised how small it is.  about the size of a piece of chewing gum.  i installed the program via the included cd and it worked right away with no problem what so ever.  this held all the music i had on my lap top with lots of room to spare.  the program is easy to use and downloading music to the player is fast and easy.  the sound is outstanding with the ear-bud headphones that are included.  the fm works well and the display is back-light and very easy to read. all of the players options are user friendly and do not require a lot of skill to use.  this is one piece of electronics that will not drive you mad with hard to use software or directions.  as an added bonus they included batteries.  this is one of my favorite gadgets and i would recommend the 1 gig for any user.  it is not expensive at all and really who needs more music than this holds
I really needed a printer with a scanner so I could store my important files digitally.  This printer works great.. I would recommend to change to the lower resolution so it will operate faster.  It can scan color also but that takes a loooong time.  b has been sufficient for me; scans quickly for those.  printout quality is excellent
Good product, great combination of screen protection along with a small flexable piece to cover the keypad.
This is my second projector - I used an NEC for the last four years, but that died on me recently.  And, boy, am I glad it died - I am amazed by the quality of the AX100U - the pictures and colors almost  jump off the screen at you.  Also, the oft mentioned LDC projector 'screen door' effect is virtually non-existant - you have to stand almost next to the screen to notice it.  I believe Panny used some smoothening technology to achieve it.  The contrast is also truely outstanding for an LCD projector - at par with DLP systesm, but without the headaches of the rainbow effect.Couple of pointers which might be helpful to other users.  When I first started using the projector with my DVD player I was getting some wavy curls (not too visible, but still there) that seemed to flow across the screeen.  However, after about 4-5 hours of use, they have disappeared - so if any of you see those wavy curls, just give it a few hours and hopefully yours will disappear as well.Secondly, unlike my old NEC I was getting a flickering shimmer when using my HD box from my cable company.  The shimmer was just at the edge of teh picture.  There is an easy fix for this.  Go to options, overscan, and you can actually crop the edge of the image and  not see it any more...voila - no flickers and an incredible picture. Be aware that this is big, bulky projector compared to some others out there.  Definately not a portable one - you don't want to be lugging it home from work after presentations to see home pictures.  This was designed as a dedicated home theater projector, not a portable presentation device.  I highly recommend this projector - you've got to see the picture to believe it - I didn't think it was possible at this price range.
I was very surprised at how well this sub articulates the low frequencies.  Hearing is believing.  It gives a certain amount of accuracy and tangibility to base tones that I simply was not able to obtain with a higher priced sub I had purchased.  For movies, it does a wonderful job of augmenting the atmosphere of scenes without being too boomy.  It really enhances music by bringing out lower notes and sounds that are not normally perceived with the use of most other subwoofers on the market.  I am not certain it can go as low as 27Hz since I have not measured, but I am not concerned with trying to disturb the neighbors or shake the walls.  I just wanted to obtain the most precies and best sounding system I could.  I was able to do so with the addition of this sub.  I am glad I found and tried it before paying much more for another sub I was considering.Yet I hate the fact that it is advertised as being a 250-watt sub.  Its Peak Dynamic Power is 250 watts.  But the amplifier it contains is a 150 watt amplifier.  Therefore, it is a 150-watt sub
Pros: Very inexpensive, can play songs directly from a flash drive instead of an mp3 playerCons: Can't shuffle tracks or make a playlist if you use a flash driveOverall I'm very happy with this device. I live in a big city and had no trouble finding an FM station with little to no interference. I love being able to play tracks directly from a flash drive without having to bring my mp3 player with me in the car all the time. The sound quality is good, but not perfect. Similar to playing a cassette instead of a CD. For the low price, I can't complain, though
I purchased this remote to replace a broken tv/dvd/vcr combo remote.  Before buying it I checked specs of several brands and types to see if they could be programmed for my combo.  This was the only one that definitely could. It has worked well...a couple features are not available but I expect that with any replacement control.  I've also programmed it to my bose radio and my dish network box and the controls have worked just fine.  Now my coffee table is a lot less cluttered
I bought this card to be used with an IPAQ HW6945 it has enough capacity for GPS maps, programs and some music a 4 gb one would be great but it seems there is no 4gb card from Sandisk that is supported by the IPAQ. The reading / writing speed is ok too. Very good product for only 18 bucks
I purchased this particular CB because of the front firing speaker.  The size is perfect for IN dash installations, and it is very user friendly.  After installation I tested it out to 8 miles which was more then I expected.  Overall I'm very pleased with the price and quality of this product
ive owned a couple CB's and this is definitely one of the better ones (the only ones that are better are substancially more expensive).  works great and can be mounted in dash because of the front firing speaker.  tons of features including scanning and weather (which actually comes in very handy).  the only feature it lacks (and i wish it had) is the ability to hook up to a PA.  other than that its great
Very very loud-enough to make you're ears ring (thats a good sign)Bass is very deep and the silver volume dots on one of the speakers are touch sensitive like the ipod-now thats cool.Great great desktop speakers, and they can hook up right to your ipod. Worth the money
Well-made hard case that is virtually a necessity to protect the Tungsten E2 which comes with a flimsy, cheap flip case
I have to say this mouse pad has far exceeded anything I hoped for. When I first opened the box it was shipped in I was very put off. There was a Very, Very strong chemical smell. I chalked it up to something in the packaging material. It turns out that was not where the smell was coming from. It was the mouse pad itself. Having worked in a shoe factory years ago I was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue. The smell hung around for a couple of days. Now, 1 week after having received my purchase if I put my nose close to the pad, it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue. I would caution those with allergies and/or asthma to consider this prior to purchase. As an asthmatic I can say it did affect my breathing some what. That seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened. I have finished with my public health warning. On to the mouse pad.      It is simply the best mouse pad I have ever used. I have had wrist problems for over 4 years now. I have had swelling and pain from my right pinkie finger to my elbow as a result of console gaming and lots of keyboarding work. In the past week my swelling has greatly reduced. My pain is almost gone. My wrist sits perfectly on  the wrist rest. The pad actually cradles my wrist. The wrist rest moves with my hand, so well and with so much support, it seems to be an extension of my body. A new improved appendage. I have found myself resting my wrist on the pad even while not computing but just sitting at my desk. It truly is that comfortable. I already have plans to purchase two more for friends as Christmas gifts. Worth Every Cent! Go For It! You Will Not Be Disappointed! 
Great Sound.  Fun colored lights.  Great Design.  Love this radio
We love this tuner, and the kids have had funfinding out what key different sounds make.They change their voice, tap on things with pencils, etc.
I bought this mouse for my fiancee about three months ago and she has not complained once. She uses it extensively in her office and reports that it is accurate, comfortable, and looks sharp
One lvel up from the ES30VS, much more capable of the last generation the ES35VS is a versatile unit capable of handling all home recording needs and MOST professional needs as well, remote control is easier to use than the last generation, the addition of the DVI input gives it ease of recording from Camcorders with a clikc of a button, I am VERY happy with this uni
It was easy to set up and use. Our remote was bad out of the box but Panasonic sent us a replacement.We were able to record tv programs right away and then transferred our old VHS over to DVD.It took a long time to transfer but it was worth watching the VHS tapes again to bring back memories.
Does exactly what it's supposed to do.  I live 30 miles from the stations and have a good amount of tress surrounding my house, but I still receive all the network channels and their subchannels perfectly.  Easy to install, too
I have this console for protection of master bedroom 40" LCD Samsung 1080p HDTV and Denon surrond sound 7.1 home theater system. I have been very pleased with the improved picture and sound. Before hooking up to this console, I had a slight wave going across the screen. It is now gone as is the slight buzz from the sound system.I also have 1-2 power outages every month from new construction in our area. The console has protected all of the equipment very well. Considering the price and free shipping through Amazon, I highly recommend this console
My company purchased two of these phone a month or two back for office use.  Previously we had an AT - which I'll probably never own again after having a Panasonic.The phones have great voice quality - plus some nice features you don't always find, like the hold option, data port on the back, and a nice LCD screen displaying date, time, # missed calls, # messages, and in call timer.  I do wish, however, that the LCD was backlit.  Another great feature is the fact that it displays the associated caller ID stamp with the message that is playing - no more guessing who left the message when!The phones have been standing up beyond our expectations - and I plan on buying Panasonic phones our next time around
It's a good quality notebook bag that can fit 17" laptops/notebooks easily. Balances well on your shoulder (unlike some bags that rest lopsided). Good, strong stitch. It can get heavy, but then again you're carrying around a 17" laptop
I needed extra space for pictures and musis downloads this was just right not too expensive and large enought to fit the purpose
I gave a detailed review of the base system, but the handset merits comments separately.  I have purchased handsets for every room in the house, and because I don't like using the clip to carry it with me everywhere, I use them.  They're easily customizable through the PC interface, although they can be customized without it as well.  Each handset gets its out name, so transferring calls or paging a handset is simple.  (No more trying to remember which room has the "fifth" handset.)  I've been impressed with both the battery life and the range of each handset; I've read reviews that criticized the range or sound quality, but I've had no trouble with either despite a few different usage scenarios.  If you're shopping for one of these, then you've already got the base unit or are considering purchasing it, so you know the quality to expect.  I think the Uniden CLX485 is the best residential phone system I've ever experienced; the handset lives up to that standard, too
This antenna is one of the best indoor UHF antennas, but is designed for UHF only.  Many cities use both UHF  VHF for digital TV.  To see if UHF  VHF are used in your area, enter your address at www.antennaweb.org Then, look at the digtal channel Frequency assignments column.  If any channels are 2 thru 13, this antenna is not for you.Do NOT buy any knockoff antennas sold by TERK.  They are mostly junk.
The mounting kit installed easily and is holding a pair of Bose 151 speakers.  It works well for what I need
Excellent value for money. My razr is a fully functional mp3 player now! Thanks. :
2GB SanDisk is awesome. I can store lots of files in my PDA and not worry about space. Also the price was very afordable
A fast card which works as expected.You don't know the difference a fast card can make, unless you swap to a slower one. Even a slower camera/device will have improved performance with a faster card such as this one.Enjoy
This memory card has not given us any trouble.  Very reliable product.  Highly recommend
Plenty of room for our HPA612 printer and a friend bought the same one for her HPA617.  Pockets for extra paper.  Shoulder strap for even more ease in transporting the printer. 
When the room temperature hot and no one else wants the Air Conditioner turned on, this Desktop Air Conditioner cools just my 7 feet by 7 feet personal space.  It's heaven.  I wouldn't be without. This is my second order
I really enjoyed this product and the fact that its simple to use!! It clips nicely onto my laptop or I can take it off, it comes with a little protective case, and the lens slides in to keep it unexposed when you're not using.  I really like it and all its features as well
I bought these after buying TDK for the past 5 years and now only being able to get Memorex at a low price (I've had very bad experiences with Memorex CDRs in the past). These were surprisingly cheap as Verbatim is one of the highest quality blank media brands. Not surprisingly, the discs lived up to expectations on my Plextor-716A drive. I haven't tested a whole lot yet, but the ones I did test, burn flawlessly and when disc scans were run, there were no errors. You really can't go wrong with Verbatim. Just buy them
I exchange audio letters with friends, and this stereo recorder was purchased after my Sony 100 DVS died and no replacement parts were available. The sound quality is perfectly fine, though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high-end machine. It comes with a stereo microphone, but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit -- as it is, there is a long clip-on cord. This makes it tough to do "off-the-cuff" recording. Overall, a good value for the money. The other machine cost nearly $300.
I bought this so I can transfer video from my Panasonic PV-GS300 camcorder to my PC.  Installation was easy and my computer was up and running in a matter of minutes.  The is a great value considering they include a 6-pin to 4-pin firewire cable too.  I highly recommend this product
So this controller looked pretty sweet to me so I bought it over a rumble pad. I liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat, as I tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers. I bought this controller specifically for Star Wars Battlefront 2 on PC, and it works like a dream. I also like the X-Box controller layout (offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic) than the PS2 style controller that is the Logitech Rumble pad. It also has better grips than a PS2 controller.The only things I think are bad about it are the following:1. It is not modeled on the large XBox controller, but rather the regular one, which is ok for most people, but I have big hands and I get a bit cramped up if I play for way too long.2. I was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad. I have a Saitek Cyborg EVO joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game. This isn't an issue with Battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator, but I could see where if a game didn't have as good an interface (or maybe older games) this pad could suffer in this regard.3. This isn't so much an issue for me, but I would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan, that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out. I don't care too much, because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything. I will still use it even if it does die.Overall, a great controller, I actually would give it a 4.5 rating, but that isn't an option here
 I needed a sub for my garage, and did not want to spend more than $200. Got it on sale for well under that. Since this was just for the garage, when tinkering with my bikes, I didn't want something too expensive, and didn't expect much from such a small sub. I was very pleasantly suprised by it's performance, This thing will rock when needed, and hits suprisingly low for a small sub in a very large space.  I first tried a Polk PSW10, since Polk products had never dissapointed me in the past. Well there is always a first time... The Yamaha smokes the Polk sub, I returned the Polk immediatly.  Of couse it doesn't compare with the Energy S12.3 I use in my main music system, but for 1/5 the cost, I never expected it to
Maybe I'm bias because I really like Yamaha, maybe, because I have kinda' good ears or, it's the fat check sitting on my table  from Yamaha; but what ever it is I realllllllly like this sub-woofer. I looked around a long time for the right sub, and, I like to think I got a good one here. You want power? Ok, it's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like Velodyne, but in my room (30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling) it ROCKS. I love music, all kinds; loud or quiet no matter I like both, but I do like depth more than volume. However, I believe if you are going to listen to something real loud, being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it.And let me say you can FEEL music if you want to. one of the things I love most about this sub is it's range; it can (maybe) reach 20 hertz. 20 hertz! that is astounding.20Hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear, in fact it's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard.Maybe I have good ears and maybe I don't, but to hear rich airy low-end, and, bass notes. yes! bass NOTES! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise, it's huge, open, grazing pasture of distinct sounds!In short, music sounds great, even hip-hop (which I don't like) sounds, well, better.Also, their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement; at very quiet levels too, you can hear good clean bass notes. But, if you do a lot of quite listening, we're talking back ground music levels: disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off, because if you happen to be listening to something quiet, even if you still can here low notes from this, it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on, well... on. It improves movies as well, take something  with a lot of dynamics like, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" or, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" there are a lot of sudden loud, and very low sounds in those movie's and the Yamaha handles it all with aplomb. With most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy, and if you are wondering about the "BASS" button: if the button is in the "music" position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the "movie" position (I think "music" is a flatter frequency response). As this review seems to be getting a bit long I'll some it up:yes, there are far better subwoofers out there (like from B), but I don't have the money for those, and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt Velodyne I would take it in a heartbeat- but, I wouldn't want to give this one up too.It's a absolute pleasure to listen to.Update: I have run some test tones on this subwoofer, and well, it can not reach 20Hz. 38Hz seems to be the limit for usable bass, although it is still audible to around 32Hz, 20Hz is a stretch.If 38Hz sounds to high: their are not many movie's or CD's that have any sounds below 35Hz. And very, very few have sound below 25Hz.Although it does not go as low as I would have hoped, it is still a good sub for the money, and still worth a five star review
I purchased this for my wife who wanted a case for her HP Pavilion Notebook PC (DV5139US), screen size 15.4", ht 1.8", wdth 14.1", depth 10.4 ". The bag is for personal use, not business, and use will be moderate. She did want some extra compartments for organization. This case has met all her needs, it is light weight, constructed of durable material, well organized. Her notebook fits in this top loading case with ease. She is satisfied with this purchase. We would recommend purchasing this case.
A great product - snug fit on the laptop, and appears to be a part of the laptop itself. Difficult to remove, but no real reason to remove it anyway.
I can verify again that this is indeed 16 gauge wire. This size works very well for small-medium satellite speakers. I am using this wire with a Samsung HT-Q80 HTIB. It's working wonderfully and I'm getting nice crisp sound. Unlike the other reviewer, my spool came fully intact. I would suggest this for anybody looking for good, cheaply priced 16 gauge speaker wire
If you zoom in on the picture, you'll notice that it's actually 16 gauge wire.  I received it and can confirm that it's 16 gauge.  Wire works fine, although the spool that's held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing.  It's not a big deal though, and my only disappointment was on my end when I realized 100' wasn't enough to hook up my 7 speakers
The card is blistering fast.  I just wish it didn't take a performance hit in Vista.  It also has several other odd issues that I've become accustomed to when buying bleeding edge technology.  (e.g. the official drivers released in February 2007 are missing several features in Windows Vista.  Like good TV-Out support, Hibernation support, proper Ntune support.  The March 2007 released Vista beta drivers seems to cause a lot of people to have video driver crashes during games.  Check Nvidia's message board for more info.)Once Nvidia straightens out their Vista drivers issues, this card will be golden.  As it is, the latest Beta drivers did improve performance... but it introduced some stability issues.Also, EVGA's 90-day Step-Up program will hopefully allow me to jump into the 8900 series that is rumored to be released late-April 2007.LASTLY... it puts off an odd digital whine in 3D games and when resizing windows.  I returned one (with green circuitboard) and got a new one form Amazon (black circuitboard) and it did the same thing.  Amazon reimbursed me the return shipping!  The digital whine isn't too bad, but its fairly annoying if you have your game sound really low.  I play with headphones, so I don't really care
This is a great little machine and has so many uses.  I bought 2 of them and 2 days later came back to Amazon to buy some more for gifts and the price has doubled... what's with that?  Keep looking and you'll find this at a hot price again eventually
Never having had any other headphones I don't really know how to compare these, but the speakers definetely work fine and I can identify different directions' sounds... but there is a small crackling in the background that won't go away and I can't find out why
As headphones they work fine but the microphone falls off repeatedly and this appears to be the result of a bad design.  After the 10th time the Microphone failed entirely and refuses to work.  I've isolated the problem to the microphone itself.  As headphones they are fine but in you need a microphone you should look elsewhere.  
I received them OK none broken or cracked. This price beats Walmarts price and these cases are as good as any slim cases I have ever used. I like the translucent back better than the black ones at Staples
In general, Lexar's USB drive does its job just as well as other USB drives; there isn't much of a difference except for the following:1) portability good: it has a convenient way of attaching to your keychainbad: this rubber holder only lasts for so long (in my case 6-8 months)2) it is extremely durable. This drive survived a full 30 minute (clothes) washer cycle. When I took it out of the washer, I thought all the data and the drive was gone for good. To my surprise (after letting it dry for a day) it worked just fine. This is amazing!I have also accidentally stepped on it while wearing shoes (not using all of my weight though) a few times on carpet and concrete; and still works fine.Finally, I have dropped this drive on a variety of surfaces and it's still fine.3) looks:good: it is very easy to see since it is bright redbad: it is fatter than other USB drives and it is bright red. The drive is pretty ugly.It maybe good to note however, that the drive's structure is probably a good reason as to why it has survived my abuse. The bright red color's advantage has already been mentioned above
This is great.  It makes it easier for us all to listen to the music in the car
Bueno esta Quemadora Dvd muy buena recomendable, para los usuarios que quieran vivir una experiencia unica, es la mejor que ha existido, gracias amazon por vender productos de vanguardi
Before adding this antenna to my wireless router, I had unreliable connections.  Since adding it, I consistently get the high speed connection I'm paying for. 
I was a little worried about spending almost 70$ on this bag, but when I recieved it I was so impressed.  I really love this bag! Very well made!! The crocadile pattern is a lot more prominent than the picture shows, but I really like it. To be honest I shy away from croc patterns, but it really works with this bag! I have a 15.4 in. Gateway laptop and it fit perfectly in this bag
This bag is just pefect! I purchased it for my Dell Inspiron 6400 and, although the fit was pretty snug, I am very pleased with the purchase. It is easy to carry and above everything else, is very stylish and professional.
Excellent service, but I expected to see another model of the handbag. It looked different on the picture
I have used this machine for a few months now, but have not made use of all possible features. However, this is what I can say:* basic copying, fax, scanning -- Excellent* scanning with character recognition -- Excellent but would prefer to have options ala OmniPage* duplex printing(printing on both sides) -- Very Good, except the menu digging is ackward* build quality and overall performace -- Excellent, prints fast, few jams, feels very sturdy* ease of use -- very good and straight forward* features -- Excellent, loaded with capabilitiesThis machine is beautiful and no other machine I have used comes close, save for high end office machines costing $thousands. I can't get over how happy I am with this one, I've been waiting for a quality MFC since before they came out, and finally I am satisfied. Highly recommended
A great addition to the iH5 radio!  You could do without it, but being able to adjust volume from across my apartment is a great feature
I travel overseas a lot for my job. This little power strip is compact and enables you to keep ONE adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your "normal" plugs for operating four devices. Most Monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money (wires, cables, etc.) but this gizmo rocks
We've only had ours a week and I wish we'd bought it sooner.  The photos are sharp and every bit as good as commercially printed ones.  I like it that they are dry and can be handled right away unlike my big HP printer's photos which stay sticky for some time.Having this gives such freedom to print and print photos to enclose in letters, to use in scrapbooking, and to frame for your home or for gifts.  Really convenient and takes very little space on the desktop
I'm a college kid, recreational audiophile and bass fanatic, studying engineering.  I started off building a custom sub encloser with dual Kicker CompVR 12" subs driven by a 1200W Sony amp. I haven't stopped searching for great sound since.I'm running a pair of these off an H/K AVR240, combined with a JBL EC35 center, a JBL S120PII 400w sub, and two sets of E30 surrounds.I'm big on trying anything before I buy it.  I was able to listen to these and the E80s (the dual 6" floorstandings) at a local audio store before they were discontinued.  I loved the sound of these and the Polk and Klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics. With the JBLs at a fraction of the price here on Amazon, it was no question.  The only issue was what model to get...I heard very little difference in qualtiy between the E60s and E80s.  The dual 6" put out a bit lower frequencies, but the difference was so small that I wouldn't be able to notice without the speakers side by side.  Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful, but a bit overkill for what I needed.  I deceided on these over the E60s with the hopes that a single 8" would draw less from my amp than the dual 6" for a bit less money.Beautiful home theater and music speaker...crisp highs, defined mids, and respectable bass.  They are a bit top heavy, as any tower will be.  and I love extremely low, loud bass, and as such, I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub.Movies sound great:Saving Private Ryan, Fifth Element, 40 year old virgin, Anchorman, etc... etc...Music is also fantastic (with different amp settings tuned for genre):Ambient, electronica, hip-hop, rap, jazz, 80s, classical, rock.Ulrich Schnauss, Bonobo, DJ Shadow, Busta, Snoop, E40, Louis Armstrong, Michael Jackson, Bach, Korn, Metallica, Hoobastank, 311.If you're looking for a quality tower speaker... this is it.Bass fanatics, look at the S120PII.  you won't regret it.~shakas~ 
Like the name suggests, the m-audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles.  I have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money.  The audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion.  I connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my Harman Kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear.  The one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first.  However, when quality is essential go with the Audiophile 2496. 
I have owned this backpack for almost two years and have put thousands of miles on it in NYC (my home town) and traveling on business across the US.A place for everything and everything in its place.First this thing has 3 major compartments and a 4th 'open' compartment; A padded laptop compartment large enough for a Mac 17" with enough room left over of books or magazines. The second compartment has an internal file folder compression panel, that keeps your paperwork flat, orderly and compressed against your body(If you ever had the paper clip come off of a 40 page document in your backpack you know how great this feature is). The final main compartment contains an integrated open-top mesh bag for your power brick and other miscellaneous computer gear. Again this has been designed to keep the weight compressed and close to your body. Each compartment has plenty of extra room beyond its required purpose. The forth 'open' compartment is stiff outer panel with a compression draw strings around the sides in which you can stuff: your book, newspaper, umbrella, rain jacket, lunch, magazine, camera, iPod or anything you need to securely stash away and retrieve at a moments notice while on the go. A great feature! Finally this rig is fitted out with no less than 5  additional zippered pockets and 4 pockets-inside-of-pockets AND: a separate gear bag, as well as a CD-ROM sleeve and a removable cell phone pocket on the shoulder strap.The styling is professional enough of serious meetings. You can also carry the bag to the side with its well padded handle. This is key in elevators and subways.All and all you can load this down for a 3 day road trip and it still feels solid and balanced on your back. Final notes: - Zippers are high quality with big rubber grips- The black  grey color scheme will not show dirt and wear.- Fits snug under airline seats- Good padding on shoulders and back panel.- Did I mention all the pockets?Any down side?Having this bag becomes an exercise in self control for pack-rats. When full this bag is BIG. But if you don't mind looking looking geeky and knocking people over when you turn around fill it up and your good to go. Other wise just limit your stuff.
The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars is because I have only taken it on the road once, so as of yet I can't call it a worthy 'road warrior.' However, it is certainly a great case. Proportioned well and good design, with space for essentials. Would recommend for anyone looking for a good case for their 17" widescreen notebook
I bought this for my husbands birthday.  He was very excited.  He had been looking at bags at a local store and hadn't found anything as nice as this, especially for the price.  Plenty of room for his laptop and pens, notebooks, extra books, etc.  Very durable, highly recommend
I love the JLab MiniBlaster because no matter where I go I can have my favorite music with me.  The sound is clear and I found this product easy to use. I will be giving several of these for holiday gifts and birthday presents to friends and relatives, young and old.  The delivery was prompt, and I appreciated the friendly customer service in response to my questions
The cable set that comes in this item is what ought to have been included in the Airport Express.  This comes with a 2 meter RCA-ministereo, a 2 meter Optical-ministereo, and a 6ft power cable.  I found that both the RCA and Optical cables worked flawlessly with my receiver.  I wish that the power cable was a little longer and I would've liked to have received a white ethernet cable to complete this set.  The installation of any of these cable went very easily with the on caveat that you must ensure to remove the covers on the optical cable which may not be obvious to some
My engineering classes don't allow for the TI-83,86,89.  So I needed a calculator that allowed for matrix reduction, basic vector manipulation, and single variable integration for my engineering class.  The matrix reduction capabilities has been a major time saver especially on tests, particularly for solving systems of linear equations especially in my Statics, Dynamics, and Strength of Materials Class.  The "2-Line Natural Textbook Display" prevents me from getting lost in a calculation with multiple parenthetically nested expressions and is a must have.  The "scrolling" ability to grab values from previous calculations saves time and preserves accuracy, very nice.  The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that I thought the exterior design make is awkward to use at times, but that is because I'm used to square calculators.  Also I would have like this model offered in black
It is a good universal remote control, I had several but this is the only one that could realy controles my TV wel
Theis is a small manuverable mouse.  I especially like it for playing games since it is very quick. I had one before and I would buy another if this one quits
I lost my original stylus (left it at a restaurant).  This replacement pack of styli are just like my original.  I have none of the problems the other reviewer had.  My stylus fits perfectly, and the telescoping top is just like my original.  This is a great replacement
I've used the SD-YD250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear. Overall, the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor-saving convenience. I've used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough. It can also save a lot of money, provided you purchase the yeast in bulk (for example 2lb). The single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at American supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram. Particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough. This takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza, and when the dough is refrigerated for later use, it tastes even better in my opinion.Like most engineered products of our age, this one is full of cute features that add little value, or cause annoyance.The yeast dispenser makes a marginal difference at best. If you use it, you (for the most part) create extra work for yourself because you'll have to clean it later. The dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use. They make a marginal difference in baking results. I only use the quick bake mode, which takes 2 hours to complete. Let's say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings (easy to do given the many parameters you can set). You just push the reset or cancel button and start over, right? Nope, no such button exists. Then unplug the unit and plug it back in, right? Nope, the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages, so the unit remembers where it left off. Yes, but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes, and after 10 minutes it will forget, right? Nope, I tried this, too. The unit does indeed forget eventually, but it's more than 11 minutes. If you plug it back too early, the timer resets and you have to wait again.To summarize, the hardware is excellent, and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber
This carry case is great. It would be even greater if it had a carry strap
OEM charger failed. Replaced with this one -- it's more compact  functions well
This product works great for my ibook G4 screen and also for cleaning off most smudges on the case, although it seems like I'm constantly getting new smudges on the screen.  Don't expect it to get off the spots that build up on keyboard over time, though.  Mr. Clean Magic Eraser works well for that ... but only if you make sure to thoroughly squeeze the water out before use on your computer.  Otherwise it may get in and ruin your keyboard
My 2 year old saw this in BJs and kept asking for it, so Santa brought it for him for Christmas. I think it's a good first guitar. He loves to strum it, but he definitely needs to be supervised to teach him to respect that it is a special musical instrument, not a toy. So far he has sat on it and used it as a drum and it's held up fine, but I don't think it would hold up with such continued abuse. It is recommended for children much older than he is, so I can't expect anything different. I do wish they made a smaller version of it so it would be more comfortable for him. For a better price than I see at Amazon, you can get a small Hohner guitar at a music store, which might be better quality, I'm not sure. Regardless, I am very happy with this guitar and I would recommend it for any child who shows a real interest in music. I would not buy it for a child just as a toy, unless you don't mind it being destroyed. I am planning to buy the guitar strap and will review that when I get it
I have both the 4 port and 2 port versions of these and they seem to work well with my Dell Optiplex 260 running Windows XP. My PowerEdge 500sc, 1400, and 1800 tend to lose the mouse and keyboard and have to be rebooted, but this may be a function of running Windows 2003 R2 on them. Also, the 1800 has a Promise SATA card which locks up with USB in general making this switch a problem (I had to go back to the PS2 KVM).  But with XP machines it seems fine
The connectpro USB KVM Switch costs a few dollars more but it really works the first time with no hassles.  I've been forced to use cheaper KVM switches at work and Windows XP never seems to play nice with them.  I use this one at home with two Linux machines and a desktop and laptop running Windows XP.  The switch worked the first time I connected everything together and has worked glitch free ever since
Works just as expected.  Switches quickly among two desktop machines and a laptop (all running WinXP).  Each machine takes  1 min to recognize, same as when plugging in any new USB device.  Very durable cables.  Was concerned about using wireless keyboard/mouse, but works great with the Microsoft Wireless Desktop, including the multimedia function keys.  Version of the switch that I received is black, not white as pictured
speakers give good sound quality and are small and unnoticeable at a good price all the things I was looking for in speake
I bought this switch last week. The installation was as easy as plug n play. No major problems so far. This switch is worth its price
I have bought this for about 8pp in my office for their Black and White desktop printer.  So far NOT ONE problem.  The toner is long-lasting and affordable.  Great quality- small desktop footprint.  Does a great job with envelopes, labels and even light cardstock.I would highly reccommend to anyone
This Eton radio is the U.S. domestic version of the Chinese Tecsun PL-550 all-band pocket sized radio. The Chinese version is legended in the native language and utilitarian in appearance and less expensive. The Eton is, well, in English with slight curves. I have used and tested other Tecsun produced radios, including the PL-200 (Eton 10) and the Grundig eTraveller VII. This radio, like the other Tecsun models, has excellent frequency discrimination, as well as the ability to directly enter the frequency desired (if you know it), or scan through the AM, FM and many shortwave bands, find the stations you like and store their frequencies. Closely allied, for example, FM stations within 200 kHz (only the strongest will be heard on most commercial FM receivers) of each other, can be picked up with clarity, positioning the manuverable whip antenna. Very, very few radios, excepting expensive car radios, can boast such performance in the Unites States.  Now on the market are other comparable radios, all made by Tecsun in China using the very same sophisicated reception circuitry regelated previously to expensive shortwave receivers.  This model has other features as well:  two preset wake-up times for programs from preselected stations, scanning of all bands for stations and an antenna trimmer which permits optimizing reception on weakly received broadcasts, some 500 station memories and special reception selectivity for shortwave stations whose frequencies are almost overlapping.  For the price, this radio is simply an excellent value, but people wishing to receive shortwave broadcasts are warned:  shortwave reception from this radio, and every other shortwave radio for that matter, of stations other than the powerful broadcasters, benefits enormously from the use of an external long wire antenna.  Tecsun does provide a retractable wire antenna with the radio.  Alas, as with almost all radios this size, there is no single side band (SSB) reception, an enhancement that, defying digital technology, actually requires listener intervention to optimize and has great potential, but has, for the present at least, been consigned to the province of the technical listener more interested in ascertaining distant reception than actual broadcast information. The Dalai Lama for all his 5,000 watts SSB from Tibet can not be heard on this radio. China Radio shortwave, at 150,000 watts conventiona AM shortwave, with Canadian relay stations, does just fine. Australian radio, at the same power, Radio Havana, Radio Serbia, Croatia, Russia, Netherlands, Sweden, India, Israel, etc., at lesser power, and some with and most without relay stations, are also heard clearly on the Eastern seaboard during their times of broadcast - usually in the early evening EST
I've had my E-10 for around nine months and have been most impressed by it's performance. My interests in radio pretty much revolve around A.M.(or medium wave) DX'ing and shortwave listening. It's performance on A.M. is on a par with the highly regarded Kaito KA-1103 which I received for Christmas this year. Shortwave performance is very close, however, the Kaito is superior in this area (and features SSB tuning as well)F.M.? The E-10 is well above average but falls short of the Kaito KA-1103. I've yet to see a radio that can equal the Kaitos performance in this area, but the E-10 is closer than most.Build quality,ergonomics,and appearance are second to NONE and better than MOST. The slightly rubberized texture of this set just plain feels good when handling and adds to the to the overall impression that this is a "Top of the line" portable multi band receiver even though it's moderately priced.It's LCD digital display is one of the largest and nicest I've seen,very easy to see and well lit with a pleasant orange backlight. Other amenities such as 500 plus memories,12/24 hour clock,I.F. shift and antennae trim which are both useful in Shortwave reception,local/dx switch and the internal battery charger for NICAD or NIMH batteries all add up to make this a radio I'm glad I purchased and often recommend to those needing a radio of this type.Even the accessories included with this radio such as the carrying satchel,earbuds,and reel-up shortwave antennae are top notch! Now, if you're wondering why, after all this praise I only gave it a four star rating,and not a five it's because Eton did not provide SSB tuning capability on this receiver. And it's a shame because it's shortwave performance is good enough to utilize it. In my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio. Hence they only "hit a triple"(which is way more exciting nonetheless, I'm a baseball nut too) and not a home run
I only have a couple of problems with this remote. You have to keep pressing the buttons for dvd, vcr, audio, sat, etc. to change the setting. That sounds like I'm complaining a lot, and I am. (sue me. ha ha) The other is this. I bought this as a replacement for a remote that quit working. I can't teach it the functions that I need through the "learn" command since the orginal remote quit. Which kind of defeats the purpose of having a new remote. I have one of those all in in one home theater units and the remote wouldn't allow me to set the VCR clock and local channels after a power outage. Other than that, I have no problem with it
My husband and father both have this unit. It's really handy to have on road trips and to use while Geocaching. From our experience, it does take a while to download map information onto the unit, and a color screen would be nice, but for $200, I think it's a good value
Actually, I loved the Philips Acoustic Edge, an earlier and internal sound card, but it did not like my older dual-processor system.  Because of that I was a bit skittish about using their current internal card with a processor that uses hyper-threading - which Windows treats as dual processors.  I bought the Aurelium instead.  I love this thing!  I am a bit of an audiophile, and this sound card is just perfect.  With my Klipsch computer speakers, it makes a perfect combination
A nice little radio. Good sound for the price. I like the easy-to-read station indicator.
I love this item.  We bought 2 cases for our sons before we left for vacation.  It can hang from the seats but they just held them on their lap or layed it on the couch in the van.  The boys arranged everything in the case so the battery even fits in it.  I was glad about that.  I'd recommend this item.
The case was very well made and sturdy. Unfortunatly it was too small for my sony 7 in DVD portable player. Returning it to amazon was quick and easy. I wish it would have fit.
I just recently bought a sub-woofer and I spent a good deal of time searching for an interconnect. The interconnects I looked at ranged from ridiculously over-priced to questionably cheap. I knew I wanted it to be THX certified and of a length that would allow me some freedom of sub-woofer placement. This interconnect provided both at a very reasonable price. I must say after installing my subwoofer that this cable was a perfect choice. Some might say that the cost reflects a cables ability to provide good sound. Wrong. This is just as good as those 70 dollar interconnects. I do buy monster cable for most of my home theatre needs, but I do not buy into some of the hype surrounding Monster cable and their more expensive cables. Why only 4 and not 5 stars. I did not like the way the cable was packaged. The cable was folded down the middle and now the center of the cable has a crook in it. I would have perfered it to be wound around a plastic spool to avoid folding of the cable. Getting past that, its a good interconnect that produces great sound.
This is actually the second RCDW500C I have purchased.  The first is still working, but it has so many miles on it that I wanted to have a back-up ready when it is time to be replaced.  Sony electronics, in my experience, are some of the toughest in the business.  The old unit may last a lot longer.  I am on my third Sony TV in the last thirty five years; the second is still working for the person I finally gave it to.I am very comfortable with the technology of the RCDW500C.  Once learned, this unit is a dream to operate.  It is user friendly, displaying all of the info the user needs for optimum use.  If you have questioins, the manual is well written, and will usually enable the user to solve any problems.  Sony is a very reputable company.  In my humble opinion, Sony has been out in front of virtually all of their competitors for a long time.  Their products have always been a good investment for me.
This is a great product for your mini.  The armband is well-constructed from a neoprene-type material (which doesn't slip when you're sweaty) with heavy-duty velcro all the way around, and the ipod holder is securly screwed onto it.  The rubberized skin keeps your iPod safe from sweat and provides some shock and scratch resistance.This isn't a super-cheap armband, but as they say, you (usually) get what you pay for.  This should last you for years of gymming / running / biking
very good product.. actually came with a bonus 8 cd sleeve to attach to a car visor for free. very happy with the produc
I just received these and popped 'em in and I'm listening to MP3s on my PC.  At first, one of sides was really weak in volume.  In the process of testing the balance in my software, I accidentally cranked up the volume way to high for these guys, but that apparently did the trick.  Now both are equal, and sound good.  There is decent bass, but the highs are a bit soft.  A quick tweak to my equalizer, and they're great.  After reading several of the reviews on Amazon, I was a bit worried about the sound, but now that I have them I'm very happy.  They're a good price, and sooooo much better than the little ipod-like earbuds I've tried before.  Those never stayed in my ear, and the bass never made me happy.  Summary:These Jbuds stay in my ear, have good sound (not great, but I think good for $20), and have equal length cords from each ear
 I have just started with an Apple ipod nano product and was not impressed with the factory included ear buds at all. They didn't sound real good and didn't come supplied with the ear bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your ears. What's the deal with that? Next came the old Sony MDR 027 head phones from the closet. The Sony's have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the ears now. They worked o.k., I guess, but in comparison these JBuds sound MUCH better than either of the previous ones. I'm now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine. I'm hearing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models. Crisper highs, great mid range, and responsive lows. Set up was fast too, just find the correct size ear bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running. The JBuds actually stay in your ear. Wow what a concept. They are also very comfortable due to the fact I forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing. The cord is just the right length for setting the ipod on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket. If you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie. Better too much than not enough. So back to the closet with the Sony.   I guess what it all boils down to is you could do a whole lot worse than these especially for a mere twenty bucks. I couldn't have made a better choice for the money and quality. You should do the same.  Another quick note. The shipping went great. Not too long at all and with standard USPS. Thanks Amazon
It can transfer Flash drive  SD card to a car mp3 player. That's very nice. I love it..
Wonderful.  Holds all my songs, holds my books on tape so I can listen on the road.  Photos are large and sharp.  Very easy to use and easy to download. The dials are excelent, on-off and volume work flawlessly.  I have many products such as car adapter, speakers, external charger, and external microphone and all work great.  I highly recommend the unit.  I would never get less then 60 gigs, plenty of space for all of my needs.  On my recent trip to California this was the only thing I took for entertainment; never listened to a song twice
This is my second one of this model, I burned up the first myself when we moved and I accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it (too much voltage = smoke).  I found it easy to configure, set up WEP keys, MAC locked everything using the web-based interface.  It worked great with our LinkSys Media extender - we watch recorded tv from our Media Center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device.  No problems whatsoever.  Hasn't slowed down my internet connection either.  I am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work. 
I've been in the newspaper business for many years, and I've always used recorders at governmental meetings, interviews, etc. -- much easier and faster than taking notes, and it allows me to focus more on my subject. Until now, I've never had a recorder that could pick up everything without a lot of background noise or without having to turn the tape over or replace it in the midst of the event. This little Sony is the perfect size, picks up everything without all that background noise and plays it back crystal clear. Additionally, it has a long battery life, and I never run out of room while I'm taping. I couldn't ask for more
Out of the box and into the attic.  Followed the instructions and I'm receiving perfect signals for my 46" SONY HDTV set from Pensacola, FL (approx 20 miles) and Mobile, AL (approx 50 miles).  I did read the instructions and followed them, I believe the folks that aren't happy with this model didn't read and follow the instructions
unlike most tech gadgets that are a little outdated, this product stands in nearly every aspect. The sleek, supreme design by F.A. Porsche makes this product appearance timeless, and its preformance is outstanding, more effective in this model than its smaller, slower (80Gb, 120 Gb) counterparts. The autostart is a little slow for me (its the USB model, not firewire, remeber), but is a totally acceptable feature for the price, design  performance cost-benefit equilibrium. Excellent purchase
He estado disfrutando de este tv por alredeor de 5 dias, la imagen es muy buena, facil de instalar, lo unico que se deberia mejorar es el sonido. 
The GOOD: We plugged in our new LNS2651D on 3/7/7, about an hour northwest of Tampa Bay.  Right out of the box,with an old Rabbit Ear antenna, we received five HD broadcasts.  The picture is amazing in both color and clarity.  The BAD: We reset the sound coming directly from its speakers, but because of speaker location underneath/below the screen,it lacks sparkle, esp at low to med. volume. The UGLY:  Imagine sending your intelligent,pretty young daughter out on her first date, with shoveled-on make-up, and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress.  The "Piano Black" case on this tv is a nightmare!  It shows a rippled effect, which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines (even lightly) on it.  I'm hoping after the R department who designed the case, is sent to Siberia, they redeem themselves by designing a Matte Finish slip- cover for this otherwise excellent TV
Monster has always had the reputation to being the best in quality for their products... When you think of wires, you cannot help think of Monster Cable... I used this cable to connect my carputer to my factory head unit... Ran up the middle of the car, grouped with a VGA cable and multiple USB cables, there is no feedback at all.. i was worried the VGA feed may leak into this cable but monster did not let me down.. I highly recommend this product... but as others on here have stated.. little pricey... in the end 'you get what you pay for!
I've had a GE and a Sony (CD543RM) kitchen under counter units.  I've also tested a few others in stores.  The Sony 543 model is superior to any other unit out their and the Sony 553 is superior to the Sony 543.  The 553 is worth the extra bucks for the better sound quality and AM/FM reception. 
I originally bought my daughter an iLive IBCD3816DT boombox for her birthday. The hiss was unbearable, so I took it back and purchased this product. Much better quality control and it docks perfectly with her 2GB ipod nano using the supplied insert. Very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone. It sounds great, looks good, and the controls are very intuitive.
This is perfect (so far) and exactly what I needed.  I have been looking for a new keyboard to work with my desktop, which sits right next to mu Polycom Conference Phone.  I have been looking for something that was silent and took up less desktop space.  I work out of a home office when I am not on the road so I need something that works.  I spend a lot of time on the phone, so I want to be able to type without everyone on the call knowing it.  Perfect.  Setup took about 15 minutes with absolutely no hitches and no issues - the first time that has happened for me with a LogiTech prouct.  I had read these reviews and was prepared for a grueling install, but instead it happened so quickly I was right back to work fully functional.I use my HP Media Center as the base PC for my office and printers - the workhouse of my office, but I have a ThinkPad X60 Tablet in a docking station.  I connect from the Media Center to the ThinkPad using remote computing and it works like a champ new keyboard, mouse, keypad and all.This is a great keyboard, mouse, and numeric keypad combination.  We will see how long the batteries last, but so far so good. A+
I made the mistake to buy the Kensington laser pointer before this one. The Kensington is a good one, very well made, but it is slightly more expensive and lacks the mouse control. I to not know any cheaper model with mouse function. I can maybe prefer a bit the ergonomy of the Kensington, together with the very practical possibility to store the USB receiver inside the unit, but this is probably just my taste and the hiro is quite comfortable either and lighter. My kensington has the embarrassing feature that the laser pointer is interpreted as RETURN on some applications (Exporer on Windows and Opera on Mac OS, for instance). I do not know it that is a bug or if there is some reason for that. However the Hiro does not have this behaviour and that is another reason for which I prefer it.The wheel system of the Hiro presenter is very practical. Compared with my Kensington I found no difference in the quality of the laser: both do their job perfectly. The mouse control is simple and practlical and it will take a very short time to be confident with it. My unit worked perfectly wothout extra software on both Mac an PC. Overall I am extremely satisfied. On the minus side, the labels on the button on the side are printed with very poor colours. the "fn" label diapperared immediately after a few days of usage. A bit disappointing, but, after all, nothing really important. The unit also lacks programmable buttons, but I do not know any presenter with this feature. Bottomline. This presenter works well, it is not expensive, and the mouse control is a true must
All of the PC to Stereo cbales I could find in the stores were only 6ft long.  Due to the furniture arrangement in my living room, I needed a longer cable to make the connection.  I was also worried about loss of sound quality over long distances.  The 20 ft Monster Cable took care of both those issues for me. The connections are solid and the sound quality is great.  It was well worth the money
I bought this mouse about three months ago, and I love it.  It works on every surface, and the scroller works well too.  The only complaint I have is that the cord is rather short (about 2.5 feet long), and it plugs into the left-hand side of my laptop, which means that I only have about a foot to work with.  Although, I think that complaint can be shared equally with the Dell people for putting the USB port on the left (good deal for the left-handed population, I guess).  Some people have complained about the wind-up function for the cord getting tangled, but I haven't had any problems with that
These phones are great.  Sound quality is very good, including the speaker phone option.  Phones have many handy features, and all features are intuitive to use.  No problem with the range.  Very easy to set up.  Battery life has proven to be no concern so far.  The phones feel comfortable in the hand.  I couldn't be happier
This is the best photo printer I have seen.  I work at a print shop and it tops the very expensive printers that I use.  I am also a photograher and image and color quality is very important to me.  I get excellent results with this printer.
Very pleased with the high capacity cartridge with my Epson Stylus CX6600.  "Compatibles" do not compare
Nothing much to comment about on an ink cartridge...it works as it should.  If they could only reduce the cost of these things then I would be impressed
As homeschoolers, we were in search for a laminator that could help us preserve the various documents we woul be using year in and year out.  The QuikFinish PLH4100 10" Laminator has done an exceptional job.  Easy to use, as my wife had it out of the box and using it within minutes
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT,"TOP OF THE LINE" NEVER GET LOST AGAIN NO MORE SPAT WITH YOUR FRIENDS, OR OTHERS. JUST GET THE MAGELLAN AND YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ONE
like the other guy, not much can be said. works. works well. end of story.  The only thing i would have liked to see was integration of sorts into a pci slot or something, to keep it within the case
Item works perfectly fine.  A little slow on the shipping, so I suggest getting the faster shipping with the purchase of your item.  My experience could not have been better.  Excellent job thank you very much.  Great experience. 
After installing the card, I booted up my Windows XP and it locked up.  After rebooting again, however, the card worked fine and has continued to work fine.I've only had the card for two days, and so far I am very happy with it. Here's my setup: Windows XP Home Edition, Direct TV set-top box, and a standard cable from the set-top box into the card.  Since the set-top box is in the other room, I'm just using the set-top box remote to set it on the right channel.  A little tedious, but it's fine for recording a few shows.  I haven't tried the remote that came with the card (I assume it doesn't work through walls).The WinTV 2000 software is not very user friendly, but I haven't found any bugs in it yet.I chose not to install the software and drivers from the CD.  Instead, I downloaded all of the latest versions directly from the manufacturer's web site
We got this phone about 3 years ago.  In the past month, the buttons have begun to be an issue.  You can press and press a button and maybe on the 3rd try, it works.  Finally go another phone.  As with all things today, it isn't made to last.  However, the price makes it less painful to have to buy another so soon
I use this product with Tiki Navigator navigation s/w to connect my garmin gps 76 map to my laptop.  This product was recommended by Tiki Navigator to use because it was previously reviewed as performing perfectly, which it does.  It installs easily and with the blue led allows you to see if power is still connected.  Highly recommended
I use this with a PC running on Windows XP Home Edition SP2 and it works marvels. Damn, I didn't even need to install the drivers that came with it. I just grabbed the USB cable, plugged it in and started making sequences on Sonar 4.No latency, nothing.I recommend this product for both PC and Mac users
When I first got a wireless network at home I purchased a Kensington WIFI Finder.  It worked fine.  But as time went on I saw these smaller versions come out from Chrysalis Development.  I heard they were more powerful and more versatile.  So I bought one.  I was NOT disappointed.  Since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car, it fit perfectly on my keychain.  Also it has a much longer range than the others.  But best of all, it is directional.  Meaning I can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the LEDs change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases.  What a great product. I Love it! 
This product work perfectly in the Epson printer! The quality of printing is great!
With all the reviews about how easy the Nano scratches, I left the protective film on until I found the right case the next day at CC (they had just received them that day), sorry Amazon but the Nano did come from you.  Anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the Nano itself.  It comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself.  I have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it, but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible, it works great.  It fits snugly in this case, yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update. The case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls. I have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all.  The belt clip is sturdy and secure.  The magnetic snap for closing it works great. The case can be closed with headphones attached, but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access. This case is as cool as the Nano itself and I would very highly recommend it. I hope Belkin makes the same case for the new IPOD
I have been looking for a larger CF card for my Dell Axim x50v. the seagate CF drive does not work. finally, i got this working for this price. I think it's good.
The Wireless Lavalier Microphone System is perfect for informational interviewing and personal media management. It provides a portable option to amplified audient properties and gives the user a greater degree of movement during presentations. It can be used as a binary system, (two separate microphone systems and a small amplifier are needed)to interview your favorite personality, take testimonials or to exchange opinions with local leaders. The Wireless Lavalier makes the idea addition to any media kit
The best sound I've ever heard in a radio. I also own a Cambridge Soundworks 730 and a Bose Wave CD/Radio.Despite the fact that this is a mono radio, its sound is incredible accurate, warm and powerful. The bass is astounding and the highs crystal clear.I agree with a report I've read in CNET that states this is probably the best sounding radio ever made. 
This was my first GPS system of any kind.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  I have a small Mazda Miata so I wanted a small-screen GPS that did not overwhelm my small dashboard and this did not disappoint.  I was afraid that the screen would be too small, but it's perfect.  I don't think a bigger screen would do anything more than take up more space. I live in New York City and before putting it in my car I walked with the GPS unit in my hands.  Perhaps because of the tall buildings and the slow walking speed it took more than 30 minutes for it to initially receive a satellite signal.  I was convinced it was defective.  It's not.  Once I put  it on the dash of my car and began driving it acquired a satellite signal within a few minutes.This unit comes with a 128Mb Micro SDcard onto which you can load a few state maps at one time.  I ordered a 1Gb Micro SDcard along with this GPS (for approx. $11 on Amazon) and loaded ALL of North America at one time. This eliminates the need to re-load maps when traveling anywhere in the country. It's worth the extra effort. This unit can be quickly moved from one car to another, especially a rental car anywhere in North America.  My very first test of this thing was on the very complicated underpasses and overpasses in northern Manhattan and the Bronx.  It was flawless!  It's impossible to get lost with this thing.  Occasionally I've made a turn too early or too late and within seconds it will re-calculate the best route.  The combination of the voice prompts, the highlighted route you need to go, and the current and next street(s) at the top are excellent. Also, the estimated arrival time in the lower left is nice, but does not account for traffic jams.  The arrival time will just keep getting pushed back the slower you travel.  It's kind of a "best traffic scenario" prediction.This is so easy to use I'm thinking of buying one for my 68-year-old mother who doesn't have a clue when it comes to technology, but I'm convinced she could use this without a problem (once I've loaded the maps for her.)If not having bluetooth and all the other latest bells and whistles on a GPS system doesn't bother you (as it doesn't bother me) buy this, you won't be sorry!
need to info customer that Optical sound cable is required for sound from PS2 console
If your a serious gamer and want the best quality money can buy, like me, I would highly suggest this product. Sounds are crystal clear, and fiber optics is the next step up in technology. My first question for you would be, "how much do you invest in your gaming?". Once again, if your like me the answer is a lot. My next question would be "how important is your audio experience?" YOu dont know what your missing out on until you actually experience the difference. Very happy with this product
I was very pleased with the improvement of picture quality (colour and clarity) over the standard playstation cable. Anyone with an S-Video input should consider making this simple upgrade
Product performs per specifications and is easy to use.  Would like to see fuse easier to replace
My high school is making us buy these calculators, and I want to say it is definately worth the price!  This thing works wonders, and it will do ANYTHING Math-realated that you want to do!!!!!!  I would strongly encourage you to buy this calculator.  It also comes with a great unit converter and the periodic table, so it's great for students like myself to use.  BUY THIS CALCULATOR!!!!!  You can also hook it up to your computer through a USB cable, so you can view your screen that is on the calculator, on your computer monitor, and you can back up and restore your RAM memory
Received exactly what I ordered at a fair price
My wife's grandmother (the person this was bought for) LOVES this phone..."it's easy to use with large buttons  friendly "controls".  I loved the price  ease of setup...  Answering machine is flawless  the handset gets great reception.  Perfect all around:
Great item.  Picture great, sound great, connection choices great.One problem:  Being located about a foot away from an under-cabinet radio, the presence (shut off) of this TV produces an annoying ratteling sound in the radio.  To eliminate this sound you must unplug this TV from the power source! Or, optionally, move it at least three feet away, which in our case is not practical.Very curious!
The EyeTV 2.x software is a bit rough around the edges (compared to Dish DVR and Tivo), but it's very usable and works great.  I bought this so I can watch the Maryland Terrapins at work (CBS MMOD blacks out local games) and it's great to be able to infinitely adjust the video window.  You can record the program and watch it at lunch or when you get a chance.  You will need a good antenna and I wish they provided one like Miglia.  But guess what, you can buy the Miglia magnetic antenna and it works better than many larger antennas from Radio Shack or Target.  The Miglia antenna comes apart and can go with you on travel.  Imagine watching local HDTV on the road without having to use the hotel cable.[...]Product Description:  Portable ATSC antenna for TVMini HD. This antenna is not suitable for analog products such as TVMicro and TVMax.It works with the Hybrid very nicely and only costs $15 US.  It took 4 weeks to arrive, but it's worth it and works much better than the two arial with loop antenna I got for 2x as much
Radio Shack wanted $39.95 for a similar item so at $9.95 this was a steal - swr is good and performance is as much as I need for Corvette runs although it hears well and gives a good transmit signal for the small size far beyond what I need.  I did have to put a metal plate on the Vette (discreetly) as it wouldn't stick to the fiberglass.  Good produc
The product shipped immediately, a new Dell AC Adapter from Cable4Less. I am extremely happy with the company and the charger's performance as I needed a second one so I would not have to keep plugging in and out my primary charger. I didn't think I could get such a good deal on a real Dell product
Without a doubt this is the best product of its type, I looked at several others priced significantly higher, and after setting up the AM2 it was clear I had made the best choice
I have a 40" Samsung LCD and wanted an arm that would both extend and also be able to hold 50 lbs or so.  This arm feels solid and does the job; the tv hasn't fallen yet.  One thing to be sure of is to check the size adapter plate you will need to connect the arm to your tv.  My arm came with a 200 x 100, but I needed a 200 x 200 plate and had to order it separately.  I would recommend this arm
I did a bit of internet research for this, and a site devoted to luggage was RAVING about this. What can I say? They were right, and it is just an unbelievable value. I love it. I got it because I do alot of walking for my commute, had started a class that required me to do alot more to get there and the book was massive. My back was already complaining about what I was carrying around on a daily basis. I ordered it and it arrived in 2 days, My back was and is so grateful.It is tough! the sidewalks aren't in the best shape, and I'm always pulling it up and down over curbs and had a couple of days of ice and snow, and the wheels are scuffed up but still no worse for wear (although the little pad on the bottom for cushioning your hip if you wear it over your shoulder fell off, but why would I want to carry it like that anyway). Very well designed, with plenty of compartments, and padded computer sleeve is removeable. It maneuvers well, is light with a comfortable handle and strap (gel-like). I can grab it by the handle and walk up the metro stairs with no problem.A quality case for a great price
I bought this bag as a replacement for another roller bag for my 17" laptop and was surprised at how compact the design is and how weight conscious it is.  The storage capacity and location for such things as chargers and cords in the space where the roller frame is makes this thinner than my previous bag.  I also appreciate the smaller zippered pocket on top for things like plane tickets and things that you need quick access to.  As an engineer, I must say the design is well worth the price and certainly is a practical way to carry a larger laptop
I needed something to hold my iPod while I skateboard, and this works like a charm. Never moves an inch. Can get a litle uncomfortable if sweating a lot
I use this when working around the house, in the yard and at the gym.  Stays in place very well and gives easy access to the control wheel of my IPOD.  Has stood up to more than a year of heavy use and is still doing well for me
My mother-in-law had one of these that she uses to clean her sewing machine.I rebuild computers and thought how handy this would be and how much money I would save on air cans that are $5 ea. and I have bought a million of. I love this little vacuum attachment set, it works great and has a multitude of uses and has already saved me a bundle...Thanx Cyber-Guys!!!! YOU ROCK!!
I use Print Works CD/DVD envelopes and was worried when I ordered this product that the envelopes wouldn't fit top-up which is important for me because I label the tops of my envelops to make looking through them easier. The envelopes are just a hair over 5" wide and they fit into these storage boxes perfectly. There is just enough room on either side to make flipping through the dvds easy. I ordered four of these and am glad I did. I keep them on a shelf side-by-seide and the make a perfect card-catalog-type filing systemfor all my dvds. I will most definately be ordering up more of these when I need more room; these boxes are great. If you use a 5" wide envelope, rest assured that these boxes are just the right size to fit all your dvds.
Ordered 2 items...Ideastream CD Storage Boxes and Fellows CD Sleeves. which is obviously 2 different manufacturers. When ordering, I clicked on a combination option to order both. Needed 10 of each...the "10" only tranferred to 1 item, not both.  Was not noticed until transaction completed and received a verification.  Called customer service and found out there were two "customer Services" to deal with.  Could not change the order even though it was less than 5 minutes when I first called.   Customer Service is obviouly not in the US...had a communication problem and could not get a "supervisor" as no one was available for 2 hours.   ended up paying for 2 freight charges because we had to place a 2nd order to get the quantity needed.   Could not get any help...will look elsewhere before we place another order of that type.Items were exactly what was needed.    Amazon Customer Service was non-existant
This product is a must have for your Shure earphones.  Once you use this with the earphones you will not want to use the headphones without, it just takes a little getting used to
I agree with the prior review of these JBL E10s, however I'd go to the E20s for a small room main stereo set--better bass worth the slight price increase.  Bought for rear channel (RC) use, I find the E10s quite "airy", with what seems like a better high frequency response than the main E30s I just bought from A'.com (see my 5 Star review), giving extremely open and detailed "surround" RC performance.  NOTE: The specs listed on A'.com for the E10s state "Bi-wireable: Yes" BUT...unless JBL has just changed the terminals to do this that's wrong--mine have just a single terminal set, and DON'T BOTHER with the pricey speaker mounts offered as accessories (unless you plan ceiling installs) as they come with two "slide down" screw slots attached to the back for wall installation.  Surfing for the BEST PRICE, I bought mine refurbished from [...] for a LOW $53.00 bid plus $18.00 S+H directly from JBL and you may find the E30s/E20s from JBL as refurbs there as well.As RC speakers--ESPECIALLY at the price I got them--I recommend them highly, well deserving the 5 Star rating given
I had a 1st generation shuffle and upgraded to a 60gb video which I adore! However, I found that whenever I went running I was stealing my old shuffle back from my daughter.  I bought this shuffle for my husband and fell in instant love with it.  I really like how portable it is and you can't beat being able to just clip it onto your clothing.  No arm straps, no more lanyards.  So now I have the 60 gig for my entire library of music and videos and the shuffle for exercise
The mouse itself is very nicely designed and cool looking. I use it with my Apple Mac G5. The optical tracking is great, no moving parts. The scroll wheel is indispensable for browsing the web and scrolling through documents. I just wish the software that comes with it would be more stable, less buggy. I had to uninstall it and use another mouse driver with more options, functions and less bugs
My mom bought me the candlestick phone and it is great. My friends love it, too. It looks really cool and the ringtone it just like my grandmas old phone. I can hear everybody really clear and they have no problem hearing me. I am very happy with this phone
I got mine for about 1 week ago to match with my MBP (silver theme). Someone mentioned about the light indications not showing as they should, or in the wrong way but mine works fine.CONS:- light indicator shows exactly which USB ports are in use. - Small in size- Has USB port on top which comes in handy.- Enough USB power- so far I didn't have to plug in the power charger yet. - Comes with a USB plugged light. - Comes with a extended USB cable (for you to connect the hub to your computer)- the USB plug is silver + transparent in color which looks kinda nice.PRONS:- it camed with some minor scratches on the hub's surface although I just took it out from its sealed package carefully. Those surface scratches aren't too noticeable. (Didn't want to return it and waste time  money). - as many have already mentioned, the USB cable is connected to the hub permanently. Other thoughts:- The USB cable connected the the hub is pretty thin. It'd be a good feature (look less noticeable) f you treat the cable nicely, but if you are harsh on the cable, it feels like it may break. Will be GREAT if this hub has firewire ports, but I'm very happy with this item
I've owned this pocket pc for a week now with very little problems.  I don't know anything about an upgrade but so far I haven't had any major problems with it.  When I left it in the car and then came home it wouldn't turn on.  I noticed it was very warm but as soon as I did a soft reset the device turned on.  The soft reset doesn't make you lose all your data.  I just had to reset the date.  I've had to do this a couple of times so far.   I did purchase a 2 gig sd card and have lots of room.  I recommend that you shop around for the 2 gig memory card however because I bought mine from amazon and then I found it cheaper at best buy.I am really happy with this product. I love the way it looks.  It's easy to figure out and I'm not really savvy with electronic gadgets.  I did sign up for hotmail so I could use the msn features.  It was easy to sync my music to the device and the download is done automatically with the sync.  The music sounds great with a great pair of headphones. I use the calendar which helps to remind of events and appointments.  Also use the task button which reminds of stuff that needs to be done.  Great for the highly stressed out who tend to forget things. There is also a feature to write a note in your own handwriting and then the device turns it into typewritten words.  Really neat!I use the recording device to record my class lecture and it's a little hard to hear but there is a lot of noise in the classroom and I sit in the back and the teacher is up at the front.  But the important thing is that I could understand what was being said so i could transcribe it.  As a nursing student I was able to purchase and download nursing programs from a website with no problems and they run great.I just can't believe all the features that come with this pocket pc.  I have no regrets making this purchase.  I look forward to reading more reviews on this product and learning everything it can do.  So far it's been fun
An outstanding platform for Windows mobile operating system.  Flawless syncing with home/office desktop.  Clear, high resolution screen is a joy compared to my previous Palm based PDA's.  Wireless functioning is reliable and seamless.  Ergonomics are excellent.  Good to above average batery life with power saver options.  Would highly recommend this product
When it comes to ink for my R1800 photo printer, I am concerned with the quality of the images I print. The Epson matte black UltraChrome Hi-Gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudging. It is important to me that my prints are of high quality, so I don't attempt to use the cheaper compatible ink cartridges. The color can be duplicated, but all inks are not created equal.  Third party options may produce a good print initially, but may not hold up or last as long.PROS:Provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudgingCONS:Pric
This is the correct ink for my printer.  I do not buy lower priced substitutes.  It was great to find this on Amazon at a good price and eligible for free shipping.  I only wish Amazon stocked the complete set of inks for this printer which I purchased from them. 
It's a good phone, works well. I like the Caller ID  Function buttons being a different color than from the rest of the phone, makes them easier to see  use. It has good sound  a ring tone that doesn't jangle the nerves.The only problem I had with it is that the cord goes directly into the phone  one must use the cord that the phone comes with, rather than one already in use. I purchased an adapter so that I could plug it into an extension phone cord because we needed to put it some distance from the wall jack. Not a big deal in my book but one I didn't learn about until I got the phone.Overall I am pleased with it
While these recorders are considered "old fashioned" by electronic geeks, they are very useful for those of us who just want to use the counters and go to specific areas of a tape.  Mine paid for itself in the first 5 minutes of a legal deposition when I jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape.  He still insisted he couldn't remember anything, but had to admit it was his voice and that he -- being the model of honesty and truth -- must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke.  Very effective, these "old-fashioned" recorders. 
After 8 months of thinking, "these (foam inserts that came with my E3c's)will last forever" I broke down and ordered these replacements as the originals were getting quite dirty.   Whoa!  The new ones made me realize how much my originals had hardened.  My great sound and comfort was back - and the decay was so gradual I didn't even realize what I was missing!So, 5 stars for performance, but 3 stars for what amounts to some pretty expensive foam ear plugs.  Avg=4stars
I needed to have an s-video feed from my classroom computer to a projector and to a TV/Monitor.   This proved to be the most cost-effective solution to the problem.  It works just as hoped
This cable was just what I needed to connect my stereo to my computer's sound card across the room.  I've been converting old LPs to digital files, and having a well-built cable probably improved the sound quality considerably.  Amazon's price was unbeatable too
Opened the enclosure, plugged in my hard drive, connected it to my PC, and it worked. Simple as that.I spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that I had to remove a single screw from the back panel when I really had to remove two screws, but that was the only (very minor) problem.There is no fan in the case, which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself. I am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink, but I havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself.I am pleased with the enclosure, and would happily recomend it to anyone
We bought this to use with our WS-300M to record a class. We thought the stereo would result in a better quality recording. In the end, we set the recorder to MONO (HQ) because the speaker moves his head and the sound travels from one channel to the other! Good quality but distracting. Save your money and buy the mono mic. The quality is excellent in either setting.Buy the way, in case you miss it, this mic does come with a cable to connect it to the recorder
I purchased this GPS back in April of 2006 and have been very happy with it since.  It is not perfect, but you have to remember that this is not a dedicated street navigator or hicker GPS, it's a hybrid of the two and with that there are compromises.In the car:  It is accurate and maps routes quickly 90% of the time.  The other 10% of the time it either looses signal, has outdated maps (my update is ordered and on it's way as I type), or just slow processing for some reason.  Of this 10% of the time I'd say only 2% of the time has this been an actual problem for me.  The rest of the time I was able to simply guess what I needed to do next or it didn't matter at all.  I have not found a perfect way of fixing the slow route calcuations, but the vast majority of the time this hasn't been an issue.On foot:  One of the features that sold me on this was the fact that it had a long lasting battery and it was waterproof.  Both qualities needed to be used for hiking.  The only catch is you have to turn off the lock to roads, otherwise you will get some really confusing directions!  Also it is difficult to program in destinations by coordinates as opposed to addresses, but it can be done (put in and address then change everything including the coordinates in the confirmation screen before hitting route!).On Boat:  Haven't tested this as I don't have a boat, and haven't purchased the water based maps.Overall I'm very happy with this and looking forward to the map update.  I wish it was a little faster on route calculating and map drawing, and that it was easier to imput exact coordinate points.  It's still better than buying/lugging around 2 seperate GPS systems to me
I received my package within three days via the Super Saver Shipping (cost me nothing). The printer is great, too. I used the Brother 1440 series before and now upgraded to HP and I'm impressed. The printer shoots out the first page immediately without having to warm up, and its very light weight and small size making it more portable. I love it
Bought this Mp3 player for my girlfriend for christmas. She loves it. It is small and easy to use. The headphones could be better though. The process of puting songs onto the player is simple and fast. Considering you cannot hear the music without headphones...and the headphones that come with it are not very good, it only gets a 4 out of 5
I recently bought one of these babies for my niece seeing that she loves music but I was unwilling to pay an arm and a leg. It was a reasonable price and offers just what it delivers. She seems to really enjoy and found it to be easy to load both music and documents. The only real problem that I had with is that it costed less a few days after I purchased it. But that's really a personal problem
I own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds. I have to say that the only way to improve upon this product, other than offering more color combinations, would be to make it bulletproof, which it damn near is already. A wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory. Although $15 might come across as steep for such a small product, the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds. The $100+ Shure earphones are a sizable investment and must be protected. The Sendstation Earbuddy meets that demand better than any other product in it's category
The card works great in my camera.  No problems.  I would recommend the product
This card was easy to install and works well. I have very little experience even opening a compter box. Making a spot for the connection to come out of the computer case turned out to be the most difficult part.
Awesome video card.. Im using this with Dvi cable on my 22 inch Viewsonic lcd. I must say it installed great and looks awesome!! Great card for the money def a happy customer!! :
I've had two RM-EZ2 for over a year now (on different TVs) ... very satisfactory indeed.pro:-very smooth action, easy to press buttons, fine for big clumsy fingers and poor eyesight-always works without fussy pointing-good battery lifecon:-eventually one will accidentally depress the wrong CBL or TV button and wonder why the remote no longer works ...the cure is simple, just depress the correct button, but if you forget that they are there, you might think the remote is broken - it's not, it's you.-There seems to be no way to generate the code to put your TV into setup mode - so don't throw away the manufacturer's original remote if you ever want to put the TV into setup mode
  Great portability, Good picture for the price. I like the fact that I can plug this player into any TV and play DVD's and also take it in the car, camping or anywhere. I also purchased a small set of external speakers which will really improve the sound. Onboard speakers a little lacking but overall a great value
This photo paper is truly top of the line, profession grade paper. I have been using it for a few years in making very large photo prints - and they always turn out great.
This is extremely high quality photo paper best used in Canon photo printers.  The 13" by 19" is used best with the Canon I9000 printer series, with a web of 13".  This paper resists moisture damage and has archival quality. 
I have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts.  All in all pretty pleased with the purchase.  It was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my iPod Mini.  There are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models.  Panicked at first because they didn't have one for the Mini, but it was already installed on the model.  Cons:- Light dimmer has three settings, but even the lowest is too bright.  You can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote.- No ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week.  For example 7:00AM Monday to Friday, no alarm on Weekends.- Wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset (by you) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle.- Sound is great for an alarm clock.  Don't think it will compare with a mini stereo or Bose SoundDock.  Would buy again at the price
 The first ipod clock radio I bought was an Emerson iTone that was very disappointing. After returning it, I did a bunch of research, and decided to order the i177 (white). I am very happy with the unit. The sound is great. While it is not a Bose, it sounds way better than your average alarm clock. The controls are very intuitive and simple to use. I have a 4th generation ipod, and it fit perfectly. Another great feature is the display dimmer. You can turn the backlight completely off, a feature not found in many other products. A common complaint I read about for other brands of radio was that the display would light up the room! Not a problem with this unit. the remote control is pretty neat too. I like the fact that I can control my ipod remotely. There are 2 separate alarms, which is nice if your significant other has to get up at a different time. The only lacking feature is the ability to store radio stations. This would be nice, but I bought this unit to wake to my ipod so I can't complain. Overall this thing is great.
This is my first plasma TV and I love it.  We bought this to put the icing on the cake after having remodeled our complete house.  The TV sounds great, and looks great.  HDTV is stunning!  I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this TV to anyone
This phone installed easily, has good sound, caller ID is visible. hooks securely. That's about all we wanted
Since there is now relatively few choices for a good corded phone (esp. with caller ID), this phone is tops. This phone and all other AT phones corded or cordless, exhibit slight feedback when talking loud or when hanging up.  But no other phone out there seems to be nearly as durable.  Given the other choices, this is the one to get
I bought this device to mount on the wall in front of my work desk, and for that purpose it's an admirable phone.Plus: The contrast- adjustable LCD displays current date and time without you having to set it, the buttons for call list browsing, option setting, etc. are on the back of the receiver so you don't have to take the phone off the hook to use them. The sound quality is great of course, this being a corded phone, and it feels somewhat worthy in your hand. The keypad lights up, although only for a few seconds - dial fast in the dark! The ring tone is nice at its medium setting.Minus: I find the base a bit bulky, the LCD has no background light, and when the handset is set to "hi" volume, you do hear a bit of a screeching noise when putting the set down on the base (I keep the setting at "lo" though, which is plenty loud). My main gripe is that the phone doesn't have a voicemail indicator, which would be extremely sweet with my phone company (Vonage). Also, the caller id stuff works with batteries ONLY - at least, they could have put a 6v ac adapter plug on the phone.Still, four stars because the phone does all it says it does
I checked previous reviews before purchasing this notebook case. What I received is what I expected. Lots of compartments to store needed accessories, sturdy construction, pleasant appearance. As with a previous review, my only citicism is the shoulder strap. While it is comfortable when used, it is also fixed and cannot be removed. I've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane. Other than that, it was a good purchase for the price
This monitor is an awesome buy.  I had no problems with my monitor, dead pixel-wise.The only complaints I have to add are those that others have already voiced.  The stand does not securely fasten to the monitor, it just sort of sits there... a good push and down she may go.  The menu buttons on the right side aren't confusing to use, my other monitors have used a similar setup: Menu activates menu and also activates a menu item, up/down change values, menu backs out and there is a menu item to exit.  If I had put two of these monitors side by side, I can see how accessing the power button of the monitor on the left would be an issue, minor but perhaps irksome.I have not tested the speakers, but seriously a good set of speakers won't set you back much, that's not what this monitor is for.  I would definitely buy another one in a heartbeat, if I didn't already have three monitors to begin with
If only other computer products were this easy to set up and use - highly recommend this product
Makes plane flights so much more enjoyable and costs hundreds less than other brands.  Only  thing that could make it better is passive noise reduction but then it would be bulkier
Price is excellent.  No problems but I falls below a 5 star due to product lacking higher quality materials. 
They don't collapse, so they aren't the most easily portable as you sure aren't putting them in your pocket.  You also aren't listening to music in bed with them, as mentioned in other reviews, the back is not adjustable and will push the vertical facing speakers out of your ears.I tend to collect lower end headphones, and why not.  So, I do have a unique perspective on them (or so I say, mostly to flatter myself).These, compared to other vertical designs, are good.  The sound is better than most.  Not quite as good as the Sony h.EAR line, but those would never stay in my ears and when dangling they are literally tangle hooks.  These p9's are simple, one piece, and very smartly the cord only comes up to one ear.The volume adjustment makes them nice for Tv and computer use.  Also, if you ever listen while using a splitter, make sure the other person is wearing the cans (or whatever more power consumptiony headphones) so you can cut your volume.  My wife wears cans when watching TV, so when I just MUST watch some witty Sonic commercial, I just plug myself in.They aren't perfect.  I'd like to also try the Sennheiser vertical over the head cheapos as well as the Sony folding ones.  They did come in very handy when my scroll wheel on my Rio Carbon was broken (only volume control on the thing).  For reference, my everyday buds are Sony ED21LPs, which I highly reccomend for all purpose use as they wont fall out, and can be stored in a very small area.  Heck, I even use the stupid pouch that comes with them.But, yeah, knowing the weaknesses of the p9, if you think you'd like it, then you'll love it
I have went through so many Cd-R blanks and finally found some with some good dye and have zero error burning rate.  TDK is amazing. The first one i've burned i've now had for over a year and still no defects on the back of it.  It's amazing
I purchased this microphone for my 6 year old daughter to replace a microphone to her karaoke machine that the dog chewed up.  This mic was inexpensive and works fine so far.  We haven't had it very long so it has not really been put to the test of time
These DVDs never fail...I've tried other brands and had miserable results.Stick with Memorex and you won't be sorry
Its great, i bought it for my husband and he loves it.The Zen micro fit perfect
This is a very good sounding sub for the price.  I compared others at higher prices and liked how this produced a full range to compliment the other speakers.  It fills a 1500 sq ft room with cathedral ceiling very well.  I would buy another
I have three handsets and have programmed different ring sounds for each one,e.g., then one in my home office rings with the Three Stooges singing, "Hello, hello, hello!"Phone works very well
This mount is perfect!  It sticks well to the windshield,keeps the GPS rock steady. It allows you to swing to Driver, Center and Passenger's views and back without any bending or remounting.I am very pleased!  My roadmate looks a 100% better on this mount. I hated the mount that came with the GPS.The build quality of this mount also seems to be very good.I would highly recomend this mount
In spite of some of the poor reviews for this product, it met all of my expectations 100%. Thanks to the reviews, I understood that the unit doesn't have a builtin antenna or batteries, which was helpful to know in advance. But of course the specifications never claimed those features in the first place.I was looking for a small TV to fit in the corner of my bathroom, and this unit is perfect for that. As a bonus, I can not only watch the news while I'm getting ready for work in the morning, but I can listen to MP3 rips when I'm in the shower. I've owned the unit for several weeks now, use it every day, and have never had a problem playing any disk, either copy-protected movies or CDs. My only concern so far has been that I didn't receive a warrantee card with the unit.I especially like the portability. It's so easy to pick up and take anywhere, such as watching a movie in bed, and even outside (if it's not too bright out) for watching sports on the patio. The speakers are adequate, considering their size, and the headphone jack lets me either use headphones or external amplified speakers if I want better quality.In summary, I have to repeat that my expectations were set before I bought the unit and I am very pleased with what I got for the price
I wish I searched, found,  purchased one earlier. I'm a road warrior with laptop. I work from home at times  have a desktop. This device is awesome to plug in  go. I love it. Better than a clunky port replicator for my laptop  saves precious desk space. I'd highly recommend
At around $35. these UltraEars are a amazing deal. They have great base, mids, and highs. The seperation is good too. If you tweek your mp3's sound you can realy dial them in. Push them nice and tight in to your ear to get the best sound.   
This is an absolutely wonderful product.  The CD Player in my Cadillac was skipping tracks and was a mess.  One use of this cleaner (specially for cars) and my player was good as new
I bought the cooler for my Dell Inspiron which tends to get hot because I work it so hard - it's cut down the time the internal fan kicks in drastically, is very sturdy yet light enough for me.So I bought another (wide-screen)(black) version for my HP Pavilion which has more RAM and so doesn't have to work that hard, now its internal fan virtually never kicks in.  In both cases the fan is so quiet that I have to turn it on/off to make sure that it is working.The only improvement I would suggest is more usb ports.4 stars because 5 is perfection
My daughter is very happy with the product. She not only got the MP3 player she wanted, she also got her favorite color "PINK". Thought we got a great deal and it has been working wonderfully. Infact, my son is now jealous that his younger sister has a better MP3 player than he has
the samsung I bought shows a great quality pictue. i love it
It's a great tool to have at all times.  Security, provacy, and power in one little handy device.  And the U3 apps are multiplying quickly.  Next I want a full-blown system on a flash drive
This is an amazing little device. I carry every Word and Excel file I have created in the last year on this device. How remarkable is that? Kingston really had a better profile than other thumb drives. I still have my clip cap after several months. I carry it with me daily. The really powerful potential for these devices is yet to be realised but I'm thinking about them! Let me know how you are using yours.In addition to my data files, I downloaded applications giving my flash drive the power to accomplish tasks on its own. Overall, I am happy with my drive and believe as you think of new ways to employ one you will be too. I give this device a big thumb's up
I bought the keyboard for my 5-year-old son.  The keyboard is light weight and therefore easy to carry.  Small and convenient for my son to play anywhere.  I am using batteries and really enjoy the freedom of movement, i.e. not needing to worry about plugging it into a power source. It's an excellent choice for my situation
I purchased the Casio keyboard for my Grand-daughter's 4th birthday.  She really enjoyed playing it.  As a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day.  It is the perfect size for a small child.  She sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms.  The only thing that wasn't perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing, but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it
I enjoy this mouse. Usually, I don't like using the touch pad on laptops but after deciding to buy a mouse, I had to look for a specific mouse that would fit into my lifestyle as a student. I have small hands and I hate carrying out heavy objects in my bookbag. Since I have to lug my laptop around, I needed a mouse that didn't take a lot of space, is good enough to withstand constant shifting in my laptop, and that worked well with my needs.Pros: Small size, optical, scrolling tab, and portabilityCons: Sometimes the mouse jumps around a bit on its own. BUT this happens only a few times every few weeks - so it's not often enough to cause a problem for me.Enjoy
I just bought my first laptop computer and really, really hated the touchpad. I found it unresponsive at times and found the whole right clicking and using the pad at the same time a pain.I spent a while browsing the different mice available on this and other sites and in the end decided upon this little number.I am very happy that I did too. Its pretty small and very lightweight but at the same time it doesnt feel at all fragile - definately well made. Im about 5'11 and have fairly big hands - I find this mouse comfortable to use. It looks pretty cool too, the red panels on the side light up, which is always good for night work. All the buttons are very responsive and that middle button is a godsend after using the touchpad for the past month. I couldnt ask for better all round performance. And for $20 you really cant go wrong, it really is a great price for a microsoft mouse. The only reason I dont give it five stars?? Well this is technology - although it is a awesome piece of kit, there are always other things or features they could have added
This router has worked great for the past year.  We have 3 Linux computers connected to DSL through it.One PC is at the far end of the house.  We use two Novatech Powerline Ethernet Adapters to connect that PC to the Netgear router through our home powerline wiring.  Netgear and Novatech work fine together, with no DSL speed degredation.The browser interface is easy to use.  The firewall features are easy enough for the inexpert user to understand.The manual is good, but I would prefer to have a hard copy
This PNY 2.0GB card has proven to be plenty as a digital camera card.  We purchased the 2 gig card for my wife's Canon Powershot S-900 "Elph" to replace smaller memory cards.  Although 1GB cards worked adequately with the "Elph" we noticed, early on, that its 10.0 mega pixels quickly filled up the photo card.  The 2.0GB holds many more photos (over 400 shots and counting) than the 1GB.  At half the price of other brands, the PNY is proving to be very satisfactory (we purchased two 2.0s at once).We happily recommend the PNY 2.0GB photo card for your photos.  It makes a great gift candidate.  Get yours soon!
What I ordered - on time delivery - good price
These batteries last a long time. Cheaper batteries won't hold a charge after repeated use/charging. I have AA Energizer batteries and after a year they still hold a charge with out any problems.
Don't let the size fool you - I don't know much about audio - yet - but I can tell you the sound recorded from this mic is WAYYYY better than the USB Microphone Headset I was using. Much crisper with out all the fuzziness. And I didn't spend nearly as much as the Online Gurus were recommending. I am sure the $600 mic is great - but this is doing every thing I need.
This lavalier microphone works great and is very easy to figure out.  Well worth while if you're trying to record an individual talking onto a camcorder
Can't say enough good things about this Brother all-in-one, given its price and features.  (I paid $100 more than the new Amazon price elsewhere a week ago.)I installed as a network device and set up the software on my XP Pro as well as Mac OS 10.4.9 machines ... easy installation, and the interface on each OS is essentially the same.  Super fast prints from either machine, crisp and beautiful, with tonal background fills printing which never showed up on my previous HP laser.Duplex scan/fax as well as duplex print was the key to my purchase, and I've been really happy.  What I did not anticipate was just how fast the printer is, or how rich the delivered software is compared with prior HP experience.Noises don't seem unusual to me - no crackling here, just noisy paper handling by ADF and print engine.  No big deal IMHO.Only a few minor negatives I've seen so far:  (1) it looks like the firmware can only be updated from a Windows computer, so Mac folks are stuck there (mine was delivered with current version of firmware, so maybe this doesn't matter), (2) you cannot feed heavy stock through it, even the manual feed tray - so need to keep a straight feed device around if you need thicker than 24# stock, (3) scanner transfer rate to computer is a bit slow - not sure if it is the network interface or a slow processor in the device, and (4) expansion memory is not a popular size, so is more expensive than current PC memory - not sure if I'll upgrade or not.Haven't tried envelopes yet, so can't respond to earlier comments from others.It's kind of entertaining to watch the machine do a duplex copy - as pages in the ADF suck in and out to scan both sides, and pages ejecting come partway out and suck back in to copy the back side
This is an excellent boom box if you want to be able to take your SkyFi out of your car and put it in the house or take it anywhere. It works great
I have had this tv since the weekend before the Superbowl. The Superbowl and any Nascar race looks incredible. Many reviews I read(everyone on here)which had totaled around 109. Whew! I gotta tell ya though, this tv replaced a 51" Sony HDTV. The sound was awesome. When I turned on this new Samsung I was VERY disappointed. My wife almost made me send it back because of it. I made some adjustments which did make it sound a little better but nowhere near the Sony. I went to a big box store and they told me it was because these companies expect that you will hook it up through a surround system and not use the TV sound. {shrug} I do for movies but not for regular tv.Overall it is a very nice tv especially for the $$
Compared to my logitech mouseman dual optical from 2000, this mouse blows it away by far in accuracy, precision.  What I find to be a drawback is the mouse's light weight and small size.  The size comes in handy if I need to flick, but be sure to keep the wire out of the way - as the mouse is so light if you have the wire in a bad spot, it will push the mouse and affect your aim at crucial moments. The "change sensitivity" button is in a strange spot (at least if u have large hands) located in the center of the mouse where you will need to reach far back and almost touch the pad of your palm of the finger you're reaching with - not an efficient movement, therefore not applicable in games (you can assign a sensitivity script to perhaps one of the side mouse buttons if necessary).  These are only minor itches when compared to the outstanding precision and I would highly recommend it
I did my research before purchasing this wireless card from Amazon to use in conjunction with my Belkin Pre-N wireless router.  According to every net review I'd read, this combination of Belkin Pre-N desktop card and router had the best range and throughput at that range than any other card/router in its class, and as my workstation is out in the middle of a farm an almost impossible distance from the router, 'range' is what I needed above all.After some configuration and finding the best spot to put the computer itself, I now regularly have connection qualities in the 77-90% range a good 200-300 ft. from my router which is in another building entirely (and both have a lot of metal cladding and what-not I had expected to cause a great deal of interference if not outright unworkability.)The odd thing about this 'Pre-N' combination from Belkin is that apparently the later Belkin N equipment is grossly inferior, and manages to pull off only about half the range of this model.  These cards and the Pre-N router are becoming harder to find as they've been superseded by the newer (inferior) models currently in the stores, so if you have to operate wireless at great distances, I doubt you'll beat these Belkin models for at least the immediate future
I mean... 10 usbs, sli, 6 SATAs, support for up to 13 GB of RAM and theorethically more. Too much
i already test a loot of mobo... asus, msi (my last was k8n diamond), and others... but this board looks like no other, and realy works!!! for gamers is the ultimate board... i really recomend it!
I recently bought one of these for our 18-month-old son.  The piano arrived in fine shape.  The piano and bench are sturdy and well made when you put them together properly.  The sound is just like I remember a toy piano should sound.  Notes are not perfectly in tune like a fine instrument, but tuned within reason to the notes of the scale, including sharps and flats.   Most importantly, our little boy just loves playing this piano.  Hopefully it will inspire him to continue and so it is as great an introdroduction to music as any other toy, including the electronic toys, we have purchased for him.  I also liked that he wasn't able to pull off the keys try as he may.  They just kind of become locked when he trys to do that and can be put back in place by minor adjstment. 
When we initially pulled this out the box, I was excited becaue it was crafted so well!  Real wood and excellent craftsmanship - HOWEVER - the sound absolutely sucks!  It sounds like Elmo's toy piano, or even worse.  I thought it was just the fact that the piano was sitting flat on the floor (I hadn't installed the legs yet), and the sound was just off.  By the time I got everything assembled, the disappointment settled in even deeper. This piano was not worth the price I paid for it - by any stretch of the imagination.  I realize this is a TOY and not an instrument; but again, for the money, you'd expect a better sounding product.  An added note: my daughter LOVES banging on it
Two-port print servers are the best and this product is great!  The D-Link DP-300U was very easy to set up.  Every house should have a two port print server: one printer for an ink jet printer, one for a laser printer.  Thank you D-Link for not killing this product.  I hope you never do
In my opinion, Sony's strength lies in its TVs.  This line of LCD sets are expensive, but you'll definitely get what you pay for.  The picture quality is incredible!  The beauty of this set is also material - it is a work of art.  While the internal speakers are decent, I would have been just as happy not to have them.  But thanks to the beautiful design of the bezel, you don't even know the speakers are there.Some reviewers have mentioned "LCD clouding", and for a product of this price it would serve you well to do the appropriate Google search.  But Sony stands by its products, and if you receive a set that is not up to standards, they will rectify the situation.  Also, many reviewers are mentioning a lower-quality picture.  It is important to understand what kind of signal you are feeding the TV, and what signal will give you the optimal image.  Not all HD signals are the same, and will provide you with varying degrees of quality.  Be prepared to upgrade other equipment to explore the maximum potential of this device.  But, I have yet to see a signal that wasn't enhanced by being viewed on this set over my previous Panasonic tube set.The interchangable bezels is a nice idea, but only for those with deep(er) pockets.  The silver set alone is beautiful, and if I had only one complaint, it would be that it's harder to get matching Sony peripherals in silver than you might think.  All in all, it's the best LCD you can buy
As the PS2 does not have HDMI outputs for High-Definition TV's, the Monster Cable GameLink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more. You'd have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard (red, white, yellow) AV cables picture clarity. They are in two different worlds and Monster fully delivers. However, your TV must have component (red, blue, green) inputs for this cable to be useful.Ensure that you have a fiber optic digital cable for your sound to go from your PS2 to your compatible tv/receiver. These cables are for picture only and do not have a sound cable. Therefore, you'll have to forget using the single plug-in the PS2 offers for both audio and video. However, your sound will be uncompressed, fully digital audio. This is definitely a plus, rather than a negative. Any mid-priced television or receiver built in the last six years will have a digital audio input
This really works  is very sturdy.  The problem is the bolts they give is too heavy for light home projectors.  Just get 14inch screws from Lowes  you will be OK.The manual is not good
I have been happy with these phones.  I find no problem with the sound - no static at all.  The only small thing I have noticed is that occasionally the sound echoes a little.  I do not understand the terrible reviews - this phone is very usable
I don't understand the 1 star reviews, unless there is some product variability.  Price was $60 at Target.  Talk time is OK, although the longest I have been on the phone is maybe 10 or 15 minutes.  Range is fine.  Phone works all over the house, and audio quality if fine
Buy it and you will not live home without it.  If I would rate this product, I will rated a 6 stars.
These buds are definitely a step up from the standard iPod buds.  They stay in your ears much more easily (without the foam black covers, which are easily lost), the sound is at least marginally better, and the overall construction seems to be better.  You can't do much better for the money.However, if you're willing to spend a little more, the JLab JBuds are the way to go.  I own both the Gumys and the JBuds, and the Gumys are my workout pair, and I use the JBuds for everything else.But if you're looking to spend as little as possible yet still upgrade from the iPod buds, the Gumys are the way to go
Great product.  Totally eliminates the need to constantly change frequencies in urban areas
Great GPS unit that does what is supposed to do and flawlessly at that. Clear easy to read display and instructions. Menus and interface are self-intuitive to the degree that you just turn it on and start using it. No downloads, activations or learning required. Satellite acquisition takes just a few seconds and recalculation when you miss a turn or instruction is equally fast. Accuracy is impressive with spot-on instructions and updated maps. Even small streets in rural areas are recognized and labeled. After looking at the Garmin and Magellan units I thought this was the best unit for the price. It has the largest screen and the most features for this price range. A previous reviewer complained about the misrepresentation of Bluetooth capabilities to which I completely disagree. The fact the Bluetooth features are available at this price range is already impressive. Also unless you buy a much pricier unit none of them come with a dashboard stand. All manufacturers seem to sell them as options (Garmin included).
This is another terrific assortment of Sharpie permanent pens, for a very good price. Try them. I'm never without Sharpies, and this deal is good
This markers from Sharpie are excellent! Cool colors! Great on any type of paper. Recommend it 110%
This is the first DVD recorder I purchased. I used the quick set up guide and I was off to the races. The quality of my recordings are crisp and clear. The nero software is user friendly and makes recording dvds easy. I'm totally satisfied with my purchase plus I'm recieving a [...]rebate to top it off
We bought this external drive after learning that our friends lost all but a couple months worth of photos and/or videos from their first year with adorable triplet daughters. It resulted from the dreaded and inevitable hard-drive crash that everyone fears, but nobody thinks will happen to them. Attempts by two data recovery firms were unsuccessful and now they're left with whatever printed photos they and their family and friends could find.Expecting our first child in less than three weeks, we don't want to find ourselves in the same predicament, especially with years of other irreplaceable photos, financial data and other documents on our laptop. Now we're doing weekly, monthly and annual backups and storing some of those offsite to protect against something even worse than a simple crash of a hard drive. Even if we don't completely stick with this new regimen, it's better than what we used to do -- which, though thankfully uneventful, was absolutely nothing.If that's not enough to make you want to buy this, then the Sony name, quality, reliability and ease of use should be. The drive is small, stylish, easily installed and takes up little space in the vertical position. Although it's a little loud when the drive is working, it reads and writes CD-R media up to 48x, Ultra Speed Plus CD-RW up to 32x, DVD+/-R up to 16x, and High Speed DVD+RW up to 8x. After a lengthy initial full backup using the included Nero BackItUp software (about 8 GB onto 10 old CD-R discs in 2.5-3.0 hours), smaller differential monthly backups and incremental weekly backups to 8x DVD+RW discs take between 10 and 20 minutes each when compressing, copying and verifying everything. Backup copies of our 4 GB wedding DVD onto 8x DVD-R discs took about 15-20 minutes.The Nero software seems very extensive, but I haven't used much of it so far. The interface is pretty intuitive and it's easy to find what you want to do, but some of the more detailed or technical options might be overwhelming for someone who's new to this kind of software or doesn't want to spend a lot of time reading the PDF manual. The only real complaint I have is with the BackItUp program's job scheduler, which only gives you daily, weekly and yearly frequency options (you need to set up monthly backups as weekly jobs and either disable or skip them for several weeks in between months), it takes forever to re-scan files when building a new job on an existing one (setting up subsequent daily, weekly or monthly jobs based on the initial full annual backup), and the data you can change for an existing job is limited (can't rename it or alter the content without creating a whole new job).Overall, great external DVD/CD drive for watching video, listening to music and backing up data. Good software that's intuitive and functional with some room for improvement, but there's no real need for additional software you don't already have. Excellent value -- bought it at Amazon for under $160 with taxes and free shipping, and got a $30 mail-in rebate from Sony. Also bought pack of 25 Ritek 8x DVD+RW discs from TheTechGeek.com for $33 delivered and they threw in a free 10-pack of Velocity 8x DVD-R discs. So, for well under $200 and a little effort, you too can view, hear, copy and/or backup your valuable photos, videos, tunes and other data in no time
The printer is fast and printing is always properly aligned on the paper. Quality of printed text is as good as any decent desktop printer and that is why I bought it in the first place. I am yet to try printing photos. Because this is a mobile printer the manufacturer needs to ensure that the unit will stand up to the hits and accidents caused by regular transporting. It might mean providing a second skin or a padded bag with the uni
I bought this enclosure about 1 year ago.  I put a 200GB hard drive in it and use it as my dedicated iTunes library. It was a super easy setup.  Many complain in the other reviews that it's a tight fit inside, but I didn't find it difficult at all to get the hard drive in.  After connecting the hard drive and closing it  up, I simply connected it via FireWire to my Mac G4 and it worked like a charm! Next month I will have it for 1 year and I would be 100% happy with it if not for one thing... the loud fan noise after about 10 minutes of it being turned on! ARGHH!!  All of a sudden it just starts sounding off with this annoying buzzing sound that gets slightly louder with time.  Every-so-often, the buzzing goes away for about 1 to 2 minutes, but it ALWAYS returns with a vengence!  Otherwise, the enclosure has held up and worked nicely for almost 1 year.  I'm definitly going to get rid of it though once I find an enclosure that is equally aesthetically pleasing and as reliable, but not NEARLY as noisy!!!  It's a shame actually, since I'm in the market to get 2 more enclosures to house my Aperture library and data backup, respectively
I just purchased this item two days ago (Thurs.) Today (Sat.) I removed my 160GB Seagate HHD from my Kingwin enclosure and installed it in this one. Installation was not a problem although the molex connector seems to be a tight fit and is almost touching the fan. Fan noise does not seem to be a problem yet. I used the Firewire connection instead of USB and the drive access is much faster than it was with the USB connection on the other enclosure. The price is a little steep compared to others but I got a generous rebate offer with my purchase. Although the case is plastic (my other one was aluminum and plastic) I won't be moving mine around so that won't be an issue
This cable really cleaned up the display image. I had been running another Monster Cable - the 6 meter version. I needed the length before because of the way my system was configured. I have a review under that cable about how quality does matter.And so does length. At the time I wrote the review I was just ordering the cable and was posting what I had found out in researching digital video signals. Everything in there stands true.I changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the cable - the 1 meter version - because I could now get away with a much shorter cable. I installed it this morning and the difference, while not earth shattering, was definitely visible.I use this cable to connect between the video card on a media PC and my TV (Sony rear-projection LCD). The image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows, text, etc., and the image wasn't as clear as I had hoped. While the image looked good, it didn't look great. That's why I decided to take the plunge and spend an extra $79 bucks.The difference is somethine like going from a regular RF feed to your TV and component video cables. Now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming. It actually brings out detail I couldn't even see before - to the point of deciding to turn on FSAA and filtering so video games have a more realistic look. And that they do.I don't know how other brands compare to the Monster Cables as I haven't tried them. What I do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display. You can get that with high quality cables and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing.One more thing while I'm here. I want to thank Amazon for going the extra mile on customer service. I had a DVD disappear somehow during shipping. UPS said they delivered it but I never received it. I asked Amazon if they filed the report with UPS or I did to file a claim. What I got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way. That is service. Thanks Amazon
Love the wireless connection to my HP all-in-one scanner printer. Works great
I almost didn't purchase this CD player because of all the bad reviews it had been getting, but I decided to go for it! I am glad I did, I am very happy with this Sony Walkman! I use it for walking, listening to meditating CDs, audio books, everything and have not had one single problem with it. I am so glad I did not let the few negative reviews sway my decision! As mentioned in another review, I love that if you have to stop playing whatever your listening to it will pick up on the same track when you press play again, it also fits in my back pocket so I can walk around the house listening to anything while doing chores, the earpieces fit well, there is absolutley nothing wrong with this walkman! Those of you who seemed to have this walkman break in 2-3 weeks must not take care of your things. I love it, the price was great, so don't let the negative reviews stop you on this purchase!
The product works fine. It seems kind of strange that I had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that I needed. The Linksys unit is just attached to the bracket by pressure so I ran a long zip tie through the bracket and around the Linksys units to make sure they didn't pop off
Great sound. love the volume control on the wire. great fit to almost any head size or shape. Overall a great purchase and I love their product
Besides the fact that iPod is a skinny little waste of time, let's also mock the fact that it plays about two formats: whatever Mac plays, and MP3.  Woohoo.   What a selection.Then, we have the iAudio.  It has perhaps a half inch thickness, at most, over the iPod for the standard battery model (20gb and 30gb anyway; 60gb is as thick as an XL), though it includes so much more bang for your buck, even if some of that bang is kind of useless.  But come on; an FM radio isn't iPod standard?  Almost every other portable HD player has that by now.  About the only thing iPod has over iAudio is movie quality, which is, admittedly, better.  But I'm fairly basic; I'm buying it for my music, not to watch a bloody movie on a tiny screen.  If I want to do that, I'll buy a portable DVD player. For pictures, unless they're ridiculously high quality, this suits just fine.  But it's not the pictures you should be interested in when buying one of these sweet players; it's the sound quality.Which.  Is.  Marvelous.   It consistantly beats iPod, it has BBE equalizer, and it not plays MP3 and AAC, but WMA, WAV, OOC, and FLAC.   *FLAC.*   And if you download Rockbox (which is something you'll have to research on your own, kids), you can create themes, boost your battery life, and augment your listening pleasure even further.The only drawbacks are the battery life if you don't use playlists, skip around a lot, or play high bitrate files (all of which are fixed rather well by Rockbox), and the subpack.   What is a subpack?   It's a fairly good idea done badly.  It's a piece of [...] plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player.  In it are the power jack, line-out (which has a bad bass roll-off problem, unfortunately) and line-in jack, and USB port.   The general idea was to make the player smaller by moving all of these jacks onto something else, but it wasn't executed too well.  Buying a charger from [...].com solves the power jack and USB port problems nicely, and is recommended most highly.(And did I mention recording with the built-in mic is amazing?  You can get good quality concerts with this puppy.)Plus, it's black.  iPod comes standard white.  And the X5 is just better
I saw this at the store and hoping to get it in 3 months my other reciever caught on fire and was a 19 year old YAMAHA RX-900
This product worked very well, and was easy to hook up. For my use I had 3 video game systems using component video  optical audio, and the switching was very quick. I replaced separate manual switchers for toslink  component, and am happy with this product
This was the perfect TV for our needs:  It fits the space, is economical, has great picture size and quality, and lots of features.  It is a good blend of current digital and CRT technology.  Not an LCD and bulky as they come, but once in place it delivers a quality viewing experience.
It pairs quickly with laptops  bluetooth phones. Holds the gps module firmly and matches the look perfectly.The only gripe I have is it doesn't have an anti-slip surface so that I can throw it on the dashboard and not worry about it falling off.The battery lasts forever. I remember using it for 6 continous hors before switching off...mind you switching off because I had arrived at my destination
I love this product.  Unfortunately, I blew mine up in West Africa (my computer was not damaged), so when I returned I ordered another right away.  I wish that it were a little thinner, but I suppose you can't have everything....at least right now
I couldn't believe how great this CD case is! I had a ton of loose CD's all over the place because I didn't have any cases. With this I could hold them all with a ton of room to spare!
Bought these to use while doing my daily walks  mowing.  They work 100% better than the little "lipstick" antenna you get with the MyFi plus you don't have to use the earphones.  The only time I lose signal is if I'm really boxed in an area that doesn't face south.  It actually works in some areas inside my house.  The sound quality is good enough for a casual audiophile like me.  Besides, there ain't much in the way of other options.  This is my second pair because my first pair had the left channel crap out because of a broken wire after a year.  So I use them as an extra antenna in the kitchen when I want to use the FM tuner on the radio
Things that I like: (1) The option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable.  I was a skeptic about it before I purchased it, but really do like it.  Also, this is the first keyboard that I have used that allows for so many typing angles.  (2) The included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard.  Even if you don't have Windows Vista, you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs.  (3) The keyboard has no lag for me, whatsoever.  (4) I'm a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys, etc.  (5) This is a small change, but I'm using this setup on Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop.  The software replaced the large volume notifications (onscreen display showing volume level, mute, etc.) with a smaller more attractive style notification.  Me gusta.  (6) The curved keyboard is also comfortable.  It requires no time nor effort getting used to it.  (7) I haven't had any problems with the keyboard being "out of range."  (8) For the mouse, I'm switching from the Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 3.0, which is also made by Microsoft, to the Laser 6000 mouse included.  This new mouse is more comfortable. (not a huge difference, but noticeable.)  It is also lighter, and slides around with little effort.What I don't like:(1) The lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click 'Start' then 'Log off Windows.'  I would have liked the option to change the key to the Shut Down / Hibernate dialog instead.  I haven't found that option available, so far.(2) The keyboard is a little bit wider than others, but I don't find it to be a problem.  It's just different.  Having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width.Five Stars
I needed a replacement Receiver for a fairly modest home theater system. I wanted a bare bones 5.1 system (no 6.1, 7.1, 1kw audio power, satellite radio capable, etc.)  I only use the Receiver as an audio switch and let the TV handle video source selection.  Reviewers of the Sherwood RD-6500 liked the audio but thought the set-up a little confusing.  Being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me.  The price was certainly right, about the cheapest thing around (at [...]).  I bought the unit and have been completely satisfied.  I would have given it five stars but heck, nobody's perfect.  I had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality (full disclosure:  my ears are 79 years old).  The unit has one optical digital, one coax digital and several A/V inputs.  The remote lets you pick Video 1-3, CD, Tuner and Aux inputs.  You tell the system which audio source to use for each of these, one time and it remembers.  I liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present.  I was surprised to find how many premium HD movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in HD either.  I also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them.  On the negative side I, like other reviewers, bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub-woofer is required
I have used These Seagate Drives for almost 2 years now. They work nicely for editing movies, and I like the combo Firewire and USB2.0 interface. I trust these cheaper Seagate than the expensive LACIE (we bought a box full of lacie D2, they ALL fail in 6 months) or store brand drives. Hard drives are prone to failure. But Seagate has served my company well.using : Seagate 750GB, 500GB, 400GB. daisy chained....
Works great, looks great, no problems.  22" monitor for this price?  More than I expected!
I've held off reviewing this item until I actually got some alerts - and I got plenty of them over the weekend, so here it is....There seem to be a lot of complaints of this being hard to set-up - so many, that after having no problems setting it up myself, I'd worried I'd done something wrong.  Over the weekend, a number of thunderstorms  tornados rolled thorough my area - using the S.A.M.E alert system for my county - I received a notification for each warning.  I purchased this radio specifically for the S.A.M.E alert system, living in central Mississippi, we get tornado warnings all spring - I didn't want a 2am alarm for a tornado 3 counties north of me.  My one beef with the unit is the radio reception - even the included external antenna, it's spotty - ESPECIALLY the weather radio reception.  I'm not sure how far I am from the nearest weather radio transmitter, but living in the suburbs of Madison, I can't be too far.  If you're in a rural area, I'd definitely look into getting an external antenna (it has a port for a better external antenna than the telescoping antenna included)
Great product! Very pleased with my decision to get this over the 100 so I could replace my alarm clock. Set it up just for the counties near me and turned off all the alerts I was not interested in
I purchased a SanDisc 4 GB SDHC card for my camera. At the time it did not occur to me that neither my SanDisc Image Mate 6 in 1 nor my SIIG 18-in-1 Reader/Writer would not be able to read this new version of Secure Digital. Long story short-I called IOGear tech support and was assured that this reader would work although netiher their promotional materails nor their packaging indicates that it will. Bottom Line: It works and it was a very inexpensive ($10 at CompUSA) solution to my problem.
I got this yoke to use with Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Other people have said that the build quality is poor on this yoke, but what did you expect?  It's just a computer game controller, it's not meant to feel like an actual pilot's yoke.  If it were, it would probably be much, much more expensive!Yes, the plastic build makes it feel like just another joystick, but I've had it for almost a year and haven't had any problems with it.  Also, I rarely need to reconfigure it, so there's not an issue of "wandering" from the centre point.All in all, this yoke is fairly good and works well with Flight Simulator.  It certainly makes you feel a little bit more like you're a real pilot, but don't expect to feel any G-forces or anything else like that
This univeral DVD player comes packed very neatly in an Oppo cloth case and is very sleek.  The finish of the DVD player is excellent, however the remote is not up to snuff in this department.  This player can play PAL DVDs, it upconverts it to NTSC  1080i.  It's loaded with features that you probably won't see on most DVD players out there.  The upconversion works well though I'm not sure the color handling is the best.  The audio controls in the setup are awesome.  People have complained about the disc tray being flimsy/cheap, but I think it's just fine.  It's very quick to load and play.  You may want to keep the remote safely because if you lose or damage it you won't be able to control most of the features.  The HDMI cable that is included with the player is of good quality.  Probably worth around fifty bucks in the market.  Price to performance/features you can't beat this universal DVD player.  Buy one and you'll know
Can't say enough of this machine.  I view all DVD's in HiDef now and that is a BEAUTIFUL thin
I've had this for about a week, and it seems to be working very well. The "autoscan" feature is very nice since I seemed to forget to switch between "city" and "highway" with my older units.The voice prompts are very clear, and the automute keeps the annoying beeps to a comfortable level.I've had several radar detectors over the years, and this one certainly seems to be the best so far. It is also rated very highly in the amgazine articles I found
I have used these batteries in a variety of applications and find they perform very well. Can tell no difference in their performance vs the name brands
This is a direct comparision between the Linksys WUSBF54G and TrendNet 509UB.Both perform as expected when used as a standalone hot spot detector.Both perform as expected on Windows XP. Installation was quirky for both. After driver installation, inserting into USB slot it wasn't recognized at all. Fiddled around for awhile and it finally detected the device. Had to disable the notebook's builtin wireless before XP recognized the device.Client software does not detect a device under Windows Vista Ultimate RC2. I assume this will be true for Windows Vista RTM too. Inserting the device into a Windows Vista RC2 system often completely froze Windows Vista (had to hold down power button for complete reboot). Had to disable the notebook's builtin wireless before Vista recognized the device.Appears that the TrendNet and Linksys devices are so similar that they must be made by the same OEM or reference design. As expected, evaluation results are similar.1. Both devices seem to have same sensitivity, similar to notebook's internal wireless card.2. TrendNet device doesn't have Windows XP signed drivers so an extra click during install is requried. Also installing on new USB ports requires extra clicks.3. TrendNet device supports 801.11a whereas Linksys does not.4. TrendNet device sometimes crashes Vista Ultimate RC2.5. Neither device's software client works under Vista Ultimate RC2. This isn't a deal breaker for me as they both work under Vista Ultimate RC2 networking as a USB wireless key. You just lose the client software feature.6. The Linksys has a somewhat useful backlit LCD, TrendNet does not.7. Both devices work as standalone hotspot locators equal well.8. In hotspot mode, both devices show SSID, channel number, encryption mode, etc.Conclusion: For XP, I recommend the TrendNet so save the extra dollars. For Vista, I recommend the Linksys device as it never crashed Vista Ultimate RC2 whereas TrendNet device was gave occasional freezes
I am so grateful to all the reviewers of this product for convincing me to give it a try.  I have a six-year old Hitachi DVD player, and I lost the remote.  I couldn't play anything without it, because the buttons on the player don't allow me to select any tracks.  The instructions on this remote are incredibly easy.  It found my TV automatically, because it's set for a Sony TV by default.  When I had to locate a code for my DVD player, I got worried-- none of the 3 Hitachi DVD codes listed in the manual worked during the setup process.  But there's a search function to use in that situation, which allows you to scroll through all the codes in the chip's library till one works.  It found one within seconds, and I was up and running.  I think I'm going to buy this as a holiday gift for my siblings so they can get rid of all the remotes scattered around their living rooms
This is simply the best remote you will ever need for all your infarad remotes!  I have a Chinese satallite receiver that I could never get it to work with all other "universal" remotes.  I was able to teach this remote to work with it!  This is a small computer
I almost bought a new phone because it was not working. The ability to purchase this battery saved me some bucks
This is a great TV.  Bought after looking around for months.  Receive HDTV signals, about a dozen without cable box.  The number will continue to rise, but all of the main shows and programs are in HD.  Especially for sports fans almost every broadcast is in HD.  True you will only get about 720P resolution from the broadcast over the air currently, but when the Blue-ray HD movies are out in larger number and at a more reasonable price, this will become the standard.  And this TV has 2 HDMI ports so you are ready to go.  I have had another CRT sharp which I have liked, and this product is no different.  Picture is amazing.  Some analog channels dont look that great, but I am at the point where where I would rather watch whatever is on an HD channel.  Note:  I am in what is considered an upgraded cable section.  The TV has the tuner to receive HD without the box as I have said, but I can't speak to sections that are not "upgraded", so you may want to look into that.  Nice to receive without paying for extra equipment. 
If you're considering the ViaMichelin (under $200 GPS), you're probably trying to decide if a GPS that is more than $100 cheaper (much more than $100 in some cases) than its competitors is really any good. Honestly, I would have been skeptical too, however, a relative bought one of these units, and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before I decided to purchase one myself.My brief summary is that Yes, this unit is a good GPS and a great value. After using mine on a trip, I'd have a hard time justifying the more expensive models when this one works fine.Background: my GPS experience is limited to a 7-year old Garmin III Plus. I had to plan detailed trips on my PC using Mapsource, then upload the waypoints and routes to the GPS. It could be a time consuming process, and because the unit wasn't necessarily user friendly, my wife never learned how to use it.Enter the ViaMichelin. We just went on a weekend trip and had a chance to test the unit. Set-up time for the trip was about a minute - all I had to do was program in the street address of our destination.Now for the rundown.First - what it doesn't do well.a) Using it for the past two weeks (as a test only) around my home town, I was a little disappointed.  It never sent me the wrong way, but it didn't always take the best route.  Some of the routing issues were because of very new road construction in the area; and in some cases old "logging" roads are still in the database where new subdivisions have been built; and it may not calculate what my experience dictates to be the better route. Although this was disconcerting at first, I don't think it is a big deal as you'll see later.b) Macro-directions - i.e. for a several hundred mile trip. It will get you there, and if you're taking a route that involves some smaller roads between towns, this would be a good device if you aren't familiar with the route. But my route this weekend was very simple. Get to the interstate and drive. It didn't pick my preferred route to the interstate, and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four-lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate. (Although it did recover and finally suggest my route as I stubbornly drove "my way.") So, for a major trip, I'd recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route.  Use this device if you have a lot of mind-numbing turn-by-turn.Now, what it does well:a) voice prompts are great. It doesn't matter that it doesn't say the street names. Turn right in 300 feet is good enough - especially with the map that you can glance at.b) It did great around my destination towns of Charlotte, NC; Gastonia, NC, and Rock Hill, SC.  Did it take the best route as I drove from soccer fields, to hotels, to restaurants?  I don't know since I wasn't familiar with the areas, but the routes seems to be just fine, they got me exactly where I needed to go, and I never had to look at a road map.  And after all, this was the main reason I needed a newer GPS. It passed this with flying colors.c) My wife did some of the set-up while in the car. She'll be using this one on her on very soon.d) We wanted to find a particular restaurant, but didn't have the street address. The restaurant was in the Points of Interest database, and it took us right to it. Also, finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great.I also found a feature that was not listed in the 89-page manual.  From the navigation map, if you touch the screen, it has a "bypass route" option. It will give you some distant options (1 mi, 5 mi, etc.) then it will find a bypass route for you. So, if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam, this will route you off the interstate, take you up the road and bring you back on.  Obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving, but then it's going to try to turn you around and/or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer.  The bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out.In the future, I would like to do a side-by-side comparison w/ a more expensive (borrowed) GPS. Also, after more experience, I'd like to update this review.Bottom line: I am glad I bought this unit. I cannot imagine spending $100-$500 more on a more expensive model. Though the higher priced models may have better features, the value for the extra money just isn't there for me
One of the few of these type of items available on the market. I bought it with great trepidation after reading all the reviews. I had received some free drives from Newegg (Seagate) and needed to house them. This was a no brainer set up. The utility found it immediately without me having to mess around with turning virus protection or firewalls off. (XP pro SP2). The firmware was one rev prior so I updated it - absolutely smooth as silk. Reformatted the drives. I chose the RAID 1 option and ext3 format. I like the fact that you can specify RAID size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume. The drive is fairly solid. The fan is not very noisy. The front slide up access door is a little kludgy. Good user interface. I was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen RAID and ext3. The only thing I can never get to work and it is 100% MY lack of knowledge is the email alerts. I couldn't get Infrant to do it and same with this one.As an aside I love Amazon and NewEgg. Great retailers both of them
Had mine for over half a year now, and after outstanding abuse it performs as well as the day I bought it.  I fill it and empty it every month, rarely ever defragging it, back up my PC files and play movies right off it on my laptop.  Throw it in my backpack, plug and unplug it all day(hotswaping), still with rarely a sign of slowdown, and it barely gets from cool to warm ever(even when its running from inside my backpack).For some reason requires two usb ports on my new PC (high speed USB2.0 ports) when it shouldn't.  It runs on one port at school just fine and I have switched the y cable with a regular usb cable with 50% success.I'd buy another one of these in a heartbeat if I ever thought the one I have would run itself out.  The fact that it doesn't need an external AC adapter to run on my USB1.1 laptop ports(though it does have a hole for a non-included AC adapter)is a blessing.  I've even used its double usb cord to run my power hog of an external cd-rom drive(my cd-rom AC doesnt work on both sadly).  Might be luck of the draw, HD related items seem to be sometimes, and I've yet to have to try out their customer service.  But overall worth every cent spent(especially since I was looking at a 4GB external for $40 before I saw this). Nearly $1 a gig is a great deal.
This notebook case is a perfect fit for the MacBook, and it is compact enough to fit into larger bags.  It is exactly what I was looking for
This was a perfect fit for my 13" Macbook. Tried a couple cheaper ones, but was never satisfied, usually they were just a bad fit. This is by far the best, holds the computer in place and is light weight. It's true you get what you pay for. One complaint, the extra pocket in front could be larger
I originally bought this CD case for my car, because I listen to CDs the most while driving.  This was not a good case to bring back and forth at all.  It is very large and heavy (even without CDs!), and the long zipper-tail makes it hard to open with one hand.  I now use it to house computer software and playstation/gamecube games.  For what you pay, it is an excellent buy
seems pretty good.  doesnt come with any directions on how to transfer files from your "C" drive into it
This is a great value for money and it is very silent and soen not get hot.  It is also silent and convenient.  It is more flexible with the FAT 32 format it comes in but I preferred the NTFS file format whice is safer and more stable.  It was no problem to reformat to NTFS
This was exactly what I needed  it is very easy to use.  It does a great job of encrypting your data, if that is what you want.  There is plenty of space and it is snap to use with my Mac Powerbook.  I recommend it
This product is fantastic. Great sound with a small footprint. I purchased a JBL On Stage at first and it malfunctioned after only a few days. The CTA product has been great and it cost a lot less than the JBL product
I got the Griffin iTrip to enjoy my iPod in my car, and then I HAD to get a Belkin TuneBase for iPod mini! With the short battery life that is further aggravated when using the iTrip, the TuneBase keeps my iPod charged so that I don't have to plug it into my computer's USB port every night after work
I'm very pleased with my Iriver.  I have tons of room to store all my favorite songs and even sermons!  I do a lot of driving and I listen to it all the time
This is my second iRiver product. The first one was fine but it couldn't survive a trip through the washing machine. This one works well, is easy to navigate through, good sound. The case is rather cheap. The other one was rigid plastic. This case is hard to use and makes it difficult to change the batteries. The software leaves something to be desired so I use Windows Explorer to add songs and rearrange the order. All in all, this is a great little mp3 player
I use this on my MacBook. Works flawlessly to hookup a TV via svideo. OSX handles this supremely well by remembering any video settings that I use when i have it hooked up. Plug it in and video switches to tv settings, unplug it and its back to normal. I use this with dual view mode so that my desktop stays the same always on the macbook, and i just get extra desktop space when I plug the tv in.The quality is quite suprising for s-video, very good.100% must have for anyone that has a nice tv :
It works fine, but it gets really annoying when you're using it with a widescreen Mac and a widescreen TV. The zoom function most plasmas and LCD TVs have is 16:9 aspect ratio, whereas Macs are at 16:10 aspect ratio, so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you're trying to display, or have massive letter-boxing. After three months, I still haven't had any glitches that were this adapter's fault.If you have HDMI or DVI on your TV or projector, don't bother with this. Go straight to DVI with a Mini-dvi to DVI adapter, then get a DVI to DVI cord or a DVI to HDMI cord
Ya tengo una semana con el y lo recomiendo ampliamente La imagen y la nitidez de este monitor son sobresalientes Con una resolucion de 1680 x 1050 las fotos tomadas con mi camara digital se ven como una imagen real Tiene varios ajustes segun el uso que le quieras dar Viene en espaol
I bought this part and the addition that makes it a double shelf. I have my TV on it and it's great
Yes, it plays videos (DivX + Windows Media tested so far).Yes, it plays and sorts your photos.Yes, it plays MP3s and sorts them by their ID3 tags (artist/genre/album/etc.).Yes, it comes with a good TV audio/video out cable (letting you use the Zen like a high-def digital video player).Yes, you can download your CompactFlash card directly onto the Zen hard drive.Yes, it syncs with your Outlook tasks and calendar.  Wha?  Yeah.  It's hidden in there too.  Along with an MP3 alarm clock.If you're going on vacation with a digital camera anytime soon, this is the multi-tool for you.  Leave the laptop at home.  The Zen has plenty of battery life and plenty of room for music, movies and photos to keep you moving for days when you're unwired from the office
...I have been using this drive for a few months now and have no complaints.  One of my laptops only has a USB 1.x port and it is incredibly slower for backups.  That has no reflection on this product, but be ready for things to work slowly unless you have USB 2.x and don't blame it on this drive.  :
This product is perfect for anyone who has a thumb drive but no lanyard or other item already attached to it.  I could not find anything like this at any of the big stores i.e. Circuit City, HH Gregg, etc.  I hopped online and found this right away...thanks
I love the Sling Media Slingbox Tuner!  The install was very easy just as they had said on the reviews.  The quality of picture is just as good as on my Cable TV.  I have a great processor with the highest internet speed I could get though my cable so that may contribute to the good quality picture and color I get with it and may also be the reason I have had no problems with doing computer work and watching the screen at the same time. Plue my shipment from Amazon was in 2 days!  You rock Amazon!
I am very pleased with the Brother P-Tough QL-500.  The printing lables are a good price for the quantity you get. 
I BOUGHT THIS LIKE A IPOD BUT ITS BETTER I HAVE ABOUT 20 MOVIES ON IT AND ABOUT 500 SONGS AND SOME PHOTO'S AND STILL HAVE 50 GIGS LEFT. THE ONLY HANG UP IS YOU STILL HAVE TO GO PAY ANOTHER 20.00 TO GET THE PLUG-IN DOWNLOAD THAT LETS YOU SHOW MOST OF THE MOVIES. THEY SAY IT CAN DO ALL THIS STUFF BUT NOT WITH OUT DOWNLOADS AND SOME ADD ON'S ONCE YOU GET ALL THAT THERE ARE HOURS OF FUN TO BE HAD.
Excellent product - very ergonomic, easy to set up and use! Wireless works great.I would recommend this product
I like to a lot this product, and I work very well and also has a low price, to obtain this is a good offer for who buys it
So far this seems to be an extremely effective (and inexpensive) way to store pictures captured with a multi-mega pixel digital camera. The sevice provided by this company shipping-wise was very fast. All-in-all a great deal
After all the hype on-line about the T-amp, I had to check it out for myself.  All the reports are true!  This is one hot little audio amp which can not be touched for the price.  If you have a portable audio device and two speakers you need to drive with it - this amp is for you.  You will not be disappointed.  I recommend purchasing the AC power supply as well.  You can find others cheaper, but the recommended one works perfectly and insures the warrantee for the T-amp remains valid
Great sound form small box.Nice platform for tweaking.Good power needed
Ha sido una buena compra, es un procesador rapido y efeciente en las tareas multimedia
I purchased this as an extra phone so I could access both phone lines on the second floor of my house. Well-built with hold and 3-way conferencing features, sound quality is good and it has selectable ring levels for each line. Powered from the phone line, no external power is used. One drawback: the line indicator doesn't light when the line is being used by other phones in the house.
After reading several reviews of this product I was skeptical about buying this cable.  I wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my PS2 but I was not sure about paying the price for these when the Sony cables are about half the cost of the Monster Cables.  The reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the PS2 properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the TV almost discouraged me from even buying this product.  I decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my PS2.  I am very happy that I decided to buy these cables.  The cable connector fits perfectly into my PS2, better than the connector on my original Sony cables even.  The connectors fit nicely onto my TV, they are snug but not too tight.  I believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my TV because of the 8-cut turbine connector, which fits better than a standard RCA plug.  The video and audio from my PS2 is unbelievable.  My PS2 pushes the video signal to my 32" LCD HD TV at 480i with these cables.  With my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry.  Now the graphics are crisp and clear and I only wish I would have bought these sooner.  The display from my PS2 and games fits nicely onto my TV in widescreen now too, before the picture was not centered on my TV and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen.  I would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their PS2 over the stock Sony cables.  There are other Monster Cable versions for the PS2 available so choose the one that is right for you, but if you want something that is moderately priced, don't need digital audio via fiber, and the next best thing to HDMI than this is the cable for you.  I am going to get the Monster component cables for my PS3 next so I will be able to hook it up when I don't have HDMI available for it to use.One more thought, be sure to change the video output on your PS2 from RGB to Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr in the system configuration before hooking up your PS2 with these cables or it may not work.  My TV told me the connection was not supported and I did not have video output until I changed the video output setting on my PS2
I wanted something to use while mowing the lawn without emptying my bank account.  Cuts the lawnmower noise to a tolerable level, and the sound quality is decent.  Headphones are comfortable and adjust easily.  Unit collapses down to a more manageable size for transportation.  Good battery life
Yep everything is very cool...clarity...etc..but they should do something about clipping in the head of laptop..it is just dancing while I keep it on laptop.
Recently bought this receiver to replace a dead one.  There isn't really anything special about this receiver, but it a solid one.  The two year warranty tells me they stand by their product, in case of a problem (hopefully I won't need to use the warranty).  It gives good, clean power and sound.  Don't let the 75W/channel fool you.  This is a high current receiver and it has a good amount of power.  Time will tell, however, how well this receiver performs.  Also, for the price Amazon was selling for, I couldn't pass it up.
     Unit installed in seconds with no false starts or headaches of any kind. The base is wide and heavy and when placed on a mouse pad doesn't move around at all, even when I get a little too "into" my flight sim games. One can't beat the price either. For flying prop planes, I am very saisfied with the performance
First time I've ever written a review.  I'm not a high tech type, and sometimes it's nothing but frustration for me to deal with high tech stuff.  This remote was a breeze to program, and works fantastic.  My wife and daughter are even less high tech and love it.  Any problems with use, just press "help" and the remote with ask you questions and correct the problem.  Highly recommended
I bought this CD player to use in my car and it has worked beautifully!  When you consider what a fine CD player it is, and the incredibly low price, it is most certainly a Best Buy!
Plenty of room for my Creative Zen Nano player, ear buds and spare battery. I only wish for something other than BLACK! It is easy to misplace
Works as advertised and works really well. I purchased it to provide a serial port for a Virtual windows machine running inside Mac OS X. I used to have issues with other products, but not this one.
This cartridge is very light, easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality, durable black ink on the page. It is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that's great! (It even comes with an expiration date!) HP also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit. One thing that I didn't like, however, is that the ink can go quickly. If you print a lot, you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so. My needs are about 20 pages per week and I have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks. That's not good; although to be fair to this HP ink cartridge I am printing graphics. Four stars (well, maybe three and one half stars) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge. It loses points for not lasting longer.
Needed the adapter to charge my Shuffle, since the AC adapter I have is one of those older Apple ones with the Firewire connector. Suits my needs perfectly.No experience with any sound docks, however, so I can't comment on the performance flaws other people have brought up
Great headphones for running! They fit my ears perfectly and I don't have to worry about foam anymore.
Plugged right in and worked like a charm. No software to configure. Great buy. Great product
Portable, easy to use with any chip and really nice pix. I love being able to print from digital files on my ipod
I've been struggling with heat issues for quite some time with my gaming PC and have gone through numerous fans and combinations trying to find a way to keep it cool.  I had just about resigned myself to just running with the case open all the time until I bought this.  After shuffling my PCI cards around so as to allow a space between this and my 6800 Ultra I fired the machine up (and closed the case! ;-) and did some gaming, all the while keeping an eye on the temperature of the card.  This fan easily dropped the temperature on the card 5-7 degrees celsius when the graphics are running full bore.. once the chaos on the screen starts to subside, the cooling is even better.  As an added bonus, this will cool the card down quick once you exit your game.  I thought for sure that I would have to trade off cooling for a lot more noise and I was surprised to find that I had to listen for it in order to hear it.  About the only complaint I have on this is that the fan speed is manual with a slider on the back (which I knew when I bought it) so it is not temperature sensitive.  Still deserves 5 stars though
Just purchased earbuds at target.  Excellent sound quality, expected that much due to a previous of full headphones.  Even better once you find the right adjustable tip to fit your ear.  Well worth my 100 dollars, granted, I've only had them 5 to 10 minutes, but I won't be returning them any time soon
Bought it for my wife and she loves it. It keeps track of where you were and restarts from there. The display is small (no fancy menus like Ipod)but works well. Sound is excellent.Be sure to install the drivers and software. The software is small, simple and EASY to use - or you can just COPY/PASTE files onto it.If you DON'T install the drivers it only works at USB 1.1 speeds and takes a LOT longer to load songs. With drivers you get full 2.0 speeds
I've never had a problem with these DVDs.  They burn and play perfectly and I've never had a problem printing on them.  What's particularly nice about these is the printable area goes all the way to the hole.  It doesn't sound like a big deal but it makes for nicer looking DVDs.  By the way, I use an Epson Stylus Photo R300 to print great photos and DVDs
This Bluetooth remote device works as advertized with my Apple notebook.  Be sure to insert the Bluetooth card all the way into the printer slot before you begin.  I thought mine was in far enough at first, but it really wasn't.  One caveat:  I was hoping that the Bluetooth signal would be strong enough to enable printing from the next room, but it's not.  Also new users should know that they can set up their computer to handle both Bluetooth and cable at the same time
Works well for my mac and BT enabled Sony Ericsson phone.  Other than the built in drivers for the printer in Mac OSX, support for options within the card and printer are non-existant.  Still cant figure out how to manually force a realignment of the cartridges..
Length of ownership: 8 weeksThis puppy really reaches out. My laptop's internal intel/pro wireless sees about 6 networks but with the Hawking dish a typical haul is 20 networks. Thanks to some friendly neighbors I've said goodbye to my paid isp and now enjoy casual and free internet connections, and until metrofi completes its set up of free city-wide wifi I'll get by with that thanks to this neat Hawking device.Unless I need the next and more expensive step up for such wifi booster devices I hope the Hawking dish proves durable..after all it's been just 2 months of ownership so far, albeit good ones.Note: For me this device has not seemed very directional in that it will pick up off-beam signals fairly well. Also, placement by a window will help your reception
I purchased the Hawking HWU8DD on the recommendation of several other RVers. WiFi signals at RV parks tend to be unreliable. Until now, the built-in antenna on my laptop could "see" the signal at my park but could not access it. As soon as I installed the software and connected the Hawking antenna via USB port, I immediately accessed my campground's signal.  The Hawking antenna has solved a major problem for me.
These were double the price on another site! My little girl LOVES these speakers! She is using them with her pc.my ONLY complaint and it's my complaint and not my lil girl's...is that the sound quality is poor.  Obviously, not the speakers to get for real sound quality...but kids love them
My doctor recommended getting a wrist support when using my computer because I had previous carpal tunnel surgery.Ilove the way it comforts the wrist.The gel inside is different than other gel pads I had in the past.It really does give great support and comfort.It can prevent future problems for your wrist.Iam glad Amazon carries it
This product with the assoicated software (included) is everything you hope it is but really don't believe it will be.  The x-ray glasses you saw advertized in the back of the comic book when you were a kid cost you $1.50 to learn a lesson why you should be skeptical.  The Garmin is the real deal.  I bought it for my son (a high school state (Indiana)level miler).  When he took off for his first workout and got home an hour later, he uploaded his entire workout onto the computer and low and behold his whole course with speeds, times, street names, etc., showed up on our computer, starting with the satallite photograph of our patio!!!! 
I just made a long trip from Miami, Florida, all the way to S. Carolina, with a Explorist XL loaded with DirectRoute V3, everything worked just fine, I installed the software, unlock It, upload the maps, all with out any problems, the unit was very fast and accuracy didn't need to keep it over the dashboard, from inside the vehicle worked very well, never took more than a minute to track all satellites, the street route where very accurate, never  got lost, working with POI's was very simple, didn't have any problem handling very large maps I really recommend this unit
I gave my mother-in-law my old Color SporTrack so she could start Geocaching.  I was in search of a handheld unit with a bigger brighter screen.  This unit is it. Although it is large, it has features I like: AA batteries (19 hours?, we'll see), easy menu navigation, USB connection to a PC and a rugged case.I am an engineer so am kind of picky about user interfaces, etc.  I have sent in a list of problems I have found with the menu navigation. All of them can be worked around, but it doesn't work the way I think they intended.  It will be interesting to see if Magellan gets back to me and eventually provides a new version of FW (I am using 1.05).After doing a lot of research about Megllan SW (mostly negative), I decided to go ahead and purchase the Mapsend DirectRoute v.3 DVD. I found it acceptable and have had no real problems using it. One nit, the files it creates are very small.  You need to edit a text file in the Magellan directoy to allow it to save and download larger files. But once you get the maps downloaded to your unit (very straight forward), the menus change to indicate turning direction.  Thus, it is getting closer to a crossover unit.  Interestingly, Magellan will offer a new unit called the "Crossover" (available January 2007). The specs are pretty sparse on the Magellan web page
Does the job nicely. I am not an audiophile so I dont get into the nit picking when it comes to speaker wire. Just tell me what gauge to use and I do it. Seemed high quality to me
This bag is very good.  The outside phone jack is a plus.  The only negative - hard to access the other DVD's when in use
Arrived on time and is perfect for using headphones and speakers at the same time.
I also purchased this product because of the quality of the receiver made by Sony. This 7.1 channel Home Theater with HDMI passthrough is a great machine that money can buy. If you are looking for quality, surround sound in your livingroom, or your own Home Theater, this s the product you should invest in. This is a great investment for me. I am glad I found it in Amazon
The Lexar JumpDrive Lightning 2GB flash drive has very impressive performance ratings of 160X (24MB/sec) sustained Read and 120X (18MB/sec) sustained Write speed capability.  This is one of the very few USB drives that lists the Read/Write speed capabilities.The "reality" of flash drives is that the smaller the file size, the slower the transfer rate will be.I ran some tests with the Lightning to see what the transfer rate and the elapsed time is for groups of various file sizes:* 433MB	 784 medium files, avg. 550KB	12X	4 min. 3 sec. * 483MB   81 large files, avg. 6MB      54X	59 seconds * 1GB	   1 very large file           115X	58 secondsSo, even though the Write speed capability of the Lightning is 120X, the transfer rate drops to 12X with medium size files, which is fairly "real-world" usage.  But, don't let that dissuade you from considering the Lightning:  The higher the "speed capability" of the device, the better the transfer rate will be and the less time it will take to transfer those smaller files. To prove this point, I took one of my "great deal" CF cards (that had no speed ratings) that tops out at 36X Read / 7X Write, and ran two of the same tests: * 433MB	784 medium files   3X	15 min. 10 sec. * 483MB	 81 large files    7X	 7 min. 48 sec.So, compared to the Lightning, the "great deal!" card took nearly 4 times longer to Write the medium files and 8 times longer to Write the large files.  So, which is the better deal when you use the device over and over and over...Whether you are shopping for a card or a stick for digital cameras or a USB flash drive, if the performance numbers are not specified, BEWARE!  What you might think is a great deal may get you a device with very poor performance that you will regret purchasing.  I know, I have several in my drawer.So, my bottom-line advice is:  Look for the highest-rated device you can find.  Flash devices will last a looong time and our file sizes and amount of data will only grow!  So "future-proof" your purchase by shopping for a high-rated and large capacity for now and the future.(I have no relationship with Lexar or the Flash memory industry.
This is a solid device, and I like the included software for burningb dvd as well as c
I haven't had any problems using this DVD/CD burner over Firewire on a G4 iMac running Mac OSX Tiger. In fact, setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual; it was truly plug-and-play.Minor quibbles: the open/close button is hard to reach when the disc tray is extended, the black plastic face of the drive looks cheesy compared to the cool aluminum case, and only the Lite version of Toast 6 is included.Bottom line: I would buy this burner again, given my experiences using it
The product works great. What i didn't like was not having the attachment to charge the battery in my home. It only came with the cigarette lighter power source. I had to purchase the other power source seperately. I also had purchased the 3000 model previously and it came with both power sources. Why is that
the cam is good...it has a special feature to show the person/object by automatic adjustment...and a very good part abt it is, it has a built in mike and helps a lot..
Bought these stands after much research, was looking for a good stand at a fair price. These serve the purpose. Great stand , great price.
I bought this SD card and took some 100 snaps out of it.The card is really fast with my canon A510 camera.Reading takes a slightly longer time than writing.I would recommend this card to anyone.Actually this card outperforms the 16MB MMC supplied with the camera.Also the 256MB card will hold upto 200 (may be lesser) 3.2MP pictures.
I purchased this card a month ago. I use it on my Dell Axim X3i. So far it has been fully compatible, fast, and flawless. I haven't owned another PDA or SD card so I can't give you a first-hand benchmark. But I can say that accessing the card is quick and I have not had any skips while playing my music files. The 256MB is good for the price if you wait for Amazon to drop their price in conjunction with the manufacturer's rebate
I got my replacement battery and put into the computer.  The date started working whenever the computer is off and I haven't had any problems
the Klipsch igroove can go toe to toe with the more expensive bose sound wave all day long. I researched dockable ipod / mp3 players for a few months before I decided on this one for my wife's office. I'm fussy when it comes to quality audio equipment, the I-grove does not disappoint. It provides room filling sound with no distorion. I listened to it extensively before wrapping it up for xmas to make sure it had the quality I insist on. It delivered.Another bonus with the Klipsch is it's ability to accomodate other mp3 players and / or personal compact disc players.I'm completely satisfied with my purchase of the Klipsch i-Groove.
I'm sure these earphones work and sound fine but I was looking for something softer/smaller for my apparently small earholes.  :
I bought one for a relative last Christmas. Saw how convenient and easy it was to program. So I bought one for myself this March. It works just great.The setup software programs the 670 easily and the Logitech remote replaces the remotes for a HDTV, a DVD Home Theater A/V Receiver, a DishHD DVR Receiver, and a Psyclone PSC01 Source Selector.  One button click now setups all those devices to the right status for a particular entertainment activity. I like the color screens and icons on the higher end  Logitech remotes .. but the discrete placement of buttons on the 670 is much more practical for me to use. Function wins forms this time round.All is not rosy though. Added the Sony PS3 to the   entertainment arena.  The Bluetooth requirements of the PS3 leaves it out of the IR RF remotes inner circle. Consider this  if you need a combined solution for Infra Red  RF as well as Bluetooth devices. ( The Sony PS3 is deliberately left powered on so it is not an issue in this case). Fully backlit is a signifcant bonus..none of the replaced remotes had adequate backlit features. Short version: This cool tool really works and should satisfy most. Think "out of the box" though if you have a Sony PS3 tied into your entertainment network. ..click
My wife and I have maybe a dozen or so devices connected via WiFi spread throughout our four-bedroom home. Among these were an Avaya 4610SW SIP (VOIP) phone and a PC serving as an Asterisk server (Asterisk is an open source PBX). This configuration has worked well for a couple of years now. In the past few months I've been having occasional disconnects of VOIP calls coming in to Asterisk from the PSTN. After some investigation, I decided to move my phone and server off WiFi and onto a HomePlug network, using the electrical wiring as another Ethernet. The hardest part of the installation was freeing up an electrical outlet in my second-floor office where my phone is, in the basement where the server is, and in the family room on the first floor where the LinkSys WiFi router/access point is located. After that, it was just a matter of plugging in an Ethernet cable from the Netgear box to the router, and moving the Ethernet cables from the WiFi boxes for the phone and server to the Netgear boxes. It was that simple.[...]I wish all high-tech equipment were this easy to install
I purchased this for my teenager to use with her IPod Nano. I shopped around for a while before I finally decided on this one because it came with losts of accesories and she uses it everyday all the time and says it works perfectly. I've only had it for a month but it's holding up in the hands to a teen and no complaints so far.
We love the card scanner, it's the best. Everyone who is a recruiter should have one it saves time and space
I have, and have had, lots of SW radios including a number of Sonys.  This is one of their many gems.  Great perfomance, lots of memories and snazzy look. Good for travel (certainly not as compact as the SW100, of course).  A great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio, and don't want to spend very much. Good for listening, and good for DXing while traveling.  Look no further
Good job making a sturdy case that does not add too much bulk to a very thin device.  My major fear was that this would make my 1955 too thick and I would not use it.  It is just right and great protection for my 1955 - by the way I replaced a 4150 with this 1955 and case because my daughter accidently sat on my 4150 and broke the screen.  It is a great piece of protection
I bought this phone and three expansion handsets about a year ago and couldn't be happier.  The phones have the clarity of a corded phone.  The built in intercom system is perfect.  The phones allow you to "name" the handsets as we did (Kitchen, Basement, Bedroom, etc) so you can page based on location rather than remembering numbers.  They have a reliable and effective speakerphone built in, as well as jacks for headset (though the speakerphone seems to make this unnecessary.One problem with these phones is the batteries.  In the year that we have had them, the battery life on all of the phones has degraded severely.  Often my wife would be on conference calls for one to two hours, and we would go through all four phones.  Leave a phone off the charger and in a day it's useless.  The only solution was to replace the batteries (which was significantly cheaper and easier than buying new phones and re-programming all the phone numbers).  I recommend the Energizer ER-P240, which is a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery and won't develop the Ni-Cad memory effect.I love that the base station has a place for 4 AAA batteries so that the system can still be used during a power outage
What can I say, it's an ink cartridge. You get a lot of pages out of it, its great quality, and thats about it
I can't describe this MP3 with words "great"It's more than great.It fits my pocket, and it's music quality is great.My sister and I bought this incredible MP3 with doubts but, it is more than great.If somebody is considering buying an MP3, I strongly recommend to buy this iRiver.Thank you, thank you, thank you
These speakers can almost hit any range of sound, but if anything they are a little weak on the bass side.  They put out very crisp sound for my system.  You might want to add a sub to them for complete range sound
If you're looking at this page you probably already know a lot about HP calculators.  Chances are you either had a 32SII and don't want to go the Ebay route or wanna slim down from that 48/49 series because you don't really need that extra functionality.  Is the 33S perfect?  No, not by a long ways, but it's the best thing we've got.  If you want a new scientific RPN calculator this is it.  
This battery will transform your Epson PictureMate Deluxe Viewer Edition from a nifty little photo printer into an absolute Must Have item ! I take it with me when ever I'm doing an off-site photo shoot, or even when I'm out for a weekend shooting candids. The portability you get by adding this battery to the printer is priceless. I have printed as many as 40 photos on one charge.
Not so many words to talk about this item, but let me tell you that now I always use my rino turned on, in my car. baterie drain its no more cash pain!**Good things:-comes with a led(small light) that turns on with diferent colors(red green yellow) so you could know if your rino its turned on or of or disconected.-large cable(for a car, you could use youre rino in the back seat even conected in the front of the car)**bad thingsjust a bad ending quality, it looks like a adapter of 2.99bucks, but I had owned it for more than a year and cero problems.pvpaco@gmail.co
I have had this item for about 6 weeks.  Haven't used to a lot, but so far I like it.  This power inverter is smaller and looks nicer than my old one, which was stolen out of my car along with a few other things.It has one electrical outlet, and above that is a cigarette lighter outlet, so if you have other devices that need that kind outlet you can use them while this power inverter is plugged in.  The plug fits kind of loosely in my cigarette lighter outlet, but I don't know if that's the plug or the outlet on my car.  The only thing I don't like about this item is the "no tangle" cord.  Its one of those coiled up cords, like a telephone cord (look at the picture of the item).  The cord is long enough that it could stretch to the backseat, but if I were to try this it would pull the plug out of the outlet.  Its coiled so tight that I couldn't really put it anywhere that would require the coil to be stretched.  It just annoys me that they call it a 36" cord.  For practical use not more than probably 18", but I don't have the item right in front of me to measure it.I'll still give this item 5 stars.  4.5 if Amazon allowed 1/2 stars. 
How often are you on the way to work or to a meeting and you end up getting stuck in the traffic jam of the century. Nobody is moving and you can tell it's going to be a while. It would make sense to brush up on those reports or your presentation while you're stuck, but who wants to eat up the battery on their laptop right before a presentation? This inverter allows you to plug in your laptop into your car - just like a wall outlet - no worries, work off your car's alternator instead of your battery and catch all your typos before you get to your appointment
It was up and running in 15 minutes. Had to order WiFi adapter to get program updates - got it and it installed automatically. I would buy it again
This might be the best thing Apple has ever made, it works perfectly with my Mac Book Pro and my PCs. The security is awsome and it has great range with easy instalation. After many flaws with my Lynksys, I took the risk with this and it was worth it. I have NEVER had a problem with this
Seems sturdy, however, it did not fit my TV. Will not fit Samsung LNS 4692D
I bought this for my new Sony Ericson W300i phone so that i could actually put some music on the phone. It came with a MS pro adapter which is nice because I have a slot on my computer for that. It is fast and just what I wanted
This thing is selling in the Best Buy with $53.33 + tax. I bought that in here for under $40 with free super saver shipping in Jan. It's working very well until now with my SonyEricsson K800i
Which was Nomadland.  The Bono-pod is beautiful.  However the inconsistency of the iPod itself is a nightmare.  I've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs.  It's apparently a known problem with several models of the device, with no particular fix.  Great. 
This is an exact replacement for the high quality, precision made suction cup mount that comes packaged with the Nuvi unit. Unlike many such suction cup products, this one sticks. I bought an extra for ease in "cross-decking" my one Nuvi unit between my two cars. I just leave the mounts in place on the windshields of both cars and move the Nuvi and power cord to whichever car I am using at the moment. A good convenience. Note that I attach this mount to the windshield. I have not tried the red-disc mounting plate that allows the mount to be attached to a pebbly-textured dashboard... I was scared off by the warning that ones you attach the red disk it is extremely hard to remove.
This has been an excellent purchase.  Well worth the price. Excellent color and clarity
It was great that the Nikon D8 purchase included a SanDisk MicroMate with USB connection
As of 2007 most of the bugs mentioned in the other reviews are fixed. The ipod fits snug as a bug in my unit and it even charges it.Youu can even find this as low as $140 or chaper.  Im not sure why the bad reviews.This is a wonderful dvd player and the newer one i got even plays your ipod through your tv if you want..older versions did not allow this. You should buy this.The video quality isnt great, but good,  thats why i gave it four stars instead of five It is bulky but you need room for the ipod to plug in. the only bad side is no ipod naviation from the menu. you must use the ipod itself..But being able to play your ipod and dvd through any tv with rca jacks (audio/video) is great..i can now backup my purchased ipod items to dvd since i have an eyetv250 which allows you to use your computer as a tv. the eyetv has rca jacks on the device which allows me to record it to my harddrive which i then use toast to burn my dvd..all in all its completely worth it. even as a stand alone dvd player it's great..never had the first proble
This router functions great in the household environment.  It is VERY easy to install and security is equally as easy to set.
This keyboard is the best i've ever used. The backlight is excellent and the keys just have that unique touch that just soothes your fingers. Great and cool design. i recommend this keyboard all the way! Im typing on it right now by the way.
What can I say, I got a code at Chrismas time through the Amazon promotion and got this tv for $200. It's perfect for a master bedroom set and the picture is great. Why spend so much more than the regular Amazon price for a more expensive brand when you can get this tv? No problems and it works wonderfully! Great deal, with free shipping even! Time and again, Amazon is great
I purchase this on Amazon for $499 no tax  free shipping. You can not match this quality at this price. The HD with HDMI cable using Comcast digital box is outstanding. The sound is also better with the HDMI vs componet cables. The jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode. The picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color. I looked at Samsung for $800 and I am glad I saved myself $300 with this LCD
I use an i-Pod mini in my car.  It is in the center console where it connects to the auxillary input.  I used to have to open the console to make changes or turn it on or off.  The air click allows me to do all of that with the remote that I leave in a tray outside the console.  It works just as it is supposed to with no problems at all.  It solved my problem and I am a very satisfied customer. 
I have my iPod hooked up to the stereo on my motorcycle. The iPod stays tucked away in a safe place, and the remote gets strapped to the handlebar. All the needed functions are now at my fingertips. I can lock the iPod control pad, so it doesn't accidentally get bumped.I also use the Griffin FM transmitter. Nice, but not nearly as slick as the remote. I can't use them both at the same time, but I don't need to
This one of those products your girlfriend wonders why you are wasting your money on, that turns out to make life so much easier.  It has allowed me to leave my ipod in my backpack on my way to work, and go through security to get into work, all without having to open my bag.  The remote has a velcro strap that I use to attach to the shoulder strap of my back pack.  I am able to start and stop tunes and change the volume without needing to pull the ipod out.  My only complaint was that the headphone jack should have a strap or something to help keep the headphones in all the way and the device could also have a strap.  As the device is made for active people it would be nice to know that everything would stay connected, because when things do come undone, you do have to open your bag and put it all back together and that defeats the point of having the air click.
This was a great buy, Item was as described. A++++++++++
The item works as I expected. I received within the tiem offered by the seller. I'll buy again from this merchant
After having my GPS come loose (barrel pin failure) on more than one occasion I decided to give this a try. I've now used this on a 2 month MTB tour of Nepal and Tibet. Held my Forerunner 301 securely on hundreds of miles of washboard, technical singletrack, etc. Also withstood countless grabby children and curious bystanders in numerous villages. You do NOT have to remove the wrist band to use it with the mount. I love the reassuring "snap" when it locks into the mount, and the wrist strap functions as a safety back up - although it never came loose from the mount on me. Convenient release allows you to remove it quickly and easily. My only very minor complaint is you have to remove the GPS from the mount to charge it.It fit perfectly on my 1" (25.6mm) diameter bars.Like it so much I just ordered the "oversize" mount for my motorcycle.
Very good product. You do need to use help menue for instructions because the paperwork that comes with it doesn't tell you a lot.Overall I'm having fun using this product
I bought this in lieu of the Fuji counterpart which was out of stock in Amazon. Since the Fuji Finepix E900 runs on AA batteries and its AC powercord/supply is an option one has to buy, this reader is a cheap, quick and even more portable alternative for downloading pix to my Mac
I'd been using wireless for gaming for the past 3 months and always had lag problems even if the latency said it was around 50. I got the set of these and they work awesome. Just plug one into an outlet next to your pc and one next to your router. Run the cat5 cables from one to the pc and one to the router and you are all set. Now I can do my gaming without the lag I got from wireless and have yet to have any problem with these. These are truly plug and play. Now if only they were a little cheaper
I purchased the LJ3390 to replace an existing LJ3320.  The $350 rebate available until the end of Oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase.My main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer.  Duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the LJ3390 over the LJ3052.I now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully.  All run XP SP2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection.  Software installation went flawlessly.While I can't comment about HP versus other vendor software, I can say that the LJ3390 software is a major improvement over that of my LJ3320.  Scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2X, quite likely more like 3-4X.  Printing of complex pages is also much faster, exactly what I would expect from a newer generation print engine and an HP Laserjet printer.All in all I am very pleased that I upgraded.  It has met all my upgrade goals.  Printing is faster, scanning is much faster.  The network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on.  I haven't played with the fax side yet, but am hoping this finally let's me retire my trusty standalone fax machine.
MVSV3 Gives excellent color with a vivirant and vivid feel.     Deffinently a high porformence wire in its class,and worth the buy
This unit is battery powered and mine arrived with a dead battery, however, replacing that was quick and easy although irritating. After installation and use for a while, I noticed the unit also got rid of some direct dialed calls as well as computer generated calls. If you don't speak immediately after pickup, the telemarketer hears the tone and hangs up! Great Item..
I bought the Telezapper from John Whitaker and it was delivered in 3ays. It didn't work so I contacted John and he told me to return it and he would test and if it didn't work he would send me a new one . He was good to his word and promptly send sent one that worked. He's the best:)Ben. Rodrigue
Works as it should. It's enough for my needs and handles simultaneous activity on all ports well. Not an unbearable dropoff in performance while say, transferring huge files to an external hard drive, while burning a DVD, and fiddling with the iPod. If you're like me and you need your laptop to do a little more without adding to desk clutter uneccesarily, this should suit you fine
This product is simple to use and has all of the functionality I need while presenting
Got 3 of them a few months ago, and buying another one now.  Excellent product, fits many different plug types. No flaws.
I agree with Max.  Don't use those inferior cables that come with your DVD player.  I just bought a DVD player and immediately got these Monster cables to connect between the TV and DVD.  Image quality is the best I can get on my 20 TV, really cool
I received this product from an Amazon.com seller for 1/2 the price of what Best Buy was selling it for. It was new and in an unopened box. Upon opening the box I was able to tell right away that it was built very good.  The hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere.  I had spent over $300 for a Runco antenna for my Runco projector for local HD (DirecTV does not have local HD in my area) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80% reception with it.  This antenna with a similar design the the Runco model is built better and I get between 94-98% reception depending on the channel (directional antenna so reception varies slightly).  I was also amazed with the fact that I not only get local channels for Youngstown Ohio, but I also get locals with over 60% reception from Cleveland (direction antenna is facing) but also Pittsburgh (which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing).  Great product and no issues with it so far.  The included booster works better than the one built into my DirecTV receiver, so I advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector (if it has a built in HD tuner) or TV for best results
I've had mine for 10 months now and it's been very reliable; not one problem with it. It's quick to print out the first page, the display is a monochrome LCD with a backlight so you can see in dark spaces (say, if you keep it under a counter), no paper jams, no nonsense. Also, if you're an Apple owner the drivers are already included with OS X; truly plug n print. What's a real treat is to combine it with an Apple Airport Express and use Apple's Bonjour software to easily convert it to a wireless network printer. Bonjour is available for both OS X and Windows computers, and is a breeze to install. I highly recommend if you're in the market for a multifuntion monochrome laser printer machine that is compatible with both Windows and Mac OS
I bought this for my daughters Sansa e230 mp3 player and could not be more satisfied. I was leary of the price, but this unit is worth every penny. Recharges your player and has awesome sound for the size, while plugged in or with batteries. No regrets about this purchase
The reception is much better than my old antenna, however, I was expecting instructions to be included with the antenna.  After some time I figured out how to hook up the tv and vcr to the antenna
I am quiet satisfied with the T10. 3 cons: no reset button, AA battery type (I prefer litium ion) , primitive menu.3 Pros: mp3 + voice record + fm radiogood sound qualitybelt clipOverall success: 80 %
I owned a Bose wave radio for a number of  years. The price was well beyond my financial means, but I made the sacrifice, and I'm very glad I did. The sound defied belief, and  I was very pleased. You will be, too. Forget the detractors herein. They know nothing, like the "reviewer" who listened to AM Radio. If the sound of frying eggs is appealing to you, then, any radio will suffice. But if a clear sound is what you're going for, then go buy a Bose Wave Radio! You'll be glad you did. I know that I am
Bought this to convert PAL Hi-8 (Canon) purchased years ago in Singapore for Mac (PowerBook G4, Tiger OS-X) nonlinear editing. Worked perfectly the first time, only needed to set a single switch to select PAL. No need for software drivers etc. Happily plugged and played with the Mac and the camcorder.Acceptable price for the features and ease of use.
Installation time was only about 20 min. Hook up the Digital and analog cables, and it configures itself. It took me a while to decide which resolution to use that was best for me, but once I found it, I was really pleased with the size and clarity. Music composition is much easier with the big screen. One small con was the stand is not adjustable, but it fit perfectly into my office space, so I didn't need the adjustment. The video quality on this LCD is amazing.Ronnie Be
After enduring the so-so performance of my stock ipod headphones, I figured it was time to step up.  As I travel constantly, I wanted something that would would block out exterior noise; as a music freak I wanted something that would sound great.  After countless hours of research and even more time debating on what brand of headphones to get (UE vs. Shure vs. Etymotics) I bought the Super.fi 5 pros.  In the end it was the price, Amazon was selling then for $90 less than the MSRP. Can't beat that.As soon as they were delivered I hooked them up and put them on.  They aren't kidding when they tell you to turn your audio device way down.  I keep the volume on my ipod way down, a fraction of what I kept it at with the stock headphones.  The room I was in faces a major road and we had the windows wide open, so to say there was plenty of ambient noise would be an understatement.  With the UEs on, it was just me and the music.  A fire engine thundered by, normally a painfully annoying experience.  Again, the UEs reduced it to the point that I didn't realize the fire engine was coming until I saw it drive by.As for the music.  I first played a couple of tracks by Jenny Lewis and the Watson Twins.  I immediately noticed elements to the music I never even heard with my other headphones.  Jenny Lewis' angelic voice came through so beautifully clear it was like I was listening to them for the first time.  Next I put on some Ray Charles.  With the UEs, it was like I was there in the front row.  The horn section nearly kicked me out of me chair while I discovered that there was indeed a woodwind section.  I've read complaints that in ear headphones don't produce enough bass, so I decided to see for myself and played a couple of tracks from Siamese Twin by The Smashing Pumpkins.  While I'm not by any means a bass head, I need some bass to enjoy rock albums.  I couldn't have been happier with how the UEs performed.  The drums in the album (which I've always considered some of the best) came alive.  The guitars actually had some balls, but didn't overpower the singing or drums.As is the case when you stick things in your ears for a period of time, your ears are bound to hurt a little.  I found this to be the case only for a day or two, after that the UEs fit snugly without any complaint.  The only weird thing I encountered had to do with ear wax.  My wife, an audiologist, forbids the family from using Q-tips.  So after taking the UEs off for the first couple of times, there was a nice deposit left on the tips of the headphones.  Like the discomfort, this earwax experience only lasted for the first couple of times I used the UEs, and with the supplied earwax cleaner it was really a non issue.When there are so many excellent products out there, finding the perfect headphones becomes extremely challenging.  I've never tried on Shures or Etymotics, so I can't compare the performance of those headphones and the UEs.  What I do know is that I got a really great deal on the best headphones I've ever had.  Without a doubt these are the last pair of headphones I will buy for some time. 
After looking at $250.00 mounts, I was unsure about order at this low price.  This is a great, well built unit. I would have no problem puttinga 130 lb. unit on it if you follow the enclosed instructions.  Hardware for most walls included.  Well painted with no rough edges.  Mine was installed over wall board into wood studs.  I used the awl to make sure I hit the studs dead center. Delivery from New York to Sarasota, Fl. was 5 days.  Can't bet that
Basically, This backpack is all that I need in a back pack. Very well padded, very roomy, fits an HP Pavillion dv8000 17" laptop. Its very attractive and after a month on use shows no signs of ware and tear. Definately worth the $. Unlike my previous packpacks The straps adjust so quickly and easily that I adjust them every time I put the pack on or take it off. Great Product!!!
I purchased the docking station for potability when on the beach, at the pool or camping.I had it going nonstop for 8.5 hours on the same set of batteries it was still going strong.I would by again
this is good for when you go on a trip you know it will keep your streetpilot going. and it isn't bulky. and it's made with quality just like the streetpilot itself
It's a decent mic for just a few bucks.  It works adequately, and has an on/off switch, and an XLR connector.It comes with a XLR-to-1/4 cord.  If you're going to plug this mic into a mixer, be sure to get a XLR-to-XLR cord.  The volume of the mic, when connected to a mono 1/4 jack with the included cable, was almost inaudible.  With a XLR-to-XLR cord, it was at normal volume levels compared with other equipment
La instalacin del producto fue bastante simple, la configuracion y operacion tambien los son, solo he observado un problema con el control remoto, en ocasiones deja de funcionar, no controla el volumen ni cambia los caneles de cable, solo despues de oprimir el boton de apagado y luego de vilver a activarlo es que regresa la funcionalidad de los botones de control de volumen y selector de canales; otra observacion en el funcionamiento es que al seleccionar en forma progresiva canales estos saltan al siguiente
Never a better caluclator in existance.Used it all thought Calculus classes and Computer Science. It does everything. Fast, smooth, pretty print flawlessly and more memory then a herd of elephants. Even does 3D graphing excellently. Spherical trig? not a problem at all and fully graph it, slice it up and zoom in.Also a few sites on hacking the TI-92 Plus that you can google for anyone intrested
Great buy for the money. four stars only because it is made out of about 3/8" mdf and could be sterdier. Height is great for medium size bookshelf speaker tweaters to be at ear level while siting on the couch
Use Canon ink with you Canon printer and you'll have no problems, just excellent pictures
Very good quality sound, loud ring, substantial weight (not all cheap plastic with no heft).  Only con is that even on "low" the ringer is very loud
This is an AWESOME little device. Let me start with the pros: 1) EASY: Incredibly easy setup (literally press one button - never believed it, but it's true. Plug in the usb transmitter, press the blue button  voila.) 2) GOOD SOUND: For a small set of speakers, these things sound great. They are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system, but sound very good and comparable to a $45 two-speaker set of monitor-side speakers. There's a built in sub-woofer that helps as well. 3) WIRELESS RANGE: With 4 AA batteries, you can carry this little guy around your whole house - and outside your house. Reception is great. I am used to bluetooth headsets that don't really work much further than 10 feet from the phone - I had doubts about bluetooth speakers, but I am amazed with reception these guys have. 4) CONTROLS: the Forward, Reverse  Pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both Media Player or Yahoo Music Engine running on the laptop(the only two I tried). Again, I was surprised, but they worked flawlessly. 5) COOL: As far as cool factor, this little guy is definitely that. Cons: 1) NO REMOTE: It would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound, FF, RW, Pause, Play controls. 2) NO CONTROL FROM PC: You can't control the sound (or mute) from the laptop - only from the speakers. 3) SOUND: Above I said the sound was good - and it is considering the size of this system. However, these are small speakers and a mini-sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too. It's good, but it's not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system. There is base but not a great deal - you definitely won't feel the music with these speakers. 4) VOLUME: Volume is limited - it's enough to fill a mid-sized room, but not much more. For $100, this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with NO WIRES. Carry it to your kid's room. To the garage. To the basement. No wires, nothing. If convenience is and portability is important to you, and if medium sound quality is ok, then I would HIGHLY recommend this speaker system. It's great. Personally, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them because I would really like fuller sound (this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room) and more base - but they're so cool and convenient, that I doubt I'll be able to give them up! FOR OTHER BLUETOOTH IDEAS AND WI-FI NETWORK OPTIONS, see my post at the Hydrogen Audio forum: [...]
I bought this for my wife. I have an iRiver HP120, which I consider to be one of the best ever made. I have to say, I think this is a great little player. The interface is well designed, the unit is well made, and the sound quality is excellent. I purchased a U2 about 1 year ago as a gift, which was also excellent. I think Cowon is making some of the better MP3 players on the market now, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality unit
The parallel USB adapter worked just like it was supposed to. My problem was that the printer I was using it with was no longer supported in Windows XP. So while the adapter turned out to be useless, I'm keeping it for possible future use
I ordered this product and it arrived 2 days later. It is genuine Canon ink for a great price. I will definitely buy at amazon.com again
I've had Canon printers using this cartridge for more than a year and won't settle for any of those knock-offs. Yeah, they're often much cheaper, but this is one area where you get what you pay for. Brand X fades and does not perform as well in the inkjet system. This has been confirmed in independent lab tests in a leading PC magazine. I have had to install and remove countless cartridges and NEVER spilled a drop. The pop-in, pop-out design couldn't be easier
I've owned and use the Sony 256MB Memory Stick Pro pictured (in black), and currently also use a 1GB Sony Memory Stick Pro. I've not had any problems with them, formatting or otherwise, over long periods of heavy use. OK, a little pricier than, say, SD cards, but a good quality product for Sony digital cameras.
I have really bad luck with head sets (I dropped a vise on my last set, really)these are really well built headphones, it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad, but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set. They can get very loud and not crack, exceptional base, and mic is very very clear. They are light but feel solid, although I have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong. I have very big ears that is one of the reasons I bought this head set, it is very comfortable. The only thing I don't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups, but maybe it help keep your ears cool, maybe. I really give them 4 1/2 stars. I paid about $90 for them and I have no regrets. So if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the Sony mdr-300/mdr-400 they don't have mics but good headphones.Hope this helped, good luck
The quality of this bag is just great the problem could be the very tiny front bag. It also has a small bag for the AC power cable and transformer but once you use it there is no place to put it comfortably considering a 15" laptop
This armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen (stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector). It works well for jogging and working out. The neoprene (better than leather for sweaty workouts) armband fits well on my upper arm (6' 200lb) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms. It is a bit awkward to silde the nano into the skin while keeping the screen protector in place. I first began sliding the nano into the armband mount but found that difficult to keep the screen protector in place so I now just clip it in which seems to work fine. It has tried to come loose from the armband a couple of times but I think this was due to not ensuring the nano was fully seated into the armband. I have only used the armband for about 3 weeks now and I am satisfied at this point, I am only giving 4 stars due to the screen protector being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included. Also on another note, apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the nano because almost all protectors I have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception. The button is next to the upper left edge and any decent protector has to almost cover this area to work properly. All in all you will be satisfied with the armband and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the nano and a good armband also so it's a solid value.
I bought these for my Zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding, compact headphone for work and working out at the gym.If you are like me and can't stand all the earbuds out there, then you need to find another solution. I tried the Premium Zune buds at 40 bucks, and the Bose Quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks, but they just gave me earaches and I was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight. I read countless reviews of this headphone and I can say this is the best sounding under $40 headphone out there that won't mess with your hair. (Yes, better than even the Bose earbuds!)If you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player, be prepared to be blown away. Tight, full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids. You don't have to crank them either, they sound rich even at lower volumes. But if you do crank them they don't distort at all. If you have ever tried the Bose Quiet comforts at the stores, these sound very similar but with an open air design!The only negative is the comfort. The little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so. I think I'll get used to it. I'd much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs. jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal (which I had). That could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems.Some other reviewers complained about the headband, but it sounds like they were not wearing these right. Once on your noggin, the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head. This keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort. I do not think the headband is too tight, it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place.I might buy a pair of the PX 100's as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading.  The PX 100 is the same exact phone in an "over the head" design. At $40, I can afford to get both
When my CDs started skipping I thought they has seen the last days of spinning, however this Disc Cleaner has solved all problems. You simply put the CD into the cleaner with the label side down. Then, you spray the disc cleaner to the disc surface. You only apply one even spray of cleaner. Then, you close the case and make sure the lid is totally closed. Once you have cranked the movable part of the lid about 5 times, you can remove the disc and let it dry completely. Most of the cleaner was absorbed into the cleaning pad after the recommended 5 rotations. I found that 8 or 9 rotations did the trick. The first time I used this cleaner I was a bit frustrated with it because I noticed little pieces of black foam all over my CDs. Apparently, there is a little piece of foam in the middle that looks like it belongs there and it seems glued down, but once I removed that piece of foam, all was go. This unit comes with one additional cleaning pad. I think if you are just using this to remove fingerprints, you won't have to replace the cleaning pads very often. Handy gadget to prolong disc life and restore performance to contaminated disc surfaces. ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
I purchased 2 for my son and husband. Both rumble and work perfectly with the racing games such as Need for Speed Underground 2, Nascar 2003 and 2004. Some of the early games cannot be used, but they still love it. The wheels actually feel like you are in a race car with realistic resistance. I recommend this item
It works!  The antenna isnt junk either, I am getting almost all the digital stations from chicago 25 miles from sears tower with it inside my house sitting on my desk. I also get many digital channels that happen to be on the comcast analog cable in my area (chicagoland). Problem is that all the analog stations on my comcast cable are untuneable, so I cant watch those on my mac.  Its not supposed to be a cable tuning box, just digital stuff, so its fine, I just thought it did that as well.next thing to do is get a bigger/better antenna mounted outside and cancel cable (as I only watch a couple stations anyways).eyetv - works.cytv with it - works great!  make sure you go and donate to that opensource project
Very easy to assemble, has very classic lines, lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation, hard to find add-on shelf in maple. Holds a lot of equipment
The Apple Airport Card - network adapter - Airport 802.11b was a fabulous purchase.  It did exactly what it was supposed to, was easy to install and test, worked immediately.  The vendor that supplied the airport card was prompt, efficient, courteous, and careful in the packaging.  Very happy with the product
This card is great for the seamless apple look and feel (and only option for internal in imac/ibook/PB) but it is way overpriced now that it is out of production. There are other options. Belkin F5D6050 USB B adapter has drivers for 9.2 and OSX, several manufacturers (e.g. certain Belkin, Linksys, Microsoft) PCI cards have airport extreme chipsets (broadcom) on them that OSX reads as a real airport Xtreme card. You need to do your research and some cards have different chipsets in different revisions, but it is pretty easy overall - and you can save $100
I had been using my air conditioning vents to hold my XM radio and this was recommended to me through a friend.  It's super easy to install and works great.  It doesn't move or shake while driving and is adjustable height wise to fit most car setups.  It was well worth the money and in the summer heat, I am glad I bought it and got my extra air conditioning vent back
Nothing much to report.  They were as advertised and fulfilled my need
The thing that seperates this DVD Case from the rest is it's center lock design. It's secures the disc nicely without damaging it... like I have had others do. Worth the extra dough to have a quality product. (Now if only their memorex's software was as good!
I purchased this USB light/fan combo mainly for the fan.  I'm one of those guys who is a human heater -- always a little warmer than everyone else.  I use this fan when I'm studying in the library, on the computer at a coffee shop or even at home using my laptop at the desk.  It provides a nice little jet of air right at my face which makes me feel cooler all over.  I can even direct it right in front of me and only the nose of the rotor head is visible because when the fan is running, of course, you can see right through the blades.  The fan runs quietly too.  I've had a couple of times when the fan is making a bit of a noise or isn't running a quickly as normal.  I just pop off the rotor head, adjust the blades a bit (they are flexible vinyl and I give them a little twist and a crease to make them more rigid as they sometimes get bent in my carrying case), pop the rotor head back on and it's good as new again.  While I like this product a lot, I doubt with frequent use that it will last much more than a year but I still think it's well worth it.  My only regret is that I didn't order two or three of these for future back-ups if needed.  The light works well too.  It does not illuminate the entire keyboard but in a dark setting it does provide enough illumination for the typical user (a hunt and peck typist may be frustrated but I think it may be enough light for that kind of visibility as well) and definitely enough light to read from a book or hard copy document.
I travel overseas a lot for my job. This little power strip is compact and enables you to keep ONE adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your "normal" plugs for operating four devices. Most Monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money (wires, cables, etc.) but this gizmo rocks
The tapes are exactly what I had searched the web for.  Thanks to Amaxon.com for listing the seler
The Sony STR-DG600 7.1 has worked as expected and is a high-quality system at a great price
I used to buy those cheap $[...] red laser pointers at gun shows and flea markets, just to have some fun, but the batteries didn't last long enough and the beam wasn't bright at all, not to mention that it made more of an oval dot than round.  I bought this one thinking that it would be really cool because it was green.  I thought the high price tag was pushing it just for a little green dot, but it is much more than I thought it would be.  The beam is clearly visible in the dark and you can even see the dot on the blackest street in the middle of a sunny day.  The range is incredible and makes street signs reflect hreen shimmers!  I love it!  A much better buy than those crappy red ones, and the AAA batteries are easy to replace and last much longer
These ear buds provide a VERY good fit.  They block out a lot of external noise.  Much better than my previous ear buds.  The sound is clear with good bass.  Definitely worth the price
We used this remote to program a Sony AV-RM3000 remote, but we need more flexibility for our HTPC.  In hindsight, we should have bought a stand-alone IR unit and something like the Girder software.  Or, maybe just an IR wireless keyboard.This is not a remote for those seeking flexibility, or those who like to customize their media experience.  This is an excellent remote for those who want out-of-the-box usability, and don't want to bother with customization.  It's well-built, and will be exactly what many mainstream users are looking for.Pros:  Comfortable shape, sensible layout, high-quality feel, reasonably compatible with many programsCons:  Doesn't do absolutely everything in every compatible application, only four somewhat-programmable keys with limited option
This Salamander Designs rack is very well made and looks great.  It takes a few hours to assemble, but the result is nicer than most home theater furniture out there.  Unfortunately, Amazon's shipping (via UPS) didn't go so well and the outer box arrived in very bad shape.  I was hoping that the inner box would protect the item, but, alas, one of the two doors was damaged.  I'm now trying to get Amazon to replace the door, but they can only exchange the whole unit.  The shipping box is completely destroyed, so I've been forced to contact the manufacturer directly.  Crossing my fingers..
This TV/Monitor rocks!!  I've been looking for a combo computer monitor and TV that I could use in my office. This LCD does both very well. I'm writing this review with the LNS4696D installed and everything on the screen is very large (what I wanted) even at 1600x1200 and the resolution is far better than I expected!! (hint: sharpen the image and set high energy saving mode)
Also at an awesome price. I am going to buy another one just to keep in case the one I have needs to be replaced
Are they the best no.. Do they impress people who havent hear them before YES!! To me thats the best compliment, they are much more objective listenerswith no preconcived notions. All I ever hear is " Those speakers sound so Good" " I love those cool little speakers" etc. I've played everything from Bach to Dio and they sound very realistic. Subwoofer placement is key to having the proper bass level. At [...] they are a steal.. I paid [...]in 1991 and listen to them everyday they still sound like they did when new.
Outstanding product!  Keeps the laptop cool plus the added benefit of having 4 USB ports
I bought this cooling fan because my computer was shutting off on its own, and the problem seemed to be that the computer was overheating.  While this product hasn't "cured" my computer, the performance of my computer has definitely improved with the use of the cooling fan.  The extra USB ports are convenient as well.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a laptop and wants to keep it from overheating
I am new to this type of device, but it has performed as expected
This is a great radio for sailboats and other boats that do not have a 12v power supply
I bought this because I needed good phones without the extra bulk.  They're really lightweight, but not flimsy.  They have very good sound quality.  I really like the volume control on the headphones themselves. It gives me the extra level of control.  All in all, a really good bang for your buck
Jensen JM10 Anonymous Review I love these headphones!! The easy access volume control is right where I need it and I can turn it ON and OFF whenever I need to. They are a great value! The headphones stay where they are supposed to and fit my head great. The sound quality is clear and crisp. The single cord attached makes it feel as if your not wearing headphones at all. I would recommend it to all my friends
This card worked out of the box on my Linux, Ubuntu 6.10 based system. This Belkin card--at least the version I have-- is based on the Atheros chip set
After reading other reviews i was skeptical of purchasing the dioshield for my IPOD. I had read a lot about how it interefered with the USB cable or the hold switch.  But I couldn't argue with the price.I must say that this product it actualy one of the best aftermarket IPOD products I have puchased.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, Protect My Ipod. I have no trouble opperating any of the IPOD's  buttons and I simply remove the case when I charge the unit.  I have not found that it impairs the functionality of the IPOD at all while keeping it securely around my neck.  It is perfect for Jogging weight training and other outdoor activitites.  I find it much less cumbersome than the armband or belt clip units as it does not impede my range of motion.Ultimately it perfectly protects my IPOD when I am out and about which is what it was designed to do.The reasons I gave it 4 and not 5 stars was the laniard feels a little short not much but a little. and I whished they had mounted the IPOD right side up like they did on the nano model.Over all I am well please
For the price, these speakers are well worth the cost. Of course, in my opinion, anything that dosnt say "Creative" on it is usually worth the price. Not a lot of bass, but with the bass boost, these speakers sound real nice. Only bad thing I'll say is that M-Audio's tech department is really bad. Emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for Vista, still no answer. (my inquiry was about a different m-audio product)
The six commonly used power tips provide flexibility with this product.  I purchased this to use as an interface between a CD Walkman player and the AC power cord.  The heads have specific polarity; so it is possible to attach the heads incorrectly.  However, if you pay attention to the plus and minus hookups as indicated, it's not too difficult to make the attachment correctly the first time.  I found the product to work effectively.  The only negative I can see is that the actual plug-in device is a bit bulky; so if you want to use this in a power strip setting, the AH3WH can be a bit of a plug hog.  However, other than that limitation, the product was reliable.  Recommended to save on those batteries which do add up
I have been putting this television through its paces since I got it a few weeks ago, and it is by far the best TV I have ever owned, and very difficult to beat.  The image quality is really good, with bright, vivid colors and wonderful detail, especially for 1080i/p content, but even lower-resolution 720p content, which is what's more commonly-available on OTA HD broadcast, looks phenomenal.  I also have an Apple TV hooked up to it, and even though most of my content is encoded at either 360p, 480p, or 720p, it still looks quite good.It does take some time to get the image tuned to perfection, and the default settings are way too bright with too much color saturation boost, and the DNIe processing system actually seems to make some motion effects worse.  However, it's very easy to change the settings and see immediately what effect they have.Like all LCDs it does have some slight black point problems; these aren't noticeable for fullscreen 16:9 content, but for older 4:3 content it's pretty obvious that the black isn't pure black.  However, this is again tunable.The only thing I really notice which is pretty annoying is that it doesn't do a very good job of upscaling 480i content, such as the output from most video game systems, and for DVDs to look good you really need an upconverting player since even with a progressive-scan player there is a lot of visible pixelation when the 480p content is scaled up.  It's really more a sad reflection on how the previous "next-generation" video looks downright primitive by today's standards.The other noticeable issue is that unlike many televisions with digital tuners, it doesn't have an on-screen program guide.  My previous TV (also a Samsung) had an on-screen program guide, but it was rather cumbersome to use and took several minutes of scanning every channel to see what was on, and most local channels are pretty inconsistent about providing the EPG information anyway, so it's not really that big of a deal.  You can still see the detailed information for the program that's currently showing, so it makes use of EPG, just not as much as it could.This television's tuner is also quite phenomenal.  My previous TV required a very carefully-positioned powered antenna which was very sensitive to every little nearby fluctuation, while with this one I only have a piece of wire jammed into the antenna port and I get perfect reception of every local digital station.Another nice improvement over Samsung's older HDTVs is that it has a wide variety of zoom modes which allow you to counteract some of the stupider things that TV stations do (for example, pillboxing a letterboxed 16:9 show, which is very common for widescreen non-HD programming).  Also, analog TV stations and source inputs get their audio signals upconverted to digital, so you only need to run a single optical audio connection to your stereo (while previous Samsungs required running both analog and digital cables and switching between the two inputs based on source material).As a PC monitor this is also quite nice.  I have a Mac mini hooked up via SVGA cable, and even with an analog signal it looks perfectly sharp and crystal-clear, and of course you can hook it up via HDMI (with a DVI to HDMI adaptor) as well.  The only gripe there is that the supported resolutions are a bit quaint - at least on analog SVGA the only 16:9 resolution it supports is 1920x1080, which can be difficult for some older systems to handle.  However, on HDMI it should support all the standard HD resolutions.This television may be more expensive than others in its size class, but it also far outshines every other TV I have seen, aside from the newer LN-T4065, which is nearly identical aside from providing a higher dynamic contrast ratio.  If you want to only buy one TV which will last for a long time, it would be hard to go wrong with this one
NOTE: this product will only work on walls with wood studs.  No metal studs.See the sanus website for installation manual and more details
The carry case does the job of holding my Walkman and therefore I say it is worth the money.  However I have found for my smaller arm it is hard to get it wrapped around in a steady position, but with some effort it does.  Overall I am happy with the purchase
I just added this to my Onkyo HTIB system and it's made all the difference in the world. I'm a bit of an audiophile (on a reasonable budget), with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10" Polk in my truck. I'm most satisfied with the Polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess. I listen to a lot of music with double-bass drumming and thought that this PSW12 would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10" sub I like so much. Not the case. What I get is very quick bass with that ground-shaking impact that I always look for.I'm still going easy on 'er for the break-in period, but I can say that the trailer for Kingdom of Heaven (included on the Blu-Ray disc) sounds absolutely stunning. Paired with my 57" Sony HDTV, trips to the movie theater are few and far between these days. Now is a great time to pick up one of these, since the price seems to have recently dropped by about $50 throughout the web.Unbeatable sub for the money!
I use this subwoofer to augment my 7.1 system. It was easy to install, gives excellent response, and I couldn't be more pleased.
The only thing I don't like about it, is the scanning area is upside down where most scanners you open the lid and put your photo or document close to you this scanner you have to put it all the way to the back of the scanner so you have to open the lid all the way. Also the film tray shows on some of my documents as well you would think they would give you something to cover the film tray when not in use. I did like the way XP found this scanner right away with no disks or software. I have a cannon scanner I just got a few months ago but it is limited because it is not compatible with XP with out cannons software, The cannon was so bad that I purchased this one all in all I like it does a great job glad they still make just scanners for people who use laser printers
I liked options and text edit. I really liked the ability to scan into Micsoft Word
This is one of the best products I have spent my money on. This speakers 'speak' well and you will be amazed at how well they sound for that kind of size.Also, the buying experience from Amazon was excellent. I got mine deleivered in about 2 days.Will recommend product for anyone else
You can count on every Monster Cable made. It's worth the extra money over the cheap ones. The gauge of the wire is thicker and the ends are made of better material
I'm a fanatic for duplexing since I move a LOT of paper around, sometimes amounts which I have to carry to court or mail and which weigh several pounds.  The Brother is one of the better machines for the price that handles duplexing well, maybe even the best.  This particular machine has wireless G built-in, but it costs over $100 more than the same machine without wireless, and for well over $100, you can probably manage to do the same thing cheaper, maybe even better, and for my office, wireless is inappropriate.  (It also should be stated that if you go outside Briother itself, then the wireless combo IS cost-effective.  Brother essentially competes here only with itself.)  That said, it makes for an elegant solution in the home if you have any sort of barrier to wiring and would like a single piece of equipment to handle everyone's printing if several of you are running off of a wireless router.  There are a bevy of bonuses if this machine is otherwise appropriate for you.  It's a complete standalone fax/copier if someone in the house doesn't even have any computer at all.  I'm a long-time Brother customer, and they've made operation more intuitive for both computer users and standalone.  There were a few bugs in earlier machines by Brother (comparable but older machines I've owned, like the 8500 and the 9700) such as faulty out-of-toner warnings, and all of these seem to have been worked out.  This machine is clearly out of beta.  Earlier machines were difficult (though not impossible) to set up and use advanced functions without using your manual, and this machine is far better on that aspect as well.  You can have faxes arrive two-sided, which doubles your paper tray effectively, and you can scan or fax a two-sided document just by feeding it in and possibly altering a setting.  This last is made possible by the physical arrangement and just as much by the aforementioned ease-of-use - you wouldn't use the feature much if you had to do major messing around with menus just send out a two-sided page.  Unfortunately, the one bane of all printers which is slightly worse with the Brothers is the "ink" aspect.  Unlike some competitors, you have to replace a toner AND a drum, and at differing intervals. I assume they do this to keep the costs low, but the costs still aren't particularly low.  The non-wireless version of the basic machine sells for a little over $400, and there is no problem spending that much for just a couple of drums and a few toners.  I don't understand why printers of all sorts cannot just have a "gas tank" you could fill with cheap ink and then just add paper, but in most instances, the consumables are the tail wagging the dog in terms of buying a printer.   The Brother is a superbly-functioning modern machine at a great price, but don't imagine the price ends when you buy it.  This is true of all printers, however, and the news with most printers is worse than here
I can't say enough about the Tivoli AM/FM radio!  It has superior sound and i love the design of the case as well.  Some folks might be hesistant to spend over $100 for a radio ... trust me - it is well worth it.  My girlfriend's parents have had an older version of this radio for over 30 years - still sounds great
I would encourage ANYONE in the market for a shredder to first identify WHERE the machine is to be placed! If you want something "cute" and compact, then, keep looking. This SB-97Cs is a work horse, in every sense of the word. Consequently, it may not appeal to one's feminine traits. Although the size can be a bit formidable for home use, it's power and relatively quiet operation set the standard for all others. I was surprised at just how quiet it was! The controls are easy to master, and the safety features are good to have for the occasional inquisitve child. Having had a lessor (un-named) shredder, I knew that my shredding needs were beyond the waste-paper-basket sized machines for less money. Being one who regularly shreds credit card "bait" checks, and other sensitve info that accumulates through the years, this SB-97Cs shredder was a must have. I doubt that I'll outgrow this machine. I've had this shredder for only a couple of months now, and I expect to have it for many years to come. It IS NECESSARY to oil the cutters after each full basket, though. If you are the disciplined and conscientious type, this is not a problem. However, I can see the lifespan of this machine being cut short by the negligent types who don't read instructions..
Simple, but does what it's supposed to.  Allows you to connect the audio output of a laptop/PC/iPod, etc., to the audio input on your TV.
This product has worked great with my 2Wire Gateway modem from AT Yahoo.The real plus has been the USB connection so its not necessary to take off the desktop's back panel. The connection has been good, and I set it up in minutes.I tend to think that people who are having connection problems have a problem with their router, and not this device.  I can see 50%+ networks from all over my neighborhood
This printer does an excellent job. The colors are vivid and the clarity is very crisp. The only negative is you are restricted to the canon paper with end tabs. Good value for a compact snap shot printer
Switch was simple to install to my existing network, just plug and go. I used this switch to separate some CPUs off of the 100mb network and put them on the gig highway. Worked just as planned and was seamless. I actually added two of these and saved big jack over a 16 port gig switch. Network speed and response time increased even for those CPUs w/out a gig nic. I like the idea of having a switch with capacity that far exceeds network traffic. Highly recommend
these cases are amazing!!  i love them!!  if i ever need to replace one of my dvds i always buy Memorex DVD Storage Cases.  there the next best thing, i think to the ones that come orignal with my store bought dvds.thanks Memorex!
This is the only type of speaker cable i use to connect my state of the  art sound system
While the two fans I ordered for a new computer build are functioning properly, they are not as advertised on Amazon's website.  According to the specs on the site, they have a double ball-bearing design which last longer than normal fans. Be warned, these are NOT the Antec double ball-bearing fans, but the less expensive ones.  Have contacted Amazon and hope they update the specs to reflect these accurately
this radar/laser detector is very good detects the police radarand the best is do not  false signals
It does everything promised but takes several hours of going over the instructions to figure out how to program some of the features.  Instructions hard to locate in booklet
I took my MP3 player into the store with me to check out earbuds.Eveyone I tried was terrible; so I ended up buying online.I read all the reviews, especially Amazon reviews; because the people know what they are talking about.I have bought 5 pair altogether for friends, and they love these buds too.The music I listen to ranges from Tupac to Vivaldi, and everything in between. My MP3 player has 9 EQ settings; I keep it on new age most of the time. The price is right, and the sound is the best.
A lot of TV for little money.  Great picture, and the refresh rate is fast enough to prevent most of the blurring that you tend to see on low end LCD's.  Initial setup can be tricky because Olevia chose to include a CD version of the operators manual, though you can print a paper version from the CD or Olevia website.  Better than average sound, but the side speakers add a bit to the overall width.  After tweaking the factory settings we achieved a nice color balance without any of the black level problems that plague many LCD's.  If you're using it in a bedroom you'll most likely be annoyed by the very bright on/off light on the front panel.  Rear panel connections are intuitive and easily accessible, and wall-hanging was a breeze.  Looked at many LCD televisions and there are better choices for sure, but it's hard to beat the performance of this set at the low price. Highly satisfied! 
I had great hope for this product.  It has, mostly, so far, lived up to my expectations.  Here are some caveats...I was hoping for the ability to set up music catagories...easy listening, dinner music, light jazz...etc.  You have to "cheat" to do this, and using the manual is daunting.  Instead of using the "Artist" as artist, I used it as a catagory code, ie making one artist light jazz, etc.  This works, but you do, of course lose the artist registration ability.So now, I can select "artist" "Dinner Music" and then "All Discs" and "Shuffle", and the unit will play a track from one "Dinner Music" CD then shuffle to another track on another "Dinner Music" CD, etc, making a delightful, mix of music that never is repeated exactly the same way.I am still in the loading phase of coexistance with this machine, so longetivty, and flawlessness are not being reviewed here.  That remains to be seen.The manual is purely awfull.  Just dig in and try things.  That's the only way to get a handle on things.  Hope this helps....good luck!
This is a very nice TV for the money. Great picture and with the built in DVD player that plays CD's I was able to remove a big old CRT TV, DVD player and stereo from the bedroom. I'm happy with my choice
I gave this 5 stars only because it serves its purpose well. It's just a basic mouse pad, but the price is excellent!!
I received this printer a few days ago and I am very impressed. 4 X 6 photos look awesome as if I had Walmart print them and the speed is very fast. I hook it up to my Airport Extreme Base Station (I use a Powerbook) and print wirelessly and had no problems at all. Scanner is a tad bit noisy but a lot quieter than my old HP All in one printer that just kicked the bucket.The software is easy to use and understand. I never read the directions and I was scanning in pictures with in minutes. I also like the LCD display on the printer. Its nice to just "pop" in a memory card, and view the photos you want to print. It saves time when you don't have to download them to the computer then print them.Overall I am vey pleased and I did my search on this printer and all of the reviews were very good. I was torn between Canon (I actually bought a Canon Pixma and returned it) and HP and I am glad I stuck with HP, always a trusted brand. And the price was about $40.00 dollars cheaper than any electronics store around.Pros:Excellent picture qualtyFast printingEasy setupA lot of featuresEasy to use and understand functionsCons:Scanner a litte noisy (quieter than my old HP)When printing the printer shakes my table (old HP did the same)I guess it is a little on the large side, but it doesn't bother m
I have just up-graded to a 40" HD samsung 1080p TV so I had to replace my 2 yr old onkyo 601 "great receiver" with this 674 model mainly for the HDMI switching capabilities, set-up was a little tricky but after an hour I was ready to try the audyssey set up mic. which was very straight forward  accurate Boy was I blown away. This thing has such clarity  separation I couldn't believe the difference over my older onk.rec.I have direct TV hd-dvr  Panasonic 1080i DVD player via HDMI through receiver, don't waste your money on those over priced monster cables, all of mine are 15-20 bucks from amazon. I am so pleased with my purchase I also feel this is a great value 599.00 I know their is not a better receiver out there at this price or even for 200.00 more. I would highly recommend this as the backbone to any quality home theater system. I read another review that expressed that you couldn't turn it up past 60,that is false I can crank mine up to max with with vertually no distortion
I recently purchased the Pacific Breeze Laptop Cooler and so far am very impressed with it.  Now this review should be taken with a grain of salt, because I have only had the cooler for a few weeks, but I feel that the results were evident immediately and the build does seem adequate.  The reason that I was in search of a cooler was due to my dangerously hot hard drive temps.  I installed Notebook Hardware Control (free temperature and power control utility) after feeling how hot my new notebook was getting and saw temps as high as 55C at my hard drive!  Worried about how this would affect the hard drive's longevity, I started looking around at coolers.I choose this cooler after reviewing several of the "mat" variety, but chose this one because of its design.  As the previous reviewers have already mentioned, this cooler elevates the notebook from the rear and blows air under the notebook.  This allows the CPU fan intake and hard drive to receive plenty of fresh air.After setting this cooler up, I was feeling pretty good about the purchase.  Qualitatively, the results are evident by a cooler notebook top and keypad, and the feel of air exiting the sides of the notebook.  Quantitatively, the notebook experienced a 5C temperature drop at my HD and at my CPU.  Now my hard drive is running at 40C-45C instead of 45-50C!I would definitely recommend this product
Unlike the first reviewer my experience with Trigger Finer has been a good one. At first it took me awhile to figure out how to get the device to control the drums in Impulse (Ableton Live) once I realized that each pad had to be set in order to have each tone mapped it was a breeeze. I suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as M Audio states....it is program and play, however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless. The htinkg is it is soo expandable and programmable it may be to its own detriment especaiily for peolle who are not fimiliar with mapping out midi controllers
I just love the color, the stile  and the price.It is a perfect player.     Thank you.
for the money, I got a good quality product. My purchase experience was good, and product was received in a timely manner
I bought this cable half minded reading the other reviews and i was bit worried whether it will work. When i hooked up the cable between my laptop and TV, wow.... this is really worth a buy.
We received this item very quickly.  It was exactly what we ordere
Umm. This is ink. Not much to say other than it works fine with my Epson R320 Printer
We looked at many TV stands to go with the Sony TV we were buying.  Only a few were worth considering, but finally decided to go with the Sony unit designed for our specific TV.  Am I glad we did!  It has hold downs to secure the TV and the cable straps at the rear are easy to use and make the installation clean and clear.  Very nicely designed, along with being good looking
Great joystick! I didn't think I could find any better than my Sidewinder, but I was wrong! Very configurable and smooth
This memory card works great with my 15" PowerMac laptop.  I've had a noticeable increase in speed with no hitches. 
No problem whatsoever with this product.  It was delivered in a timely manner and worked perfectly
I've never tried verbatim media, since there were 5inch computer floppy disc (circa 1983-85).  I pleased to find that verbatim still makes a quality product
I've seen others coaster from day 1 and I've seen others coaster after day 60 (after an actual succesfull write!) but these are absolutely awesome. Highly reliable ... long-term
Wow, I'm surprised by the reviews made here about this product. Despite the bad reviews, I bought it anyway.  I still believe in a Motorola.  Guess what?  Not bad.  I bought this phone set and 4 of its satellites to replace my Siemens.  The Siemens was the best phone when it first came out about 5 years ago.  This Moto phone has the features most people will ever need.  The shared phonebook is very valuable.  A loud speakerphone on each handset is priceless.  Incoming and outgoing sound quality is excellent.  I don't understand why there are several reviews here stating the phone has bad sound quality.  Ok, the range is not as good as my 2.4ghz phone but it is not bad for someone with an average size home.  After about 75 meters with 3 walls in between, I can start to hear the voice I'm speaking to, crackles.  I just did this for test but I can get clear voice anywhere in my 4 bedroom house.  I am running a 2ghz wi-fi and do not hear any interference. With regard to the phonebook, I wish I can enter more characters each address!  The maximum characters I can enter is only 11.  I think I can enter about 20 on my Siemens.  Another minor quirk is when someone called, I could just lift the phone off its charging base and start talking to the other party.  Not with this phone.  I still have to press the "flash" bottom everytime before I can start talking.  Build quality is excellent.  It is a little on the heavy side which I like probably because it uses 4 rechargeable batteries and made of thick plastic.  Even if I squeeze the handset hard, I didn't hear that plasticky noise and feeling of the plastic warping.  I tried the Pana, V-Tech, Uniden, GE, and ATT in a local store and the Motorola is tops. You will not see a rubbery wiggly buttons here.  I personally think this is the best phone among the few remaining brands around.  If you do not see it that way, it must be a quality defect that can happen on any product.
I'm so happy with these speakers. For the price, the sound is utterly amazing. I have a good moderately priced system, and these speakers really make it special. No one can believe the crystal highs or the big bass coming from such  humble-looking speakers
This radio has excellent features for someone who is either new to shortwave radio or just wanting a simple, user-friendly set of controls.  Also perfect for those that like analogue-style controls that would be encountered on older radios.  I have the S-350, the model that the S-350DL replaces.  For general world band programme listening, this radio is fantastic.  Outstanding speaker.  Easy to read digital display includes backlight.  Includes attenuator.  Clock can be set to 24 hour time.  Easy to carry anywhere.  Robust antenna.  Does not support SSB tuning, which you would need to tune in Ham radio.  Same radio sold under Tescun name in other parts of the world
I don't know what was wrong w/ the other reviewers machine, but let me assure you, this is NOT an inferior product. I got it on Clearance @ Target for $69.98. I have been looking for a long time for a good portable DVD player. I have used it and had NO problems with it whatsoever. Plus if anything does happen in the first 90 it is fully returnable to Target. Good Deal all around. Highly reccomended.
Below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks.Pros:-----1. Amazing sound especially when watching DVD movies2. Very good progessive scan DVD picture quality3. Simple, compact and all-in-one design4. Remote control can work with various TV's, Cable boxes and VCR's5. Can play both NTSC and PAL DVD'sCons:-----1. Expensive2. No HDMI output3. Non-intuative remote control4. No headphone jackOverall, I love and chose the Bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design. I got this system because I wanted a compact all-in-one media center and I was not interested in getting a HTIB with 5 speakers. I looked at Denon (2 products), Sony and Samsung.I use this on my 23" Samsung LCD TV using Monster component video cables and while I would have preferred to take advatange of its HDMI capabilties, the reality is that I am very happy with this image quality. Movies such as Lord of the Rings, The Matrix and Hero look and sound fantastic. Prior to this I was looking at the Sony DAV-X1 which is much cheaper and more feature-rich. However the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me. For example, my PAL DVDs cannot be played on the Sony whereas on the Bose it was no problem. I am of the opinion that Sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products.To be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their TrueSpace 2.1 surround sound feature. My couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me. According to Bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the TV. Sometimes TrueSpace works and sometimes I can't hear it. I believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other. If surround sound is really that important to you, then you should get a 5.1 system. This product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3D sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec-room.The audio quality from music CD's is very good and while I wish this had an iPod port as found on the Denon, I am very content using the Aux port
     My [...] girl and [...] boy both love their players. The [...]really likes the Sonic games and the ability to connect it to the TV. On a TV the 8 bit graphics are jagged but he does not care and the games are playable. The builtin screens are a little low in resolution if you look closely but cartoons look good and the kids have not noticed anything.      The players have a nice lock feature to disable the controls so that the movie is not accidentally stopped. They have both dropped the players serveral times and they both continue to work well. The only problem is that the [...] had figured out how to remove the battery pack. She does this at times then gets upset the movie stopped.     The players come with everything, AC and auto adapters, a remote control, earphones, built-in stand, battery pack and the wires to play the movies and the games directly on an a TV with RCA jacks
This product is good. I haven't seen any issues with this so far...
Mouse is comfortable to use, and I haven't had any problems with it so far.  I did have some difficulty hooking it up to my computer, but once I figured out the problem it was all smooth sailing from there.  It is my first wireless mouse, so I have nothing else to compare it to, but i definitely like it a lot better than my old mouse. 
I needed this cable to use with my Garmin Rino 120 because my new laptop didn't have a serial adapter. My first try was to use a similiar product from Radio Shack, but I found the Radio Shack product was very confusing to use and was unstable.  I ordered the CP Technologie product from Amazon and it worked great! Also, the CP Tech product was less than half the cost of the Radio Shack product (including shipping)
I tried many other adapters and this was the only one that worked for my PDA
This Wall Mount works and hold's great. I used it for an Olevia 542I LCD Flat Panel and have had no problems. The instructions are not all that clear, but it is not hard to figure out how to instal
I wanted a simple printer so I could print a few prints from time to time to hand out. On sale for $50, this seemed like the right one. I already had the included Zoombrowser and Photo Stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a Canon A95 camera, so I just needed to install the driver. Note this requires a USB cable (not included) to the printer.As is human nature, I tried to print without reading the Zoombrowser instructions, and got a lovely plain sky-blue print with the words "My Album" on it - but no photo :-) Then, out came a stunning second print which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines - this was from a residual click from my first attempt. Ok, Ok, so I looked at the PDF printing guide for about 15 seconds, and followed the instructions.Got a beautiful first print of the Queen Mary ship. Got a gorgeous second print of flags (red/white/blue, and green) againt a clear blue sky, and the third print was very nice of a field of flowers near Mt Lassen (ironically the original proof print of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper prints...)So, I've blown through the provided "trial" 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge, and have 3 very nice prints (with postcard address lines, stamp area and Canon logo on the back - the paper comes that way.) The ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1/2 inch from the end so you can remove them after printing.I can't compare the printing software to any other brand, but setting up a plain photo-only print takes about 10 seconds of menu choices. If you want to add backgounds, titles/text, etc, that is available as well. (Got another pack of paper/film, and put humorous captions on kind of funny-bad office Christmas pix...)Printing directly from my A95 takes about the same time as from the computer - about 1 min 45 sec.The actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the printer 4 times (3 color passes and a protective layer) so it is important the back of the printer is not obstructed, particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot. The finished print is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front.  The unit looks and feels substantial for its small size, comes well packed (survived NY to CA shipping), has decent documentation, and a 1-year warranty.
Every house should have a Grundig S350 Deluxe. Big, brawny, "grabbing" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business, the Grundig S350 Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig S350, eliminating some of the "drift" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin, the Grundig S350 DL has depth. Is it a perfect radio? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Superradio boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM.If you're looking for a radio with similar features as the Grundig S350 DL but erases its weakness--no presets and AM overload, then you might want to check out the Grundig G4000A. It's the same price as the S350 and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave radio. Or you might look at the stunning Kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the Eton E5. But even if you get a fancy preset radio, every house should have the big easy-to-use Grundig S350 Deluxe.Update: Comparing the S350 to the same-priced G4000 for several months, it becomes clear that the G4000 is a better buy: superior AM, superior separation of AM stations, presets, same warm speaker, and smaller.
These folks continue to amaze me with their advancement of the state of the art in memory, and Amazon purchase and delivery is so dependable it's like money in the bank.  I hope no one comes in and tries to "improve" things.
I must admit I read many other reviews of this item and was a little apprehensive, however... .  I found this recorder to be outstanding in all the items I've tried so far. I initially just hooked it up like my old one was and left it for a few hours after manually setting the time (before reading the instructions) . This made things more difficult so I started over, set it for everything to be automatic, including the time, left it until the next evening and allowed it to do its' thing - which it did magnificently. EVERYTHING worked beautifully and it did a great job. I LOVE the one-touch recording. I found it's best to read directions one at a time as I want to try something new and have had no problems. So far I haven't tried everything it will do but find it's very intuitive and not a bit frustrating to use. It's a joy to hit the TVGuide button, highlight the shows I want to watch and hit the record button. So far I have no complaints
Great new product!  Easy to use and turns my audio ipod into a portable media player.  I can even use it to record my favorite tv shows.  I highly recommend this product
For this price these are a steal! Purchased mine for $15 (with shipping) and let me tell you, it was worth it! The headphones come with a 1/4 converter too! So you can use them for cd players and amps! The sound quality is good, and the headphones don't hurt half as much as other ones after wearing for several hours. These are an amazing deal for the price, I'm honestly surprised these arn't marked for $50. Don't pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones
I live in an apartment building and play ( well, practice is a better word ) the bass guitar and needed headphones so I wouldn't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs TV about 6 feet from where I sit and play.The 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing, so I wouldn't have to use an extention cable ( and usualy end up with feedback/distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable)The volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so I don't have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings I like to use when not using headphones.  Makes it real nice too when using an instructional CD or DVD i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head.Very light weight.  Some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them 'bobble heads'.  Fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere.  Cord enters headphones on the left ear side, so you don't have to deal with the classic 'Y' split cord.  Easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way.Earpices fit nicly over my ears (no pinching, gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear) and does a very nice job blocking out noise ( when my wife is awake she watchs the TV, rather loudly, which is right next to me and I bairly notice it). Plenty of padding around the ear pieces.   Many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear, but these headphones I honestly don't feel anything against my ears.  Even after several hours of use each night.Sound quality.  Bose or pioneer they are not, but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn't be shopping in the $20 and under headphones :)That being said they are very good for sound.  Sounded very good on a portable CD player.Only drawbacks I can see is that a person with large/tall ears won't get thier ears covered by the earpads.  The inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1/4 inchs tall by 1 3/4.  IMO they could have been made bigger.Also, if you have a tall head ( good distance from top of head to ear ) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears.I have a head like Drew Carry ( give you an idea head size/shape I'm talking about) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they wouldn't have fit.I wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don't interfere, bind, pinch or anything like that with my glasses.So, I highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after( I don't recomend things often :) )    
when i opened my package i was a little disappoined with this product but after using it for a while i learned to like it. it is easy to use the front controls with the inno but akward to turn on and off. overall a nice case. shoped around and found amazon had best price with free shipping. received in about one week
Still embarking on spooling off all the Hi-8 tapes I have, but I've been VERY satisfied with the Plextor unit so far.  First thing I did was to spool one Hi-8 tape and then make a DVD, using the functionality of the bundled WinDVD Creator software.  Good news: it worked, and a few hours after I started, I was watching the DVD I created, on my bedroom DVD player.  Bad news: the software is full of minor and sometimes more than minor annoyances.  It may be that I'm still climbing the learning curve with it, but I think it's just not very good.  I'm looking into other solutions, such as Pinnacle, Adobe Premiere Elements, etc.  Meanwhile, I keep spooling.I haven't yet tried the TV capture in any depth.  It looked like it worked, but again, with some annoyances on the software side.  Plextor could improve this offering vastly with the addition of some better bundled software
I bought these for some Sony surround sound speakers, although I was initially concerned about the choice because they are made from what is(essentially) plastic.  However, they turned out to be very sturdy, and easy to install.  I also have to commend the mannufacturer for including very detailed instructions as well as a large selection of mounting hardware.  Well worth the price
Popped it in, works like a charm. Hardest part is opening the packaging, but other than that no worries
"My husband and I bought this for our new home and we're both thrilled!  He loves that it holds our new TV and stereo system, and I love the way it looks. It's extremely sturdy and he was able to put it together in less than a couple of hours. We're so glad we found something we could both agree on!  What a great piece of furniture!
They are good for the price. They have a very good sound quality, or at least better than the ones that came with my Sony Walkman DEJ001. The only problem I had is when I connected them to my older Philips player, it had a low volume output. And then again, even on the Sony player, I had to have the volume at 7, and it only goes to 9. If you have a high output player or a computer, these will be great, but if your using them for a low output or old device, these probably won't cut the cheese
Easy to mount on the wall. Though this item came with hardware with different sizes, I still had to buy some hardware with different length than what they supplied. This mount perfectly suited for my 46" Sony LCD flat panel. In about 30 min, I could mount TV on this bracket.
seems to be good quality. has a strong rubber scent, and no cutouts for the 4 small buttons though
The reviewer below identifying himself as "An Electronics Fan" obviously has a deep bias against Bose.  His multiple reviews about Bose products--here and elsewhere--are transparently motivated by some animus against Bose.  Was he fired by Bose? Did a member of the Bose family reject his romantic advances?  Did a Bose executive accidentally run over his cat?  Did he drop a Bose speaker on his foot and hurt his toe? The true motivation for this guy's negative reviews would be fun to know.  In the meantime, what we do know is that he has no credibility, and his reviews (two here, others elsewhere for other Bose products; he's made maligning Bose his life's work, apparently)) should disregarded.I bought a set of black 301's several years ago to go with my Onkyo receiver.  We have it hooked up to a television and DVD player for movies.  These speakers are in constant use both for the DVD and for music of all types.  The room in which they are placed is huge, with an 18 foot-high flat ceiling.  The speakers saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day. The speakers work fine for spoken audio for DVD's; we can hear dialogue perfectly; I feel no particular need for a surround-sound system. Several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto. I feared a ruptured speaker cone, but the 301's are very forgiving, no damage has been done. The cats sleep on the speakers; they clean right up and still look new after five years.  These speakers keep on giving total satisfaction, and I quite simply love them.About three years ago I decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market, or at least what I determined to be best after a lot of research. This included a set of the gold-series tower speakers from Monitor Audio. (The speaker cones are metallic, with some amount of gold, and gold connections, etc., etc.) These Monitor Audios have to be the best looking speakers ever made (real wood veneer cabinetry, with the gold cones and the black covers, etc.). These speakers cost well over a thousand dollars each.  Well, I must confess, as awesome as the Monitor Audios sound, I can't really say they sound any better than the Bose 301's!!! They can maybe handle more power, but I assure you the Bose 301's will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less.So, when I recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom, I looked forward to buying a third type of speakers.  I ran around and listened to what I could find on display.  Well, after much contemplation, I went for a second set of the Bose 301's!!!  They just couldn't be beat, and I would have gladly spent more if I had found something I liked better. But I'm not going to spend more just so I can say I spent a lot...there has to be increased performance. And, in my opinion, the 301's couldn't be out-performed by any other bookshelf speaker of any price range. My first set of 301's were black.  This time I went for the cherry. Folks, these are absolutely beautiful speakers: almost as cool looking as my Monitor Audios.  The black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood. No, it is not real wood, but it looks very nice.  These things are simply gorgeous. The kind of "mod" or futuristic shape which Bose has designed really stands out in this lighter-colored version.  And, yes, they sound just as good as my original pair.  I listen to soft music (jazz, typically, or ambient) in the morning and these speakers deliver all the nuances at very low volume; I listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions, and the 301's don't scare away or distort at all: these things would tear the house apart before they'd lose sound quality.So, yes, I recommend these highly.  They'd still be the speaker of choice for me at three or four times the price
I have two iPods that don't work.  I bought a shuffle first and that has an error that I can't fix and Apple can't fix.  So, I thought I'd buy 1GB iPod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer.  So, this time I made the right decision and bought the 30 GB Zune.  Wow!  The Zune is so much better!  It has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely, instead of making you frustrated like the iPod.  The screen is perfect.  Sound quality is excellent.  5 Stars for the Zune. 
I liked this charger so much that I ended up ordering a second unit. Premium solid performance in addition to 3 years warranty! I called Lenmar company since the fan on the second charger did not work out of the box but guess what, they sent me another charger without hussle! The call took about 2 minute and the replacement part was already on its way, they definetly stand by and back up their warranty. No problems with the second unit and If I ever need another one I would still buy a lenmar. The two middle charging slots supposed to work only on lenmar PPRO-H batteries, one can use the slot number 1 and 4 for regular NiMH batteries, it charges regular high capacity batteries to an 80% level in less than 15 minutes, and the other PPRO-H batteries in about 7-8 minutes. I didn't notice difference between my rechargeable energizer batteries and the the PPRO-H batteries, but the PPRO-H kind are more durable. This charger is the best in its category because it support worldwide voltage 110-240 V and the first to use NeoTherm charging technology! it's solid and heavy duty charger, not like the cheap kind that are everywhere. I went through lots of sony chargers but you know what? They will never see my money again! the sony chargers are crappy and fry a lot, I have been using the MSC815 since October 2005 almost daily and never once I had an issue with it
I don't bother charging my Zune from the computer any more. This is the only way to go
This is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl's room! The picture is great and Hello Kitty pops on screen for certain commands (volume, channel change..). My daughter age 4 loves it. I would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks...the remote control is has SO many buttons and they are VERY tiny, very close together. I can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also VERY tiny. This is annoying when in my daughter's darkened room and I have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button... the other thing I have to point out that bugs me is that you can't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode. In other words when I go to put in a dvd, I can't just push "open". Nothing will happen. You have to find the right button, choose "dvd" from a choice of 3-4 things, and only then will the tray slide open. All in all, these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again...although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize... One great thing I want to point out--there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards (something not all dvd players offer) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads....you can FF right to the beginning of the movie!!!    
I love the feel of this gamepad...after trying several others this is the best. The wireless works ok, i was 20 feet away and it was working.The batteries are what needs improving according to many posts. I thought i had a dead battery but it ended up being a bad connection inside. With a small screwdriver pushed up through the bottom can take apart the battery case. on the positive side of each battery there are two small pieces of plastic. you just need to push these down so the battery has a better chance of connectiing. i also found new batteris at interstate battery store, 1 dollar each. The analog sticks could be a little tighter, but i like the d pad. wireless is great
This compact mini was exactly what we needed to use as a server for our photography studio. All computers can pull from it with no noticible slow down. It was the smoothest install and network to our 6 computers. I will buy another very soon to use as a backup to the first
Garmin has great ideas that suffer from the company they belong to.  This option is a great thing to add to your 305 if you spin indoors or want to increase the accuracy of the GPS.  NOW if only the software was smart about how and when to use the Sensor ...
This Sharp electronic dictionary is the perfect pocket companion for those times when you don't have your laptop, or a dictionary handy.  The interface is intuitive and the keyboard is amongst the best I've ever used on this type of device.  Moreover, the access times for Dictionary and Thesaurus lookups are very fast; the "phrase search" function is a little bit slower, but not intolerable.  There are also "crossword puzzle" and "anagram solver" functions that I have not used, but I imagine work fine.  Another positive for this product is the fact that it uses a single AAA battery, not some watch-type cell battery.The only negative is that it does not have a backlight for the screen, but neither do many of the other comparable dictionaries.  Hopefully Sharp will smarten up and put that in a future version of the PW-E550.  I believe this is BY FAR the best electronic dictionary you can get for less than $100, and no, I do not work for Sharp Electronics
Our Oskar Multimedia Storage Cabinet arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition. My husband assembled the unit with ease, until it was time to nail the card board backing on. Following the instructions he laid the unit down on it's face, of course the kick-board had already been added so it didn't lay flat. When nailing on the backing the "J" board (the center shelf holding the entire unit together) split at every point of contact.We had ordered our Oskar Storage Cabinet through Amazon, directly from Ritz Camera. So, naturally I called Ritz to replace the "J" shelf. I was informed I would have to return the entire unit. I immediately pictured myself trying to get all those shelves back into the box and figured that was more trouble than I wanted to go through.So, I tracked down the number for Oskar and called them directly. They were very efficient and helpful. Within minutes I had their assurance that they would ship a new "J" shelf to my home - at no additional charge. The shelf arrived within the promised ten-days.This unit was exactly what we ordered and works well for it's intended purpose. I would caution you to be very careful nailing on the backboard, so as not to split the center shelf. My favorite feature of the Oskar Multimedia Wood Storage Cabinet is that they include plenty of extra shelves, unlike so many other brands. I have an entire stack of shelves that I can add as needed. I would love to have three or four more of these units.
I used this recorder alot, I have alot of classes,and the playback is good, it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you haven't listened yet you can move to the next folder and record.  The sound quality is good, 36h record time which can be broken up to folders.  The only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume, i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low,and that goes vice versa as well,. Nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons
This is about the only mouse I buy, have gone through a couple of them in the past few years.  I just can't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out.  This model is one that I find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using.  If you want a good, reliable, comfortable mouse, this logitech is a good choice
This is a great product for those who probably don't write too much. As an engineering student, I found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable - however, it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class. Plus, It would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally
This has been the best investment I've made for quite some time.  After experiencing the black out after the earthquake that hit Hawaii last year and having my computer die, I invested into this unit.  I read a few reviews from various sites that said there was issues with it and that often times it came broken.  I thought to myself the good reviews outweigh the bad so I'm going to try it and see.  Sure enough this unit came with no problems.  I plugged it in and let it charge over night.  I then added my computer and my monitor to it.  I've seen it kick in while the lights dimmed at my home and I'm so thankful that it has saved my computer.  If anything everyone should invest in one of these for their computers.  I fix computers for a living and more often than not people bring in their dead computers due to a power outage or power surge
This item is BR1500, which also called RS model vs. the BX1500 called XS models.  External battery BR24BP can be used for both BR1500 and BX1500.  The capability to connect external battery is great, since that can help reduce the downtime when California experiencing "rolling black" in the summer.There are basically 2 differences between the Back-UPS RS(BR1500) and the Back-UPS XS (BX1500) models besides their names.1. The Back-UPS RS models have both 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem data-line protection and 10/100base-T ethernet protection, where as the Back-UPS XS models only has 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem protection.2. The Back-UPS RS models have both Boost* and Trim** as features of Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR), where as the Back-UPS XS only has Boost. When the input voltage increases above the high transfer point of a Back-UPS XS model it will only go to battery.*AVR Boost: The UPS is compensating for a low utility voltage. While the UPS can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the UPS, the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently low.**AVR Trim: The UPS is compensating for a high utility voltage. While the UPS can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the UPS, the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently high. BX1500 does not have the AVR trim feature, when AC line voltage is higher than spec, it will switch over the battery power till the line voltage drops into the spec range.Please note this is called "backup UPS", not the "smart UPS" line.  Backup UPS does not produce pure sine wave. When power lost, it will take some milli-seconds to switch over to battery power.  "Smart-UPS" produces sine wave and the output AC was from DC source all the time. When AC input lost, the AC output will not have any interrupt.For most computers, the "backup-UPS" is good enough, since the power supply inside PC always have capacitors that can hold for about 100MS or longer. When "backup-UPS" switched over in about 20MS, the computer will continue operates without much impact.  But for A/V equipment, this may be an issue, especially the output is not pure sine wave.  I would not recommend use this UPS for A/V equipment
This is truly the best WIFI you can get on the market right now. Its lightning fast its 4 machines put into 1. Most importantly I've had the best gaming experience ever. Now i can host games on Xbox live without lagging the rest of my teammates and that is no fun. The Linksys WRT330N Wireless-N Gigabit Gaming Router is well worth its money and a great investment. I recommend it highly to anyone that needs a great WIFI for whatever reason
I already have two of these for my heavy rear bose speakers. The speakers are about are about 10 lbs each and are easily handled.The mounts are solid, and can be oriented in any direction easily. I am about to by three more for my center, and two fronts.I highly recommend
I have an Explorist 210 and this bracket fits it like a glove.  Good sturdy bracket, uni-directional, with strong suction cups - installed over a month ago and still has not come loose from windshield.  Great product for the money (in my case $30.76 + free shipping).  Purchased a second one for my other vehicle.
This product is really what I expected it to be. It has a very clear display with a high resolution for a 4 inch screen. The stereo sound is really good. And it has a long lasting battery. Buttons are easy to use. I tried recording from the television, and it is also satisfying. I had no problem about any divx or xvid video type. I really enjoy watching films with cowon a2.
i am so satisfied with this product that i had to come back and write a review on this. it has good picture quality and sound quality is amazing! battery lasts very long which is very very useful n important feature for portable players. I love to watch movies on this and also love to connect this to my TV and watch on a big screen any place i go
I did a bunch of research before i bought the a2. The things that sold me on it were :        1. Battery life.        2. It's got a voice recorder  encodes direct to MP3        3. I love the fact that it's "folder view" , all my music on my PC is   organized by Artist then Album anyway, so it's just copy and paste to get it onto the a2.Which leads to.................        4. Just copy mp3's  avi's on there like a removable USB drive.        5. A/V out to TV is cool.        6. A/V in to record video is a nice extra.So far it's played every avi i've thrown at it. I've got 15GB of music on there and just let it random play the whole lot I use the a2 mostly when driving. I got a nice FM transmitter that powers off the cig socket, sound quality is pretty good. Only problem i have is that i have to carry the a2 in the house at night for fear of it getting stolen out of the car !I also invested in the silicon cover from zcover-it comes with a plastic screen protector and is perfect for when my 2 yr old wants to watch one of his movies on there (the a2 makes for a great pacifier !)Mine came with the latest firmware on there so there was no need to upgrade.I'm very happy with the a2 and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for am honest to goodness media player and has no need for subscription services or any other force fed crap.        
Works great out of the box. Some reviews mentioned problems with the CD but mine worked fine but took some time to start on the first try.  It mounted easly under the upper kitchen cabinet.  No problem with signal strength happy to say since the unit it replaced had problems.  The brightness of the digital clock is adjustiable and I use it as a night light in the kitchen.  The remote control is powerful enough to control the unit from accross the room and adheres to the refrigerater (magnet) with my wife useing it to hang things.  This is a Thomson Inc product (purchased the GE  RCA names several years ago) that makes TV's ect.I am very happy with the product and recommend it
i've used allot of different adapters but this one is got to be the best ever. the Linksys WPC54GX4 work with all routers,but when you pair it up with the Linksys WRT54GX4 router look out, my range increased and i'm getting upwards of 250mb of speed, setup is also a breeze
I purchased this dehumidifier to tackle my overly-humid house.  I live in California, but my house is naturally very humid (around 75% on average).  The humidity frequently gets up to around 80% and above in the winter as verified with a hygrometer.  Mold was fast becoming a problem.  I have used this dehumidifier for over two weeks now, and it is scary how well it works!  I placed it in the bedroom were the hummidity was at it's highest, and it lowered my 15'x15' room from 75% to 50% in less than three hours!It has a quiet fan that I have no problem sleeping with.  The tank is easy to empty and it is light enough to move from room to room.I have not owned any other dehumidifiers before, so I have no basis of comparison, but I am in love with this one!  It was completely worth the price
I bought it in Feb 2006, never had any problem. Occasionally it stops working and just restarting both the units (sender and receiver) fixes the problem. I am so satisfied I am buying another pair
This has got to be the easiest piece of tech I have ever set up. Except for charging, it took under 5 minutes. It works as advertised. I use SkypeIn and SkypeOut. My phone bill is now $68 a year instead of $384. I also get voice mail for free with the SkypeIn. Call quality seems as good as Ma Bell. I was concerned with it being made by Netgear, as I have had spotty luck with their products. I liked this phone so much, I just purchase another handset(It can support up to 4). This phone will pay for itself in a few months
Im not a professional keyboard player. I bought this keyboard to have something to play around in with reason and Guitar Pro.  It suits those needs great.  Its detects right away and withing minutes you will be playing. The keyboard itself is extremly small reminds me of a kids toy keyboard.  If your looking for something more professional you will probably have to fork out the $100 bucks and get the bigger model. 
This is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference. But to see the beam (not just the dot at the end of the beam) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of. Using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out. And if you are wondering, no matter how bright your laser is, without particles in the air you wont see the beam. At concerts where they use the big argon lasers, they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of
Although I prefer the AKG K701 for most of my listening, this competing entry from Beyer is so close that it's almost a coin toss. (One recent comparison in a headphone artcle came up with a dead heat.) This is surprising, considering that the DT880 is one of the most reasonably priced of the major mid-priced headphones. The bass is full but nicely textured - not a touch of bass bloat to be found here. The highs are detaied and never seemed sharp to me, and the overall sound offers a huge soundstage. Instead of the music being on top of your, these Beyers lend a perceived distance of a few feet; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant, and surprisingly makes rock music grandiose in an appealing kind of way. These headphones don't require a headphone amp, but certainly profit from one. The 30 ohm version makes for more volume, though the 250 ohm version is standard, and best for most daily listening. The DT880 sounds great, but lacks a tad of the K701's high-end sparkle. Conversely, Beyer's value, comfort, and workmanship can't help but impress. This is a phone that has labored under the shadow of the AKGs and the Senn 650s, but listeners are always impressed by the DT880s sound. It may be your best value in a mid-priced, all-purpose headphone
This has a nice size screen. It only has 3 buttons.Play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it. I was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button. I just found this out by trial. There was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital. This would only last a second or two. At first I thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them. The volume control is on the side, as well as the power button. It could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me
Very good product. Small, easy to store. Well worth the very reasonable price
Great invention to those who don't want to be attached to an IPOD, and like an updated version of a "juke box". Easy to use, load, unfortunately however, it requires an receiving unit to broadcast the sound
I'm not any expert in the computer world. But this product it is very easy to install. The range is very strong.I'm very hapy with this product!!!
I have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises, but it works nonetheless, and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house, I figure I ought to be grateful that it works at all. I do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections, but I suspect it's related to where I have things in the house, no so much the product. In fact, I can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up. Install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine. It's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed. Can't complain, especially for the price
I bought a ZEN 30G MP3 player and could not stand the earbuds they came with. They hurt so much that I used head phones until these V-MODA earbuds came in. They are awesome.  The fit is so comfortable and the sound it wonderful. I got them on sale for less than they are running right now on Amazon, so I feel pretty good about the purchase.  =
Being that the TV reception coming out of my VCR is always crappy, the first thing I did after getting my Monster Cable SV1/100-M A/V cable (to test is out) was plug one end it into my cable box's A/V output jack, then plug the other end into one of my VCR's A/V input jacks.  The result?  The TV reception coming through the VCR wasn't crappy anymore!!I ended up getting two of these A/V cables to hook up my Sony DVD player to my TV via a Terk VS-4 switch.  The picture is phenomenal!!  I plan to get two more soon to improve the reception from my VCR  my cable box.  These A/V cable are worth EVERY penny that you spend on them!!  You can't go wrong with Monster Cable!
This is a great card for a laptop, however they need to correct their problems with the installer for XP. Also to get thru to them for any help is a major challenge, took me 4 days to get thru on their 800 line. Once you do get to them they fix the problem right away, seems they know it will not install correctly. Then it works great
The product description is incorrect, USB 2.0 works fine on the newer Macs that have such ports. It's overpriced; buy a gently-used one
I use this bag to carry my HP NC6000 business notebook. I have received many complements on this bag
This is a great product for a busy professional or grad student who gives their Mac a lot of mileage.  I'm in law school, so I'm constantly throwing my computer in my bag along with heavy casebooks, keys, and other junk.  My old iBook survived tremendous abuse, and after two years looked like it had been through a war.  The Speck case protects the MacBook's shell and even the screen, in a roundabout way.  Normally, if you put a Mac into a briefcase or bag with heavy books, the books will press against the shell, and the screen inside will press against the keys leaving dents and screwing the the LCD.  The Speck case is very stiff, so even the heaviest books and the worst abuse don't push the screen onto the keyboard.  Plus, if you put a red case on a white Mac, people will think you're in some secret club that has access to red Macs.Cons: it's next to impossible to remove the top case with two hands - you need a buddy to get it off.  Also, dust starts to collect under the bottom case (static?), so you need to take off the bottom monthly to clean.  Fortunately the bottom case is easier to remove for cleaning. 
I am using this bag for school in which I need to carry 4 textbooks, a laptop (15.4 inch screen) and a couple of notebooks.  The pack has plenty of room for these items and still a couple of empty front pockets for additional gear.  With all that weight, the pack is still comfortable to wear and has yet to bother my back
These DVDs are probably the highest quality and most reliable that I have tried.  And given their low price, what is there not to like?  I would recommend these to just about anyone
In comparison to the component cables, the quality is a little better.  I don't think I agree with those who say you MUST have HDMI cables to get a good picture, but I am extremely satisfied with the product and I don't regret purchasing it.  Amazon's price for this product is unmatched
Totally agree with the other reviewers' comments. Originally, I was going to buy Canon's adapter for my Powershot A640 not realizing it was plastic!! Plus, even with shipping, this is still cheaper (by 5 bucks) and its metal! FYI--If you don't have any filters (like I didn't) get Tiffens 3 filter set 52mm (Circular Polarizer, UV protector, and 812-warming len) a good buy for the price--I bought it because of the reviewers' comments and don't regret it
It costs 30% - 40% less than the Canon LA-DC58F Conversion Lens Adapter and it's metal, not plastic... need to say more
I purchased 4 of these adapters (3 extra) so I could hook up my macbook's digital output for digital surround sound through my Logitech speakers. The product works exactly as I expected... great digital sound from my macbook. Parts Express did an excellent job of getting my order to me sooner than I expected (ordered on a Saturday, and they had the package to the courier by Saturday night.) Very prompt service... I would definitely order from them again. Overall a great product from a prompt company!
I've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years.  I've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday.  I ride a motorcycle everyday and I never leave without these.  First, the comfort is exceptional.  Even with my helmet on, I never get uncomfortable with these in my ears.  I've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems.  Even when I need a break from the music, I leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise.  I've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best, but most are painful with a helmet on.  The "bulb" you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear, so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep.  Second, the sound quality is fantastic.  Great bass, mids, and highs.  I've heard things in my music I never knew was there and I can't wait to listen more.  I can't recommend these enough.  I've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine
Excellant product, excellant price, hope to do business again, ty, for fast speedy shipment, a pleasure doing business with you
This really works, i have 3 zp100's and 1 zp80, using a NAS for storage of my mp3's. the whole thing hangs together perfectly. if you want to get music through your whole house this is a great way to do it. MOST IMPORTANTLY TECH SUPPORT IS GREAT!!!
Wow! I didn't trust the other review.  I needed a mini amp, so I decided to bought this one, because of the price and of the dual purpose.  Right out of the box, it actually smell bacon!! Amazing, it was true!  And not only that.  If someone is trying to kick you out of your house because of the noise of your beloved amp, and don't want to stop, this is the mini amp for you.  Can't believe the speaker in it.  And, about the disto, well, is OK for practice. Won't regret about it.
I have had this items before, in fact this is a replacement for one that was mounted on my motor home. the windshield had to be replaced and a new antenna was needed. Works fine, just like the one before. A very eash purchase and fast delivery
I've been using this NAS for a month and it's great!  The box is quite speedy with a Maxtor ATA 133 drive with a 16mb cache.  I have it wired and it never disconnects and will transfer large files without hanging.  Got it up and working in around 40 minutes and have it set to incrementally back up my files.  Very slick!  I can't get the built in FTP server to work through my firewall but I think that's a ports issue.  All in all a great box
I wanted to be able to shoot lots over several days without dragging a laptop with me through multiple airports. I bought two and both worked fine, right out of the box. Not the fastest card ever, but certainly large storage for the price
When I bought these I was mainly looking for a long enough cord to be able to put my MP3 player in my pocket. Not only is the cord legnth great but so is the sound. I didn't expect the sound quality to be so good in such an inexpensive product. The cord also has a built in volume control so I don't have to dig the player out of my pocket to adjust the volume. The buds are quite comfortable, I have worn them for hours at a time with no problem. I love these
I just purchased a MoGo mouse, and I'm *amazed* at how usable it is.  I was extremely skeptical (and probably wouldn't have bought one) until I was able to try a colleague's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is.  The ONE thing - and it's a pretty big thing - is the lack of "scroll-wheel" technology.  That's a sorely missed feature in this mouse.That said, there are always trade-offs, but in this case that's the only one.  Battery life seems great, usability is great, convenience is great...just add the touch pad and it'll be THE mouse for notebook computer users!
When you look at the price, it may seem pricey but when you get the product, there is some serious engineering involved.  The web reviews have all been favorable and this is the reason I bought an Ergotron.  The attention to detail is incredible.  Mounting the middle monitor is definitely a two-person job. Other than that the installation was flawless.  This is a very solid and well machined.  Kudos to Ergotron.  (Also these guys are serious about ergonomics -- 10 pages on how to set proper height for various installations.) Wonderful product - 5 stars.  Shipping from Amazon was slow and behind schedule.
I am an IT Director and bought these for exercisers for my users. The outside is like a balloon, only much stronger rubber, and the inside is gel. When you squeeze them, the part that squeezes through your fingers changes color - it's cool! The resistance is very good and my users love them! Good product - great value and excellent quality
When you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great, but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate. It really seems to run out of one color much quicker  than the others. Personally its usually red. It has caught me with my pants  down a couple times, going to print out a project the night before its due,  only to run out of red or blue ink. I would definetly suggest to always  have an extra one around just in case
I use only the best products, not refills or other manufactures as I have had problems with print cartridges that have ruined my printers. The HP ink jet cartridges are the best. I will always buy them
This is a great case. I have had no problems with it, and works very well. It's also very "sexy" if you want to put it that way, and looks really cool. Only trouble I have is that when I open it sometimes, it'll make a click sound because 2 pieces touch, but its very minor and does no damage. It's a great item! However, if you intend to bang your laptop around a lot, I'd recommend one of those soft outer cases too, because this is not intended to protect the hard drive etc. Just protect it from scratches and smudges. I recommend it highly
After ruining another pair of over-the-head headphones, I decided to check these out.  They are actually on sale at 50% off, and I've just tried mine out.  The audio is very sharp, especially with the base, though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair, I can just increase the volume to compensate.  At $35, this is a GREAT deal.  They feel great.  The band that most headphones have presses down on your head, but not too much.  It also folds down quite nicely, though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress.  Haven't tried out the actual noise-cancellation feature, but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent, then it will work just as well.  It also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your MP3 player, if you so wished.  However, it easily fits into a jacket pocket.  Great, great, great design and comfort
This card works exactly as stated by StarTech. I bought two - one for a PC and one for a Mac, popped 'em in and plugged in iPods, external hardrives, a scanner, and digital cameras and the cards worked perfectly. The PC needed a quick setup and the Mac worked instantly!And all at a great price!Can't figger out why you guys are having trouble
Bought this player for its size (sports) and its Napster compatibility. Updated the firmware after having a rocky start; but things seem a little more stable now. Also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods (around 0 degrees Celsius) - odd behaviour - but mostly OK now that we are in the Spring teens again. Haven't found a case yet to protect from sweat. Interface is what I expected - dead simple. No complaints for the price
I was ready to take this player back to the store!  I checked the sandisk web site and stumbled across a link to "how to" videos.  This was the best thing I could have found.  The videos walk through all the settings you need to configure on your PC to get the player to work for drag and drop, showing album art...  I had no idea my PC was set not to show hidden folders!  Who would hide folders anyway?  Nonetheless I now have a player loaded with music and am a happy customer.  Like others have said the photo option is not that great so don't buy it for that.  I mostly want it for working out so pics don't make much of a difference to me.  DH has a 30G ipod so if I wanna see graphics I can just borrow that lol!I have over 250 mp3 formatted songs on the player (and it's full) and will likely get a micro SD card so I can expand it a little bit.All in all, I do like this little player
Excellent machine, great performance Saved lot of time and desk space. Great Scanning speed and qualit
I have had other APC battery backup's in the past, and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit.  Given our power failures, brown out, and the high wind and storms in our area the APC does an excellent job.  I have not only my desktop PC, but my scanner, printer and digital camera on the system and it has saved my equipment numerous time for the power surges and failures
     I did a lot of research, not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later. I was about to buy the newest 40" 720p Samsung for $1899... then I stumbled upon this one at Circuit City for $1999 and bought it on the spot... paid about $50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later. I've had it a week now, and I love it.     Standard-definition picture quality is just okay, but are any of us buying these TVs to watch SDTV? I get about 15 HD channels through my cable company, including all four major networks plus ESPN, ESPN2 and a couple music and movie channels. Therefore, a majority of everything I watch is available in HD anyway. SDTV content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10-12 feet. HD content looks awesome (including black levels), and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p. I can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available.     I'm going to wait another year or two for the High-Definition DVD format war to play out before I buy a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player. But I've watched standard-definition DVD on my Xbox with this TV, and the picture is beautiful. I'm sure High-Definition DVD would look a little better in a side-by-side comparison, but you will not have any complaints watching standard-definition DVD on this TV.     In short, this is an excellent TV, especially compared to other 1080p  models in its size range. If you're looking for something in the range of $2000-$2200, this is the one you want. Enjoy
There are over 100 reviews. I am not saying the same thing again. I just throw my rating in.All I can say is... You will be better off if you completely learn how to master this calculator
I have been using this mouse at work since it came out. After many miles of use, the scroll wheel has finally started to fail.  I can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls.  The best feature of this mouse is the battery life.  A coworker who swears by his Logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple of months, but I usually got at least ten months out of mine.  I even took to dating the batteries when I installed them, just to rub it in.This mouse is a bit heavy and does not slide as well as some, but overall I would recommend it.Going to try a rechargable Logitech next time around
I don't know where the guy below got that this card doesn't work with Windows Media Center Edition because I just installed the latest XP drivers for the card on Media Center Edition 2005 and it works perfectly.  I sold my GIGAPort AG to get this because of the much better signal/noise ratio that the FireWire Audiophile has and it made a big difference.  Very clean sound!  I use it to DJ with using MixVibes, using the ASIO drivers and it works beautifully!  A great buy to say the least... pick one up, you wont regret it
We purchased this TV in Dec of 2006.  We are very happy with it.  It was very easy to plug and play...had it ready in no time for holiday... I would definitely recommed it to new buyers
It was easy ordering, easy delivery and satisfying outcome. Love the TV
Have only used it a couple of times in a month, and feel like I've already justified the low cost. - Should be fine for my intermittent use
First off... I like this unit.  It's EASY to use, and it does a fine job of taking your old LPs and making CDs out of them.  All you need to do is place a blank AUDIO CD into the deck (it doesn't work with regular data CDs), hit the phono/aux button, followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the LP... take it out of pause.  It starts recording instantly.  Between each song, hit a button and it break the recording into tracks.  Pretty cool!It's got great potential, but there are still a few shortcomings.  For example, I was surprised to see that it doesn't let you record off of the radio.  Just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio tuner wasn't digital. It's a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations.  You turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago.I wouldn't mind the analog tuner too much if it at least had a handful of presets.  This also makes the remote control somewhat useless too.  Oddly, the remote does have an AM/FM button.  They should just label it the "Radio" button, because when you think of it, switching from AM to FM or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re-tune the station too, using the dial.Another key point is that the unit doesn't have any outputs at all.  So you can't pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers.I would rate this as 3.5 stars, but since we can't use half stars, I'll give it 4 for one big reason.... For all it's shortcomings, it works, and there are very few alternatives.Speaking of alternatives, here are a few other options.1. A standalone CD-Recorder.  I have one of these too.  The advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old cassette deck.  In my case, my stand alone unit has two drives, so not only can I record from any source in my system, but I can dub from one drive to the other.  Also, my deck can make MP3 CDs from regular CDs (It's easier than using a PC, however the song titles are just numbers).  In my case, I opted not to use this for my LP projects, because I no longer have a turntable.  I decided that as long as I needed a new turntable, I might as well pay a bit more for this unit.2. Crosley makes a simuilar unit, but it costs a bit more and the reviews I read seemed to point out that although it looks better, the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot.3. A portable digital recorder like the iKey Plus.  I found one of these a few weeks ago and I love it.  You plug your turntable or other external source into it... plug a USB storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality (.WAV vs several MP3 sampling rates)... Viola!  It records directly to your flash drive, iPod or external hard drive.  If you do go that route, make sure you get the "Plus" model.  The older model is outdated and doesn't work as well.4. Use a PC.  Even though it will give you the best possible sound and options, it's out of the question for me because I do not want to move my PC near my stereo every time I want to make a recording, nor do I want to move my stereo next to my PC... or bog it down while I'm trying to use it for that matter.Keep in mind that if you record your CDs using one of the stand alone decks, you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the CDs you made into a PC afterwards, then filtering the files with your favorite audio software, then re-burn the files to CD or MP3.
Right price and works off of USB!  The sound is terrible on MacBook so this will fill in nicely
I bought this cute little speaker from Walmart (14$) and it is so compact and very useful. It also matches with my other speakers of Sony Dream system.This has 4 USB ports (So good when they stay on your desktop rather than on your pC sitiing down the table.). They are lighted, so that you can plug them in even night. Speaker is good quality and it has one USB connection and One DC connection.Quality of sound is good if not excellent. Overall It is a great buy for the price.
Works as advertised, I needed longer range and it provided, easy setup, stable connection
Fast Service and great price!  Work great for about a mile or so but then I got them for shopping with my wife, she is at one end of the store and I am at the other
So I received my Go-510 and expected it to work right out of the box.  It powered up, great windshield adapter, no problems with the connections, bluetooth works perfectly, Ipod controls - no problem.  Just one thing, NO SATELLITE FIX !!  It would not lock on - even after one hour in the open sky.  I thought, here goes....bad tech support....ship it back...But no.  I called tech support, got through to a human (very knowledgable) in only 20 seconds.  Problem was fixed by upgrading firmware and the unit works perfectly.  I read on many sites of the problems plaguing these units.  Apparently, they have all the bugs out because every aspect, every feature is cool and workable.  The TomTom Go-510 is highly recommended in my book and mad props to the tech support crew - way to roll
sent quickly and nicely packaged. these will do the job for those desiring a shorter recording program
This is my first experience with HDTV and wide screen.  This 46" Sony TV is excellent with HD programs; with regular broadcasts, it is a bit muddy, but that is the fault of the signal, not the TV.  I am very pleased with the overall quality of the set.  I had the set professionally installed and set up, and I am sure glad I did: install and set up are not for amateurs like me; if anything ever happens, I will be hard pressed to reset things.  Sony's instruction manuals are not that great
My Panasonic RV31K is five years old this month and after thousands of hours playing movies it works just as well today as when I first took it out of the box. Panasonic makes quality products and just like anything else mechanical you can get a lemon. If this player ever dies (cross my fingers) I will get another Panasonic. I choose mine after reading all of the reviews here and in epinions.co
The stick came in an excellent condition, and works perfectly. I recommend this product.
I had looked at numerous stands for my Yamaha keyboard and didn't want to spend a ton of money for a professional grade stand (at professional prices).  With that in mind, the Yamaha PKBX2 Double X Portable Keyboard Stand is a good choice at $29.99.  I had seen other stands that were not as sturdy (single X stands)and cost about the same price.Tips for assembly: - Don't read the instructions, just look at the enlarged image of the keyboard on Amazon and assemble the stand the way it's shown.- The bolts for attaching the arms and legs come screwed in to the stand.  Use the (included )Allen Wrench to remove them.PROS:- Low price.- Solid, sturdy stand.- Works for just about any keyboard.- The stand's height is fully adjustable, and can be done in several seconds - without having to unscrew anything.CONS:- There is no way to attach a keyboard to this stand.  No screws, bolts or straps are included, even though most (including my Yamaha) keyboards have pre-drilled holes for screwing the board to a stand.  The keyboard simply sits on top of the stand.  I was VERY disappointed about this.- The included Allen wrench did not work for one of the bolts.  The bolt came screwed in to the stand way too tightly to be removed using the included tool.  The Allen Wrench only stripped the bolt, it did not loosen it.  Luckily my husband had a better Allen Wrench of nearly identical size, and that one worked.  Without it, we would not have been able to loosen the bolt
Elegant design, sturdy construction.  Supports my Yamaha SY35 securely.  After reading the forbidding reviews I decided to assemble it without first reading the directions.  It took me 10 min
I'm very happy with this device.  The suction cup holds very securly.  I would advise anyone who buys a satellite receiver to skip the adhesive mounting bracket that comes with it, it will come un-stuck eventually.  Just get one of these brackets and mount the radio right in the first place
If you like to listen to audio tapes you will like this one. Replacing the provided headphones is a good idea. FM reception a little weak, but the tape play time on ONE AA battery is amazing. Lightweight and good quality for the price
By far this is the best printer I've had I been buying epson for many years if you like your pictures to have that pro photo look this the printer to own.The price is great delivery was very quick rec'd it next day.When you buy epson you won't back.
Came quickly and was exactly as offered. I am completly satisfie
I mean seriously, I'm running a Ubuntu box here. With other card-type things, sometimes I'd have to modify or find drivers and wrappers for some stuff to work - not with this. I just slid it into the computer and WA-BAM - makes my DVD player a bajillion times faster than it was before and just worked out of the box
I just purchased the Archos 604 about 3weeks ago. So far so good. It interfaces very easily with the computer. Though I have not tried it using Windows Media 10 yet. I recommend at least buying the Archos Docking Adapter Kit (if you do not plan on using the Archos to record programs). It allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos.The only negative that I have so far is that the volume, at its highlest level, is difficult to hear on an airplane. You may need some noise canceling headphones
I ordered this for my teenage daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  The sound is great and the amplifier works well.  For the price it plays like a much more expensive instrument.  I recommend this to any new player wanting to learn the guitar
I received a pleasent surprise. The keyboard was shipped sooner than I expected, arrived in perfect condition and works beautifully. I will buy from this vendor again
It does work/live with DSL installed on the same line, ever heard of DSL filters? Too small? are you kidding? this phone is great all around
The price I paid for this spindle of CD-R's was pretty good and have not had a problem yet. The only price that I have seen that beats this one was Staples running a sale of 50 for $10, but I have yet to use the stock that I bought as I still have about 25 left on the spindle. If you don't want to wait for their sale, this is an excellent bargain. The print surface has done very well with the inks from my Epson Photo R-220
The case is nice, but I bought it thinking it would hold my folding keyboard.  It was too small.  The price was great, and the transaction was flawless
 Compact flouresecent bulbs will not fit this fixture unless you order special CF's with extended bases. Other than that, it can't be beat for the price and quality. Adorama Rocks
I enjoyed putting this together. The spacers kinda threw me until I realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf. I got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the DVD shelves weren't spaced properly [CD sized] so I had to take it apart and redo it, but that wasn't too bad. The spacers snap apart easily enough, even for my feeble fingers.  It's not terribly sturdy [maybe I didn't get the poles screwed down tightly enough] but as long as it's in its permanent location, holds the multimedia well. I really like the way it looks. Bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one, too :
The AMD Ahtlon 64 Venice processor is great. Installed into my new Gigabyte MB without a hitch and runs very cool. That will give up some room for future overclocking. Overall I would highly recommend the processor. By applying for their credit card, I received a really low price from Amazon which was very surprising. About $170.00 with free shipping and no tax. Everyone else was $200-$230 for the same processor. It is a great CPU at a good price from Amazon
I looked at all the different cases for my new iPod with video, and the reviews kept pointing me back to this case.  So I bought it.  it exceeds my expectations.  It's fantastic.My ipod is now completely contained and scratchproof.  This helps when down the road I might want to sell it.The screen cover is perfectly clear and seems very durable.  I like the fact that it's held off of the ipod's screen so it won't scratch.  The clickwheel is easily usable, actually more so because of the circle around it.I bought the case on Amazon from SonicSwap and am astounded at how fast I got it.  2 days! Amazing.This case is for the 60GB iPod with Video.  It clearly says that in the title; not sure how that one reviewer got confused about that.Don't hesitate.  This is THE case
I gave my son a Garmin 60C for Christmas last year. Tinkered with it for a couple of days before handing it over. It worked well. Of course I wanted one for myself, but cash is cash, so I've been putting it off. (Side note - I wanted to borrow it for a trip this past spring, and when they went to get it, it had been stolen from their car map-pocket. It seems these are high-theft items; keep'em on a short leash.) My wife hadn't gotten me any "big" Christmas gift, so I told her I knew what I wanted, and started shopping. I debated between the eXplorist 500 and 600. Chose the 600, with its altimeter and thermometer. Probably could have lived without them, but hey, it's Christmas!It came yesterday, so I charged it a bit, and then it had no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover. I had to go out to the street for the Garmin to find satellites. Took it out for a spin today. Spot-on navigation as I ran errands. It tracked back almost to the exact spot I had marked for home, though it had me driving down the wrong side of the street on that portion of my route that was a duplicate - so it's off by a few feet. (Maybe it still thinks it's in Britain?)Now - why only 4 stars? 1) the USB connector can attach to the unit either way. There's no instructions anywhere to say which way it should go. I called the 800 # and spoke with someone (in New Delhi) who had heard this a lot. She told me what to do, and the PC immediately recognized the GPS file system - as a removable disk drive, as advertised. I really find their Website information near-zero. Something as elementary as this should be covered on a Website after the 3rd call, eh?2) I bought the Mapsend 3D Topo software. I am interested in elevations. And it has detailed street maps. BUT - they're not routable! If you want routable streets (where the unit will route you along streets and not just a crow's flight direct path) for following in a car, then either you have to get both map products, or choose. It's rather frustrating. And the sales information provided on Amazon and the Magellan sites does not make this critical lack very clear. It tells you what you can do, but not what you can't and there's no product comparison to see what the differences are. On the Mapsend Topo box, it says very clearly, "NAVTEQ roads and streets data - like that found in the most expensive car navigation systems (non-routable)". Er, excuse me, then it's not quite like that found in expensive car systems, is it? I concur with other reviewers who find the software selection verbiage (on Amazon and Magellan) more obfuscating than informative. Why can't someone create a simple comparison chart for all the various map packages
This card is one of the best, the  graphics are very high! i play games at full specs, needs a big chassis because generates heat, i did bought a TT Armor and my system works better, easy installation.
Not a bad product, but has very little bass response and the weather channel does not come in very well, no matter where the antenna is positione
I have been using a lot mouses during last years,but this is the best far away from the others.It's very comfortable to use it.....
I compared it with low cost Monoprice and high cost Monster cable. I picked up 10' cable for about $70.00 from Amazon few months ago. It's been working pretty well. No complains so far and I like the thinness of cable.
This 23" LCD HDTV has excellent image quality and looks really stylish, too.  It also comes with HDMI so you can hook up the latest HD video source such as HD-DVD or Blue-ray hi-def DVD players.  The LCD panel itself displays vivid, evenly-lit images, and ghosting appears to not be a problem on this model.I personally ended up opting for the Sharp LD-23SH1U HDTV LCD monitor because the Sharp works as PC/Mac monitor (plus J started offering a $[...]rebate).  But I think this Panasonic is a great choice, too, no doubt about that
I purchased this so my PC could share a monitor with my XBOX360.  Does the job at a cheap cost!  So easy to use that my 4 yr. old can use it
I've had this phone less than a week, but I have been pleased with it's performance so far. The set up was somewhat tricky, as many, if not all Skype addresses use a period in the address. None of the literature showed how to find the period. By accident I noticed it was available on the 1 button. After discovering that, the installation went flawlessly. If one is already familiar with the use of the alpha/numeric keypad, one would have no problems. If one is learning on this phone with the literature provided, one needs help. The phone has worked well with both the landline, and the Skypeout alternatives. I'm pleased enough that I'm buying two more as the equipment will accomodate up to four phones.
This is just Great. Lots of storage for data files and pictures. Allows me to keep my file with me where ever I go. No additonal software required, just plug it in the USB Port and you have instant files, fast and easy to use. Small in size but big in storage. I give it 5 stars
Code length of this product is very small. I had to buy an extention cord.The sound quality is not bad
Turns out I don't like in-ear ear phones.  The sound on these is good, though the bass is a bit much in my opinion.  The in-ear style makes me feel deaf to the outside world.  If you do like this style, these are pretty good.
These are the only reliable disks I have found.  I began a collection of Friends on my dvd-rws.  I have over 25 disks full so far and only had minimal problems with 1 or 2 disks.  I rewatch all my favorite episodes, of which I have over 100 and have no problems.  These are the best
with over 3 hours recording time,these are great. I use them for meetings. No problems or errors
To my eyes, the printer's rendition of colors is above average. It isn't horrible but neither is it the best. Pricewise it's an excellent deal with the 64mg of memory and the duplex feature. We've been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via Tray 2 (the default paper supply) and haven't any problems. The manual (electronic file) advises "Never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels." So it's a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label. A wonderful quality of experience is the near "instant on" (very minimal warmup) feature and it's quiet. My previous Okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before printing. Its time delay was also a disadvantage. I think most people will be very happy with the HP.[...
I got the Canon CP400 printer a while back so I could make the occasional print to hand out (or put silly captions on "bad" Christmas party photos).I don't know how the printer manages to keep the image aligned as the paper goes in and out 4 times (yellow, magenta, blue, and the clear coat) but when it drops it out, I have a pretty nice print, complete with address lines and a stamp outline on back (plus Canon logo of course) - suitable for mailing as a postcard. About 1/2" of each end gets removed  after printing as it is used for traction of the rubber roller in the printer.I frequently print 3 shots vertically on a 4 x 6 card as sort of a mini proof sheet. I've also used the 4 x 8 size to print 2 side by side.Fun stuff
This is a great printer for those who want to print on 12x12 scrapbook pages. It works well with heavier(cardstock) paper. It also prints great photos. I have a MAC i-book. I also use The Print Shop 2 program with it. It gives me great versatility with my pages  photos
My criteria for my new printer purchase was:1. 11x172. individual inks3. reliable printer company4. easy installation/good customer service5. price (this was a bit pricey but the next step up was not a choice)So far for my needs this has been a great printer so far.  It does great quality prints for photos, school projects and more.  I wanted to have more versatility to make posters, labels, photos, etc...  My last HP wide format printer (1200c) lasted for over 5 years and I took it everywhere.  I have only had this for a few motnhs but it hasn't been a disappointment yet

Its a great graphics card, especially for the price. I got it to improve Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and it did. But the controls arent as clear as they could be for the anti-aliasing settings and the anisotropic filtering
The only thing I will say about the BDP-S1 is that it is top quality.Picture and sound quality are top-notch, but everything really depends on the software.Now, if you are undecided about which camp to follow (Blu-ray or HD DVD), I'm here to tell you that Blu-ray will win.You see, I have both Blu-ray and HD DVD.I have about 20 HD DVD movies and about 20 Blu-ray movies. In terms of picture and sound quality, they are the same, but it is completely dependant on the software.But here is where the similarities end.1) Blu-ray is more durable. The BD movie discs have scratch-resistant coating. They don't scratch unless you forcefully scratch them.On the other hand, the HDDVD movies scratch like heck. I put all of my movies in a CD case. I recently noticed that ALL the HDDVD movies are scratched, but NONE of the Blu-ray movies are scratched. These are stored in the SAME CD case by me. I am extremely careful. None of my movies even have a fingerprint on them. So when I see scratches on 100% of my HDDVD movies, that really upsets me!!!!!2) Blu-ray costs less to BUY.What? Superman Returns BD is $24, Superman HDDVD is $28. The Departed BD is $24, The Departed HDDVD is $28.Now the HDDVD DUAL format has both a standard DVD and HDDVD movie, but who in their right mind would want to buy an HDDVD to watch a 480p picture? Right now you can get a $500 PS3 or $400 Toshiba HDDVD player. Later this year, Sony will come out with a $300 Blu-Ray disc player. HDDVD will most likely drop their prices. So the hardware will cost the same in both formats.3) Blu-ray has more capacity.For less money, you can get a 50GB Blu-ray movie versus a 30GB HDDVD movie.And what if in 5 years they develope SUPER High-Definition 1920p picture and SUPER Hi-Def 8.1 DTS-HD Sound? What if this requires 75GB or 100GB?HDDVD can go up to 51GB.Peace.
So far, so good!  Only takes up 1U in our rack. This product arrived in good shape and on time.  Setup was a breeze.  Right now we only have 2 servers connected to it, but switching between them is no problem, so I don't foresee a problem when we add 4 more.-Kevi
I hva tried alll kinds of stuff on the iPod, and this is th eonly one that got rid of all the scratches. Thanks for a  fantastic product
I can't remember when I felt so good about an online purchase.  The product is more than I expected for the money and the quick service just awed me!  I will definately be doing business through AMAZON many, many more times in the future!  THANK YOU
Use original Epson Brand ink, the heads in the epson printers it's in the printer itself not in the ink cartridge, it dosent worth saving some dollars and ruing the printer
I bought this printer to print my shipping labels faster. It's easy to use! It prints very fast.Print quality is excellent. Changing diferent type of labels is easy too. I highly recommend this printer
Everything about the Sonos worked as advertised.  It was a snap to set up and it is slicker than I anticipated.  The interface is commonsense and well thought out.  It is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously.  You can also play different music, all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio.   It is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises
The XMB-10 is a great way to listen to my XM Audiovox receiver at home. The boombox is slightly larger than I desired, but the sound is great, it's easy to use, lightweight, very portable and nice looking.
I agree with the comments posted here.  Like most of us, I was interested in the Bose sound yet put off by the prestige price.  Even on E-Bay the going price ended up being around $400 -- for a used older model.  So I did some research and stumbled upon a nice comparison-shopper article that put the Bose up against several competitors, including this high-end TEAC.  I have to say that I'm entirely satisfied.The chrome retro look is quite appealing, and the model has a couple of features that, for me, beat out Bose entirely.  I wanted a top-loading door like the old Bose models but also the ability to play MP3 like the new ones, and this gave me both.  The sound and punch is remarkable.  At flat setting, it is a bit bassy, that's true, but you get a -5 to+ 5 range for both bass and treble adjustment: I set mine at -3 and +1 respectively and am very happy with the sound in my bedroom.  Input and alarm functions are limited but not problematic.  10 presets can be cycled though quickly enough, and just remember to set it to a station (or load a CD) that you'd want to be woken up to before calling it a night!TEAC customer service I can't comment on, but I bought a reconditioned unit from an Amazon seller for less than $100, including shipping.  A sweet deal for a sweet machine.
I didn't want to fork over 500 for a BOSE or Boston Acoustics, or even 350 for a Cambridge Soundworks, and then I found this little gem, for about 175 + shipping.  I've had it for a few days, and so far I am impressed.The SX  functions are very intuitive, easy to set the time and both alarms.  I thought it was extremely innovative to have the button that sets the time located inside the CD player compartment, no more accidentally changing the time instead of the alarm!  The alarm buttons themselves will illuminate when they are activated, which is great.  The buttons themselves have a nice click when you press them, and the CD, AM/FM tuner, and AUX buttons will glow when they are active.  The volume control and tuner knobs are recessed, but this keeps the player from having any unsightly bulges I suppose.  The snooze/sleep button is a good size.  The sleep function can be toggled for 90, 60, or 30 minutes.The range of the speakers is great when you consider the size of the SX.  The speakers measure about 2.5 inches, and with the volume turned up, you can definitely feel the air being pushed out of the bottom of the unit.  I like that it has adjustable bass and treble, which can vary from -5 to +5.  I have the bass set to +3 and treble to +2 and it sounds great.  It doesn't have the range of say a home entertainment system, but definitely rivals my Sony bookshelf system.The MP3 player on the SX could be better, but is adequate.  During playback, the LCD will scroll to display the filename, title, artist, and track.  It can be programmed for up to 64 tracks, but I haven't had the time or patience for this.  Instead, I just numbered the MP3 tracks in the order I wanted before burning them to the CD-rom.  The repeat function works well, and you can choose either to repeat one track, repeat all tracks, or repeat just one folder.  However, the shuffle function is rather limited, as it has only one setting which is to randomly play an MP3 from any of the folders (resulting in less than desired combinations of music), and it stop playing music after each song from all the folders has been played once.One of the things I looked for in a clock radio is an auxilliary input mini-jack, and it also has a jack for headphones.  I have my laptop on my nightstand right now, and it playing MP3s on winamp sound great plugged into the SX.There are only 2 levels of brightness for the backlit LCD.  The default level cannot be changed or dimmed, and is rather bright in a dark room.. it will make everything glow.  Takes a little while to get used to, but is not say brighter than a typical nightlight I guess.  It is a bit hard to read at night because the numbers are so small, and the brightness of the LCD can kind of drown out the analog display, but then again I wear glasses so I suppose I have nothing to blame besides my bad eyes.  When the radio or CD player is in operation, the dial becomes significantly brighter but it can be toggled to the lower/default level with the dimmer button on the remote control.One other thing about the unit was the lack of a battery backup, and you will notice this is the case with many Japanese units, including the Sony clock radios.  I guess the power grid in Japan is really stable, so they don't have use for this, but still, it would be nice if there was an option for a backup 9 volt battery.  On the other hand, I was informed by TEAC tech support that the unit does contain a capcitor which will retain the time and alarm for "up to 3 hours".  I haven't had the time to test the maximum threshold, but I can say that I did unplug the clock for about a minute, and when I plugged it back in, sure enough the time and alarms were still correct.Overall I am really impressed by this unit.  The only thing that could be better is if the MP3 player shuffle had a few more options, but I guess this is ok as many I have seen MP3 clock radios without any shuffle function at all!  Also, I wish the LCD backlight could be adjusted a little more.  It is a bit pricey at just under 200, but I have heard many clock radios, and you would have to spend 350+++ to get anywhere near the sound quality of the TEAC SX
I got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it.  The unit is beautifully designed, fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small.  My only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong.  I live in a tough area for reception, and there's slight static on my favorite stations.  The FM antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit, but the reception is still not totally clear.That being said, I'm glad I got it, and when my wife's happy, I'm happy
This is an excellent power conditioner and voltage stabilizer,all in one.This unit  can protect your sensitive high end audio system,computers,and video moniters,from....Everyday,power surges,power sags,over voltages,and brown-outs.These surges,  pick away at your sensitive equipment..taking years off their useful life...i own and highly recommend,this unit
I've had HP and Lexmark printers in the past.  This Canon outshines both of the other brands.  It is super easy to install WITHOUT any troubleshooting.  Works like a charm.  The prints looks great
I use my LX4 2.1 system as my desktop PC speakers. I got this recommendation from Maximum PC, since the LX4 5.1 system was 2005's best speaker system. You can view their gear of the year review here: http://www.maximumpc.com/2005/12/m-audio_studiop_1.html. Being skeptical of a $550 5.1 system with only 27 watts to each satellite, I wanted to start slow and only ordered the 2.1 system. As soon as I purchased cables (FYI: no 1/8" stereo to two 1/4" mono cables seem to exists -as far as I've seen--, so you have to use adaptors) I was blown away by the crisp flowing sounds of the speakers. I wasn't used to speakers with crossovers, where only the each type of speaker (tweeter, woofer, and sub) gets the right frequencies, so no overlapping exists. All the sounds are crystal clear and the housings is very dense and resilient, while the speakers themselves are of superb build quality. After only a few hours of listening to many kinds of music and playing sound-intensive games, I immediately hopped back online and ordered myself the 5.1 expander setup.If you are looking for speakers that play really loud, or can fill a living room with the desired feel for an action movie, these are not for you. But if you want incredibly accurate PC speakers or relatively cheap studio monitors this is definitely the setup for you. You will not be disappointed if you buy the LX4 for your bedroom or for computer use
Amazing sound comes from these tiny inexpensive headphones. The different size buds are very comfortable and help produce the deep bass sound once you find the pair the fit your ear. when I first got them I put the smallest buds on first and thought I had just bought the worst headphones. So I tried the largest buds and found they fit very comfortably and because of the seal they created in my ears they acted as an air tight bass box improving the sound ten fold.And just let you know I ussualy cant wear earbud headphones because they hurt my ear holes or they just don't fit righ
I reserved the 5th star rating for this unit as I haven't authored or copied very many DVDs with it yet.  However, what I have accomplished with it is commendable.  I can copy an entire commercial DVD (Movie + all the extras) under 50 minutes.  I have composed a Slide show DVD with my own MP3 background music selections and am quite pleased with it.So far, no coasters.  I am now in the process of producing DVDs of my old 8mm home movies.  The converter is giving me more problems than anything.  Still recommend the PX-755UF for anyone interested in an external burner.  Installation was a snap (plug-n-play)
These fit over everything very well, and they stayed put without stretching out, which is why my original pads fell off.  I guess it's one of those products that you can't do much better than $10 for, but maybe they could give you double the number of pads or something..
I would give a high recommendation for this TV.  It is the perfect size for a bedroom especially if you're not looking to overwhelm the room but you just want something to watch a late night movie, the morning or evening news, or the late shows in high def.  DVD player works great and really completes the package as it seems not to increase the size of the TV at all.  The picture is outstanding and isn't that what really matters in the end??!!  The only little annoying thing concerns what would have been a great feature but has a big limitation - the TV has an auto-on feature so that you can use it like an alarm clock but it requires that you select a channel on which to tune the TV once it goes on.  It you are use the HDMI as I am to get signal from your cable box, you must have the TV input mode set to HDMI but you can't set the auto-on to the HDMI input (it must be a channel number).  The engineers just didn't think that one through all the way.  Oh well, still a great TV
Got this drive a few weeks ago for an Apple Power Mac G4 Cube.The G4 Cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious.  Thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed.  This drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is.  Unbelievable.  Don't even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep.Disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6-8 inches from the Cube and is totally non-existent more than 12 inches from the Cube.Will not hesitate to buy Seagate Barracuda drives for all future machines.The 5-year warranty is a winner.Highly recommend this drive for its silence, speed, cost and warranty
I used these speakers (4) as part of my 7.1 channel theater and I used the HTI 55 Center channel plus the HTI 8" Ceiling to finish off my system.  I have a Denon 2307CI pumping these speakers and let me tell you, I can't even crank up the system to the highest as these speakers ROCK my entire house FROM THE BASEMENT!!!  These are the best in wall SPEAKERS I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!!!!  Buy them now before they're all gone!Highly recommend
The chip works just as advertised.  I have had no problems with it, it was easily formatted to my Kodak camera, and it stores a huge amount of pictures and video, either about 280 pictures or almost an hour of video.  Great product, I would recommend it for anyone looking for a lot of storage space for a good price
We now have three of the K850 printers in use, one with a built in print server, second paper tray, and duplexer.  So far, the printers have proved to be reliable, fast, and comparatively inexpensive to operate.  Power on, pre-print, and post-print noise may be objectionable to users who are located close to the printer.Capable of using the same HP 10 black and HP 11 individual color ink cartridges, as well as replacement print heads as the HP Business Ink Jet 1100d and HP Business Ink Jet 1200d, the K850 shares the same low, per page operating cost as the 1100d and 1200d printers.  Full page color photographs print in roughly 32 seconds, with a roughly eight second delay prior to the start of printing; similar prints from other printers may require from one to five minutes to print the same full page color photograph.  White horizontal lines were present in the full page color photograph, possibly indicating that one or two of the nozzles in the print heads, shipped with the new printer, are defective.The printer handles paper sizes up to 13" x 19", so it easily handles B size (tabloid, 11" x 17") paper commonly used for small engineering prints and foldable newsletters.  The printer software installs without problem, although a reboot will likely be required.  For network capable K850 printers, the software install automatically finds K850 printers on the network, and adds a "HP Standard TCP/IP Port" to the computer configuration for communication with the printer.  For non-network capable K850 printers, both USB and parallel port connections are supported.Positives:* Uses ink that is compatible with other printer models, helping to keep operating costs down.* Fast printing for full page color, and even faster black printing with spot color.* Large format color printing, which is helpful for quick generation of engineering prints.* Nearly idiot proof print cartridge replacement - light turns on to indicate the color that needs to be replaced, printing stops automatically, user replaces ink cartridge, and printing continues.* Separate ink cartridges and print heads means less aligning of print cartridges/heads after ink cartridge replacement, larger capacity ink cartridges, and lower operating cost.Negatives:* Minimal install of HP software from the CD requires at least 100MB.* Low capacity HP 13 print cartridges ship with the printer.* Power-on, pre-print, and post-print noise, just like the Business Ink Jet 1100d and 1200d.  However, there is very little noise produced while printing.* Cheap plastic cover over the print cartridges, similar to that used on the 1200d.* Large footprint
Works great.Had to remove the brown plastic fitting from the antenna wire that encased the actual metal connector to the cradle.Other reviews pointed this out so it wasn't a big deal, just had to be done carefully.
Everything works great. The only marginal issue is that the batteries don't last a full eight hours. It works in the car but cuts in and out.Guess I have to break down and buy the car kit
I bought this mount for a philips 42" plasma TV.  The TV weighs probably about 100LBs.  I thought the price for it was OK, but i don't know how much an average mount would cost and think the price i paid was pretty good compared to some other mounts.    The mount was put on our living room wall by a "handy man" because i didn't have a stud finder.  He was able to to put the mount on the wall very easily and the assembly was pretty basic.  The mount sits very well secured and the frame of the mount is very durable and strong which leaves me with a good sense that my investment is properly secured.  The 5o tilt function is very nice to have and is being used so the TV sits a little high, but is aimed perfectly and adds a nice presentation to the house.  The room for the input cables is a little small, and causes some cables to be bend a little close to the connector than i would like to see but haven't noticed any degradation in the signal.  None of the cables so far look damaged and will remain that way, so its not of a concern.  I took the cables and made a 1" "trunk" of cables with the power cable and all and video inputs and it seamlessly hangs down the middle to a cabinet with all the accessories.  The TV sits very close to the wall which was a key characteristic of the project even with the 5o tilt.  I rate this item with 5 stars because it is very well made and very strong.  It also looks nice and stays well hidden.  Its features with the 5o tilt work great and the locking bar makes removing the TV easy(I had to take it off the wall to trunk the cables).  I am very very happy with it and would definitely recommend this product
I bought this product to hang a 42" LCD.I am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns.  The mount is only 32" wide.  The "virtual axis" tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a 5 degree tilt which working perfect for me.  There are only two tilt options with this mount, vertical (hugs wall nicely) and the 5 degree.  Being 32" wide you will not hit 3 studs if they are 16" centers.  Make sure you get at least 2 studs.  My experience is this mount does not support VESA 400x800mm pattern.  800mm is ~31.5 inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than ~30 apart.  My TV did have another attaching pattern but I had to use the M5 bolts (provided with mount).  I would feel safer if this mount did support the 800 spacing where I could use the thicker M8 bolts.  A 42" LCD isn't going to weigh as much as a 50"+ TV, so take that into consideration.  I am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy.
My dad and I installed it in just an hour!  It was very.  You can't beat this price.  I found the same mount at Best Buy for over $200!!! 
Great soundcard!  I noticed in Battlefield 2142 that I can hear the sounds of footsteps behind me better.  I'm not getting knifed as often (which is a very good thing!)  I'm glad I got this card
This is absolutely the best mp3 i have ever owned. What makes it the best?1. 16 million color 2.5 LCD touchscreen. 2. Battery life is too good to be true. 52 hours audio 10hr video.3. The best sound, it has how much tweaks, its sick. You can slowdown a song or make it sound like the chipmunks. Has BBE,Wide stereo, enhancement stereo etc.4. The volume is sooo dam loud. I had a Zune and the volume level was at 20, the lourdest it could go. The D2 level is 50 and at 30 it sounds as high as the zune.5. You can encode AVI video bitrate at 1.5mbps.Also have WMV which you can encode at 768kbps.6. No need to install to transfer files, it works like a USB flash drive.7. You can change backgrounds and if you put a black background and your text is black, you can change the text color to 20 difference colors or make you own.8. The touchscreen is smooth and flawless. WHen playing music it tells you the info of the file. example bitrate info, Hz etc. Something that is lacking on the big boys. 9. Has tv output, also has a recorder to record conversations.10. Can view .txt files.11. Can view pics at very high pixels.12. Fm tuner, you can record from the FM radio. You can set the bitrate from low to 256kbps.13. Has a SD slot for more storage. Get a 8 gig SD for a total for 12 gig. Imagine in 2 years when they have 20 gig SD.14. Great support, firmware updates are always available.Plus sooo much more
This particular Cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it, it will blow you away.  I've heard people complain about Dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support, autually their tech support sucks but I don't need them.  This is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully.  When you actually learn how to use it, you won't buy anything else for the price.  If you are tech savey, you will really enjoy the product.  I have nine cams installed at three locations.  Using their IP software you can view upto 16 at once.  The reason I'm back, on this site, is because I need to order two more.  I did have to return my first one but it was a pre-production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear.  Dlink sent my replacement direct.  The oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now.  One last comment, the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay 50% more with less features
I like this printer.  There a few minor quarks, but it's fast and the prints come out good.  The one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight.  If it's lose it will start making bad prints.  It takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out, tighten it and start printing again.I am also using this with the Mac OSX OS.  Though the device says it will only work with PC and mentions something about the CASIO CW Utility for use on a Mac, but no where on the Casio site could I find the mentioned Utility.    After some searching I cam e accross this:[...]This allows the CW-100 to work fine on a Mac.  Though I have never seen the  PC software that comes with printer, I have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options. This is enough to get around, since you can make a JPG version of your label, put that in the print area and print away.  The JPG can be what ever image/text you want.  Resolution is great too.  I print at 300dpi.All in all, I found this to be a great purchase.  I make music and do not have the money to send out to have my CDs done.  This print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost.  Great the DIYer
If you're an anti-commercial radio type this tuner will probably not win you over.  If however you don't like paying a monthly charge for satellite radio and you want something more than just standard AM/FM you might like this tuner. Many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting HD signals.  The quality of HD is most amazing on quiet passages in Classical music, there is no noise at all, very quiet. You do notice!  The HDT-1 is quite sensitive. It will pull in stations that other tuners won't, and I'm not even talking about the HD2 streams that the stations are starting to feature. Clear Channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with HD.  Their stations sound good and most of the FM's are doing HD2, a few have some interesting formats not heard on most AM/FM stations.  I hope the get even more adventurous. My only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get HD to lock in on AM or FM.  I don't believe that to be a fault of the tuner, it's the HD system and just like FM did I'm sure it will improve (ask someone over 50 about FM drift) .  I give it 5 stars, it's not perfect but for the price it's very good and for a first generation product I don't think it could be better than this
This is a great little power strip that allows me to maximize the contents of my briefcase. One of the most useful things I have ever bought for business travelling. Very well made. I would give it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive
Very solid, nice looking shelf, easy to assemble with good instructions and all required pieces included.  It's exactly as I expected it
I have been enjoying these speakers outside by my pool for several months now, and the quality of the sound is excellent, particularly given the reasonable price.  I'm sure you can get better performance, but it will cost much more.  These speakers are a rare find in today's business world -- something that is actually a good deal...
I must admit, the first review posted here on the D320 mademe a little nervous.  My experience is quite different, andafter several months of ownership I am quite pleased.I'll give a point by point rebuttle to the initial review, asthat's the only point of reference (so far):1) Yes, pick up a USB cable,2) Printer driver installation on Win98 essentially required no   user intervention.  With WinXP however, I do seem to recall   having to muck with it more, but I'm hazy on the details now,3) I have printed scores of multi-page documents, many over 15   pages without any problems whatsoever.  I've had no spills   or jams of any kind,4) I have not seen any "paper-curl" problems whatsoever,  5) I leave the paper cassette lid/manual-feed slot in place at   all times as I have no problem with it.  For doing many   two-sided copies, it is indeed easier to place the copies   back into the paper cassette.  But that's my experience with   any copier I've used.6) Making two-sided copies is easy and as efficient as I   expected.  I've simply experienced no problems.7) I've experienced no copier caused misalignments.  If my    copies have been crooked, it was because I set them on the   glass improperly.I am very happy with this unit.  It copies as I expect it to, and prints just the same: quickly and without event.  It's beenable to properly print from all Windoze applications I've thrownat it, and ones many users may not even be using, such asGhostscript, Acrobat, SecureCRT, PAF, and all image viewingsoftware I've tried.  And I've got several machines networkedtogether (Win98 and WinXP) that can all print to the D320 fineusing printer sharing.BTW, the D320 comes with a full, 3500 page toner cartridge too,not a starter unit as with some printers/copiers
I struggled between this and the shure e2c. I decided on the e2c, after comparing also with the etymotics r6i and the ultimate ears superfi3. This one has the least clarity, but wonderful bass. If I don't listen to as much classical music, I'd definitely pick vmoda vibe. It makes even terrible pop songs sound cool.I had to reject it because wearing it was not comfortable for my left ear at all for some reason, and I had an extremely hard time putting it in, even with the help of my bf. The vmoda did not come with any foam, only the silicon ear pieces. I settled on the less bass but more clarity and more comfortable e2c
This is by far the best radio I've ever had for singing in the shower.  No more fumbling and messing with the dial while I've got soap in my eyes... 10 fm presets, 5 am presets and 5 tv presets + weather, I'm always able to find something good to listen to.  It works great for when I'm out in the yard doing some work as well. 
The maps are good enough for navigation of streets and outdoor adventures.  It allows downloading tracks and waypoints from the GPS, editing them and saving to files or the GPS.  It is annoying to have to put the last CD in your drive to use the program
I was programming an Ipod for a friend and became interested in buying one for myself.  I went to the store to get some info on the Ipod, and luckily the departments store I frequent didn't carry the unit, but offered the Zune.  I came straight home, did my reasearch, and ordered on the same day.  The Zune is far more superior than any Ipod model that I have either read about or experienced for myself.  And a much better deal moneywise.  I must say that you shouldn't get a Zune unless you are running a Windows version with SP2 or higher, for any other ver. won't recognize the unit.  I had a pc w/SP1 and Media Center 2002, so I thought I was in trouble.  Against my initial thoughts on SP2, I went ahead and upgraded, and haven't had any problems yet.  The sound is great, videos are decent, and the software is very user friendly.  I would check out the other models of media players, especially the Archos brand, for they have a bigger screen and hard drive.  But for audio and a few videos, this unit is worth the money
I recently purchased the item and knew that some assembly was required. I didn't know that I would be soldering components onto a printed circuit board. That's OK. I was an electronic technician in a former life but it might pose a problem to who might purchase this item expecting a snap together kit
I've had these earphones for about two month and I've discovered the following.  I like the look and they seem to be well made.  The only grip I have is that they are not very loud.  
I love the sound quality and the way I am able to exercise and not notice that I have headphones on.  The headphones don't slide but I have had some difficulty adjusting them for a more snug fit.  Overall, well worth the money
Great product but is only $30 at iriver.com's stor
This is my second set of Garmin radios.  I have had the 120's for a couple years now and had to try out the new 530's.First of all I really like the new color screen and the added features.  The altimeter has been upgraded over the 120's and seems to be more accurate.  My old 120's sitting right next to each other would display different altitudes.  I would not use the data to survey a site but it is more accurate than the older models.  We do a quite a bit of skiing an the altitude displays are helpful when your on the lifts or trying to figure out how many vertical feet you have skied. Especially if your using different lifts and not going all the way to the top.The new compass is also helpful.  With the older models you would have to be moving for the compass to work right.  After calibrating the new compass (turning in a circle) it will work just like a regular compass.  I still carry a regular one in my pack while hiking as a backup, but the compass on the 530 works great and has not let me down.  You can also route off the compass by lining up the sites on the 530 with where you want to go. The 530 will then guide you there and keep you on track if bush whacking and can't see your next way point.As with all the Rino radios the microphone is a little on the weak side.  I really think it's because of the waterproofing that they do.  If you don't put it close to your mouth when speaking it's really not that bad.  I did pick up a pair of throat mics and they have solved any problems at all with clear communications.Lock up problem.  I have experienced this once or twice the first time I used them.  I did the Garmin update and have not had the problem since.Overall these new 530's are GREAT.  I have been using them for close to 2 months every weekend and sometimes during the week.  Now that I have 4 of these (2 120's and 2 530's) these things are a blast to have when we are with a group.  Looking forward to the ski slopes this winter.  We always seem to get separated at some point and never find each other for hours.If you do a lot of outdoor activities or any Geocaching with more than one person these are perfect!![...]
I had researched for a long time before I finally made my purchase. The final reasons for this purchase was the Consumer Reports Best Buy recommendation for the larger 42" version of this Olevia set. I had debated about purchasing a TV with 1080 but decided against doing so when I read that in a set this size that the naked eye could not tell the difference between 1080 and 720. I needed the 37" set due to the entertainment center we already owned, which cost 2.5 times the price of the TV, so it wasn't leaving the house. The TV opening would have allowed a 40" but I am glad I stayed with the 37" because the set-up would have been difficult if not impossible with a 40" because of the need to turn the set at angles. I compared the two TVs at the Olevia site and the only difference was the speakers. I also saw the Olevia at a friend's house and was impressed with the quality. The best price was found through Amazon.com. I placed my order on a Friday evening and the set was delivered by UPS in perfect condition on Wednesday. The set-up of the TV was simple. The only problem I experienced was with the remote. Here's the good news: I sent an email to tech support and quickly I had an answer that was simple to follow and the remote worked perfectly the same evening that I set-up the TV. Even though I use the surround sound through our stereo, I actually was satisfied with the sound through the TV speakers. A small problem is that the Time Warner Cable Box remote control does not operate the TV, so we do have to use multiple remotes, but that's only a minor inconvenience. Our family has been very pleased with the TV. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone purchasing this size TV.
There is not a lot to this device. Simply plug the wire that comes with it into your yamaha amplifier and receiver and away you go. The ipod gets charged, and on my receiver I can even select the song to play via the on-screen GUI on the TV
It is very small and looks very cool.you can charge it very fast.ts sound is very good too.t has radio function too
I purchased the transmitter because I don't have an aux input in my car. The product works well.  I live in an area that is crowded with stations and the transmitter still provided a strong enough signal to override weak stations and provide near quality audio.One review mentioned the Sansa player won't fit in the transmitter with the silicon case on. I use the silicon case to protect my player.  I took off the belt clip that comes with the case.  The player and case fits well enough in the transmitter. 
This CD/DVD holder is sturdy and stylish.  I needed something to look nice, but hold my stuff, and those wallet-type options weren't really cutting it for me.  I had also purchased something similiar (not Case Logic) from another store and was unimpressed by how flimsy it was.I now have 4 or 5 of these and they look great all lined up.  I plan on getting more as needed.  When they get full, it still stays sturdy and fits in the holder (the other one I purchased ballooned out and had to be forced to get it in).The only con I can think of is the price.  For me, it's worth it, but that may not be the case for you if there are budget constraints
I purchased this item on March 15 from Amazon. We've been using it for almost a month now. My wife and I have built our HT system in our Master bedroom (16x14x10) also have 40" Samsung LCD 4095 (1080p) and Polk audio speakers (in ceiling) LC60i for front and middle speakers and RC60i for the surround speakers. I'm awaiting for Toshiba HD-XA2 that was recently ordered to complement our system and would be replacing my current infinity  subwoofer with a HSU STF-2 sub.Originally my first choice was a Pioneer VSX-1016 receiver but with lack of zone 2 and HDMI video pass-thru only. I didn't think it fit our needs. However, Onkyo TX-SR604b not only was a true bargain but it also exceeded my expectations, ease of use (very easy setup) user friendly powerful enough to drive all my polk speakers clean and crisp sound. I did'nt have any problem as far as clicking sound related to HDMI issues like few folks have mentioned on their reviews and I didn't mind running extra component cable to my TV knowing it doesn't up-convert component to HDMI. The only thing that I haven't tested it yet was the zone 2 feature. I'm planning to install my extra pair RC60i in wall speakers to our master bathroom hopefully soon so can't comment on that part yet.Overall we're very pleased with our purchased Thanks AMAZON!
I've used everything from Ableton Live to ProTools to Reason and this thing is just plug and play.  Very easy interface makes for no brainer recording.  I'm a guitarist and the stock sound selections are outstanding.  Most players drive themselves crazy tweaking their sound but as you know it's all about the SONG.  The Sessions software is a piece of cake and makes it incredibly easy to go with your inspiration instead of getting sidetracked trying to figure out all the bells and whistles.  Fantastic product guys and for the money it's a steal
I had an Optoma H27 but felt it was lacking the brightness I liked on TV, and I heard that HD72 was much better.  So I returned my H27 to Costco and got the HD6800, which is Costco's version of the HD72.  Wow, "much better" hardly describes it!  The brightness is incredible, and the detail and colors are truly remarkable.  The other night, I was trying out different DVDs just to see what they looked like on the new system, and I was totally blown away.While it does upscale DVD images to look better on its system, I also bought a Sony upscaling DVD player and there is a significant improvement with it with the HDMI connection.  I had read that since they are both upscaling, the DVD player's upscaling wouldn't be necessary, but I do find the image through the upscaling DVD the best in a side-by-side test using two Sony DVD players and two DVDs of the recently restored "Carousel" using component, s-video, and HDMI at the same time, all connected to the HD72.  I saw clearer detail on faces coming from the HDMI upscaling DVD player.  I was so impressed, I felt like pulling in people from the street to see it, but I fought the impulse because I don't want to share it with anyone.  With a little tweaking of the menus, new films like "Star Wars III" and "Sin City" showed incredible detail, and older films like "The Adventures of Robin Hood" were gorgeous in their Technicolor glory.I highly recommend the HD72.
This is just great for a single VPU video card, the cooling system works great, moving all the hot air outside the CPU. The software overclock is good too, u can change values any time u want and u can select if u want those applied for 3D games only.It works with any game, I've tested it with Oblivion at 1280x1024, HDR enabled and every option at maximum. It works great with F.E.A.R at 1280x1024 with AAx8 and FFA x 4the price is good for a very high end video cards
Unless that I made an order for Terk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A/V Distribution System, I received another wireless system from TERK Co, but the point is that this system is working properly, and right now I'm able to have Greek TV via internet to my desktop, and via the TERK wireless system downstairs to my living-room TV appliance. During the operational time, I saw that I don't have good resolution. I don't know if the reason is because this distance between my office and my living-room (the office is above from the living-room - so there is no big distance at all).But anyway, I will track this equipment, and if everything is ok I will buy one receiver more.Thank you. 
I have purchased over two dozen of these units. This is the best unit for the price. There are a few things that are a real plus one is the small screen on the unit. This allows you to be certain that your feed is being input. Also the card slots are a plus. Two things to be aware of. If you are using the unit in colder temperatures the unit will need to sit and warm up before use. Apparently there is some type of a dew sensor built in. Also if  you are transferring images from a card you have to look at the manual to determine what type of disc is required. Not a one disc does all unit
Works as billed.  I am currently playing a DVD+RL that would not play on any other player.  I have not purchased a 1080P LCD TV, but it is why I purchased an upconverting DVD player.  I have tried DVD+R and DVD+RW.  I will be trying audio formats later.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is waiting for the HD versus BlueRay to determine which will be the dominant technology and for its price to come down
They are great for putting DVD's, CD's in.  They arrive in great condition
I'm not a serious piano player, just casual.  Don't have room for a piano, so this serves my purposes.  I just want to entertain myself.  If I were a professional who played in public, not sure if this would be the ultimate keyboard, because it doesn't have a fullsize keyboard.  But for practicing and casual playing it's great!  It has more features than I will ever use
This is exactly what I was looking for: not too expensive, not much hassle with the cables - they are integrated with the unit, and no need to reach for the button to switch computers - simply press "Scroll Lock" twice to go from one computer to the other. Cables are pretty long, which is good: longer that I need at the moment, but I may appreciate the extra length in the future.
Great features with the Microsoft mouse.  Wanted at least a 4 button mouse so internet travel is much easier. Comes with a USB dongle that I did not want to use so I was determined to get this mouse working with the built-in Bluetooth in my new Dell Latitude notebook.  Found that the Toshiba drivers provided by Dell for the Bluetooth would not work with the Microsoft mouse.  Seems still some incompatibility with different manufactures of Bluetooth devices.  Go figure....  Had to delete the Toshiba drivers and let XP with SP-2 provide the drivers and it works great. Pros: Great features, no cord, long battery life between charges (days), very responsive.Cons:  Some difficulty getting it to work without supplied dongle, bigger than I like to pack around for a notebook.
A great and economical replacement! This product saved me a lot of money. The red in the color leaked a tiny bit in shipment but cleaned up and worked with no problem
The Azden transmitter-receiver system has operated marvelously well for me over scores of interviews. As an aspiring video maker it was a product I should have bought a long time ago. Mine is the 9v-powered model, not the AA. But it has proven well-made, light and easy to use. There's something neat about micing people with a lavaliere unit. I find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping.  Being able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience. Another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise. The din of voices surrounding your interview is a typical intrusion; using the lavaliere cuts out a great deal of the unwanted sonic information. 
It works very well.  It's nice to be able to listen to CD's in my car without getting a whole new stereo system installed.  My only problem is that the CD player will turn off every once in a while when the power cord is bent.  This happens rarely, but it's enough to be a little annoying.  Other than that, it's a very nice product.  No skipping, easy to use and a fair price
I got this product when I first signed up to Telewest Broadband and it has never failed. I have had it for 2 years and not a problem. I started at 512kbps and they've upgraded me to 4Mbps and it handles that speed without a problem. Perfect for your light, moderate or heavy user, good all-rounder.Thanks for reading :
This product has good and bad points. I listed some below:Good---------Cheaper than Apple ($5 as compared to $30)Works greatSmallConvienientBad---------Cheap (might not hold up long term)No warranty coverage for your iPod is something goes wrongHas to be plugged in upside down (for me anyway...)Overall, I'm glad I bought this instead of Apple's version. The main factor for me was price, but if you have the money, get the Apple charger, simply because you'll be covered by warranty that way
Just make sure you buy the right drive for your computer and download the software from Western Digitals website you should have no problems.Very nice
I love this remote.I was afraid that having a NON-TIVO brand unit (Toshiba brand TIVO unit) would require lots of setup (testing dozens of codes before finding the right one).Mine worked just as soon as I put batteries into the unit.The buttons are quite intuitive; I never used the user's manual yet.A real winner.An inexpensive replacement for the real unit
We installed this external HD on a Dell computer. As most Dell customers will attest to, any time you talk to one of their representatives, they'll deny compatability with anything other than a Dell product. Well, I have upgraded the video card, power supply, and now added this HD to the computer with very liitle effort. This HD has performed perfectly for us.
When I got my hands on the PMC-120 I thought this was going to to be the best player but when I started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way.I agree with the other reviews that it has a first generation-device feel to it. MUSIC:When I tried to put music in my PMC it syncronized  my mp3s with the WMP 10 with no problem (very fast). If U are looking for a grab and drop (copy/paste) your music mp3 device, this is not for you because when I did  it got everything in one same folder that read "Unknown artist and album". So you have to put all your mp3s via WMP 10, wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast. The problems that I encountered is that it only has one "Portable playlist"  and sometimes when Im playing an mp3 and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button.One cool thing is that it shows the cd covers  without having to put them in. This is done via the WMP10.The sound is very good and crisp, and the equalizer setups are fair.But you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound.PICTURES:This is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders. You can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a PC to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you.VIDEO:Ok, now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me...I wanted a portable media device that I would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid.  I knew that this device only reads WMV but it "supports" DIVX, XVID, MPEG, etc. This "support" deppends on what the WMP10 can play. So this means that you sincronyze (via WMP10) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into WMP movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your PMC secreen size.  I had this in mind when I bought it and was fine with me untill I tried it the first time: The WMP10 wouldnt convert my XVID movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that I had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the WMP10. So after uninstalling and installing I was good to go so I converted a 1:45hr long movie in only 25 minutes.  But this short moment of joy  was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the WMP10 fits the widescreen movies into the PMC and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable!!!! You cant change this because the WMP does this automatically.  My answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into WMV files. The problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert...I have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the WMP10.In the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the WMP10 and it does it very fast and with good quality.You can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so I think this option is useless on the PMC.So the veredict is: The PMC-120 is a good  multimedia player with minor glitches. It is a little bulky but personally I think the size is not that big. I think the good side of the size issue comes along with its  big 3.6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video. If you want to play directly your DIVX or XVID movies on your player buy another porduct like the iRiver PMP series or the Archos players wich are way, way, WAY more expensive.So I think that for the price and for what it does the PMC-120 gets two thumbs up.
I bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me! So far it does what it's suppose to do.  I am pleased. It's a little clunky, and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended. We'll see how it works in 6 months
THis is a great drive for your money if you use Mac, Windows, and Linux. I use all of them and it works great, I do wish that they had an 8 Gig versions out, but this one will do for now
I am kind of a shortwave junkie, and have a few radios all over the place,I must admit that for the money spent, and the performance and endurance, this little bugger is probably my best buy!  I cannot believe the sound quality or the reception, its phenominal!  I can pick up shortwave inside the meat packing plant where I work!  (Big heavy steel freezers) It is a simple, small no frills, pocket size radio, but it blows away anything in its price range, trust me
Same HP burner/player that is $30 or more in the local stores.Installation was fast and easy.Nero software installed fast, very little info on the Nero products,to play dvd you need to install the Cyber DVD player on the Nero disk.
I love this product.  The earbuds were even better than I had expected.  I wanted something small that wouldn't hurt my ears and I wanted a long cord and that is just what I got. I am very happy with the product and the service.Thank yo
I travel overseas a lot for my job. This little power strip is compact and enables you to keep ONE adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your "normal" plugs for operating four devices. Most Monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money (wires, cables, etc.) but this gizmo rocks
I picked this up to use on a Mediterranean cruise since the outlets in cruise ship cabins are scarce and usually located right at the edge of a vanity.  It worked great for charging 2 digital camera batteries which wouldn't fit in the normal outlet at the same time.  It's small, rugged and light so it's easy to pack
Having a bad view of the southern sky, I needed to get a outdoor antenna for my sirius radio.It maded all the difference. Great product and it came with 30 ft. of cable
A very good product, but the fantastic part is sirius radio itself. Howard rules!
I don't know what the fuss is all about about this unit's "fan noise"... After the firmware update, if one bothers to do o it, the fan noise level is really trivial compared to advantages of HUGE storage space (or data redundancy if one should choose to use RAID 1). The sound of the fan is about as loud as a fan from a PC workstation (one of those DELL Precisions or MacPro/PowerMacs).One of the things I wish could be different about the unit is if the RAID configuration could be more easily managed by using Apple's Disk Utility instead of using WD's own proprietary software (which requires a reboot... an annoying thing on Mac OSX.4 which I almost NEVER EVER have to reboot). And then the button manager requires yet another reboot before the functionality can be fully utilized... HELLO, Western Digital... Mac is no Microsoft Windows where users are used to rebooting often! If you want more of Mac users' business, write your apps like a true OSX app... At most I should be able to just log out and then log back in to use the functionalities... Other than that, the unit is a work horse. I use SuperDuper to backup my Mac and so far have had no issues at all with it...
I bought this drive from PCuniverse on Amazon and I am generally happy with the service I received and product quality, I have not used it for long time yet but have managed to fill up most of the drive. The speed looks good even over wireless network. I also like the Truecrypt encryption software bundled which is actually freeware; seems to be quite capable an usable with any drive (USB flash or disk drive, look at [...]It seems much better than the software that comes with many flashdrive in terms of capabilities. I am surprised that there is not a lot of competition in the 8GB flash business yet possibly because people don't need it. I had a Corsair 1GB drive from 2 years back and it worked quite well; upgraded to 8GB as my data requirement grew
I've owned this item for almost a full year and I am extremely pleased with it. It's so nice being able to carry around my laptop and my books in the same bag. The side pockets are kind of useless for them being so small, but I guess I'll be able to find a purpose for them.
Ordered directly from HP. Fast delivery,solid package. No dead pixel. Works perfec
I muchly recommend suggest buying purchasing these batteries power sources in the pre-tried used section. You can save pay less for them these that way. But be warned aware, used pre-tried batteries is may be no good since they is not may be rechargedable
All electronics should work this easily.  You hook it up, read the manual, play with it alittle bit and it works like a charm.  I've been using two (home desk and car player) for 5 years now.  They just seem to last forever
This watch is great because the countdown is so easy to use.  Whenever I need to remember to check the dryer or the stove, all I have to do is push one button to the number of minutes I want to wait.  Its the only watch I wear and I never take it off.  I even swim with it on.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is so plain.  I wish Casio would make it in a pretty color
Great product that works exactly as described. I have not used this as a stand-alone label maker; I've only used it with my computer. The software is fairly easy to use, and it will pull data from an Excel spreadsheet, which is a definite plus. I had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which I needed to make labels, and linking to the Excel doc made the process very quick and convenient. The only complaint I have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey. I spent $40 on the label maker, and so far I've spent $60 on tape
The lable maker was removed from the box and put into action with ease.  Product is easy to use and understand.  For the money a great purchase.
I purchased this as a gift for my 56-year-old mother who simply can't get enough Scrabble with her friends. While I did not get the opportunity to use the product myself, she seems quite enthusiastic about its abilities.Just make sure your opponents approve and dont think you are trying to cheat.
I have multiple cameras, and one of my favorite features is that this reader can support multiple types of cards plugged in at one time.  If you have a SD card and a CF card, both can be inserted and read/written to without having to switch out the cards.  Very nice reader for a great price.  The Blue LED is very pleasant to look at.
I would give this 5 stars but for a few things:- the included earbuds are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears during  exercise- syncing is sometimes buggy- you have to load all podcasts manually- podcasts seem to be ordered by date on the player, no matter how you  arrange them in iTunesRecent releases of iTunes have solved some, but not all, of the sync issues. Also, I have read about some workarounds for the podcast ordering problem, but they involve rebuilding your library, and furthermore from what I've read they're just temporary fixes. Apple needs to fix this.Still, the small form factor, cool design, and easy-to-use controls make this a great product. I sold my 4G 40GB iPod right after I got this, and I have no regrets.
This card is significantly cheaper (at the time I ordered) than the Sandisk Extreme III at the same speed (133x).  I was expecting to receive a 100x since it was listed as that in the description but the 133x came and I was very happy.  Works as advertised and Kingston is a reliable memory brand.  Product came quickly
Outstanding cleaner for your CD or CDRW, MP3 player.  Takes you through many diagnostic tests.  Even has a Dolby test.  Well worth the money and you will be more than pleased with it.  I used it on both my PC CD and CDRW drives as well as my stereo CD player.  Fantastic product!!
The design for this headset is ingenious. Every piece is separated so you can mix and match for your convenience. It's not really a headset, but a headphone with a detachable headset; so you can use it to chat online or listen to your mp3 player. The microphone can even be mounted independently onto your computer monitor with the included base. The extension cord comes with a volume controller, another very convenient feature. There are also little hangers on the extension cord, which are for attaching the microphone cord. The audio quality is pretty good, throw in 20 bucks more to get the combo set, which includes a sound card to enhance the audio quality.****The only thing I have to complain about is the comfort issue. Maybe it's the size of my head, but the earpieces simply press a little bit too hard against my temples, so it causes mild headache after 30 minutes of usage. Other than that, this headset is perfect
I'm so technically challenged, and I had no trouble figuring out this system.  I already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it. Altogether they were a bit pricey, but worth every penny!  Very easy to understand the directions, and lots of bells and whistles.  Lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description.  I love the intercom features, they are great for when the kids are upstairs, I don't have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them.  Very cool
I couldn't believe how lightweight this monitor is, and how easy it was to connect to my computer. It is one of the best investments I have made this year. What a difference the LCD screen makes for my vision. Its wonderful.  I highly recommend this monitor to anyone who is looking for something easy to connect and have excellent quality as well. It is the perfect monitor for me
This watch is not only the best watch I have ever owned, it is the only day time watch that I ever use.  I love the 1,3,5,10,20, 30 minute timer found ONLY on this watch.  I love it so much that I buy several and change out the band to match different outfits!  I do wish that this watch came in a more dressy version.  I also hope that Casio continues to make this watch for people who need a timer and a dependable alarm
I bought this deck about 6 months ago. It has performed flawless in every aspect. As soon as I turned it on I could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck. I have taken all of my cd's out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface. The ipod function is flawless and easy to use. Just plug in your ipod and search by artist, album, song title or playlist. This can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so I would suggest using playlists. The output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing. Also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs, this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment. This deck is the best overall I have ever listened to
I've had this printer for four years. I print approximately 25 documents each week. This is the first time that I have had to replace the cartridge. It's a great little printer and this cartridge lasts a good long time, too. Compared to ink jet printers that I have had, I get about 5 times as many prints from this laserjet -- and the price of the cartridges is about the same as the ink jets.Great buy
Firstoff, that first review about the format capacities is outright wrong.  Let me explain how this works.The soundstage program that the player uses is a lot like iTunes; it has its own proprietary format that is really just MP3 with a different file extension title.  When you import your MP3s into the soundstage library, it makes its own DUPLICATE library of your music in a new directory using its 'OMG' file suffix.  Yes, OMG.  I think that's funny, and you should too.The minidiscs themselves are essentially just CD-RWs.  Keep this in mind.  They are enjoyable cheap to buy more, they are rewritable, and they hold 80 minutes of basic cd-audio, or close to 4/5 hours of 'low bitrate' audio, which is just compressed MP3s.  The product itself is very good.  I've had one for a short while.  I bought an eight-pack of disks right after I got it, and filled them with music.  I have six full discs of labeled artists and find that disc-swapping of five-hour playlists is FAR less irritating than my old cd-player method; CD-swapping with 70-minute albums.  The controls are VERY simple and effective.  Grouping your tracks makes them easier to navigate, but you can otherwise go through all the tracks you have as if it were an audio-CD.  Its impeccably shockproof, and my only severe grievance is the lack of a backlight.  The hold switch works fine and the unit is small and light.I got this as an alternative to harddrive MP3 jukeboxes.  Most MP3 players over a gig in capacity are HD storage, which is far less durable (in my experience) than simpler players.  Rather than settle for a 256 or 512 mb player that I would have to swap on my computer constantly, I got the minidisc player and can simply take other disks with me.  Its a solution that suited me well
I've owned 2 sets of these types of phone systems.  A GE set and a 2.4 gig Uniden set.  This is by far the best.  Actually, it's perfect.  No noise on the line at all.  Everything just works perfectly.Only one caution. This particular model does not have an answering machine.  I was moving too fast when i bought and thought that it did.  If you want an answering machine to come with, make sure you buy the right model.  I'm totally sold on the DECT 6.0!!!!Buy it.  You won't regret it.  
Very nice player. HDMI works perfectly and the 6 disc changer is handy. Blue light lets you see the disc's and looks very cool. 1080i with upscaling on all my DVDs.
I recently bought and installed this radio in my truck, and I have not had any problems yet!!!  A few minor details are the noise blanker seems really sesitive (sometimes when it is on I do not receive any traffic) but that is about it.  I enjoy Cobra products, this is my second radio (I just traded up from a 25NWXT), I have a Cobra HG2000 Antenna, and I am waiting on a Cobra Mic for my radio.  So far no problems with any of it and I hope to have none down the road!!!!
I've had my Cobra 29 for over five years now. It's been in four different trucks, and traveled over 500,000 miles with me. Once I added two wilson antennas and a power mic, I can get out over four miles on a good night. My personal record is a line of sight 130 miles from a mountainside. I love it. I was thinking of getting a galaxy, but why? I have a great radio here
    After doing some research and owning a cheaper shredder model,  I decided to purchase this shredder.  So far it was a wise decision.  I have seen it elsewhere for a lot more money.  I have been using it to shred up all my old and new personal documents and it is awesome.  I put a kitchen garbage bag in the can and it keeps all the little paper pieces contained within the bag, and I can just keep reusing the same bag. It really is a smooth shredder and it keeps on working, no jams, etc.  Great Buy!
There is just one word to describe this product: amazing. I'm full satisfied with it. Just buy it with 1Mbytes (mine is 512kBytes). One last thing: the battery lasts forever
I went from the first version of the Audigy2 to this. And it did increase my performace a tiny bit. My old card was going out on me. A lot of pops and clicks and games locking up with sound skipping. Haven't had any of that yet. :)I also didn't seem to have the MB problems that were stated in first review. I have a ASRock Dual-VSTA(new one made for Windows:Vista).With a good Stereo setup this card sounds really nice. I have a older but really nice 5.1 with 100watts for each speaker. Only 4 years old, but have seen some really nice ones lately.A lot of new games coming out have intense sound now. Vanguards sound has crappy options so you can't dumb it down and it can drag a system down, esp one using on board sound.I would give this a 4 or even 3 star rating if it included Amazons rating too. [...
FANTASTIC sound for the money!  (seems to work well with Asus P5W DH, anyway)  Nice crisp highs, decent mid-range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick, IMO.  The only down-side I could find is some of the nonsense-software included is, well, nonsense.  Creative scores, again
Buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days, but I still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again.Used to have one years ago...now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer.The equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer.It allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer
I use this scanner primarily for text documents and couldn't be more impressed.  You do need text software - I have Textbridge - but I find relatively few errors in the scan, proofreading and corrections are easy and efficient.  Best of all, I don't have another device plugged into my computer or taking up space on my desk.  Caution - I haven't used it for photos, but it does a great job on text
This mouse has never let me down. Really works on most of the surfaces
This is a wonderful album, that evokes memories of the 60's folk boom, yet contains original songs. I was amazed at the fantastic harmonies and musical arrangements.Anyone who loves the movie "A Mighty Wind" and who loves folk music will fall in love with this album. I know I did
On one hand, this CD is a straight ahead instrumental rocker, but Johnny A really shows how great he is with ballads, such as his covers of "Wichita Lineman," and "Yes it Is."  In fact, those two ballads alone are worth the price of the CD by themselves.But Johnny A can flat kick your ass, too.  He's a biker and his tunes like Oh Yeah, In the Wind and Two Wheel Horse are named for his other hobby.  And they rock, but there's nothing cliched or tired in his style.  He always seems to be looking for new ways to say something.  I saw him in person at the Triple Door in Seattle sometime in February 2005 in a power trio format and he played most of the tunes on this album.  The guy is one amazing guitar player.  He played his signature Gibson hollow body, fitted with a vibrato tailpiece (Bigsby? It was like the old Chet Atkins "country gentleman" model) and he utilized a battery of foot pedal effects, coming eventually through a pair of Marshall combo amps.  The guy had some of the best clean tones I've ever heard from anyone, anywhere.Basically, Johnny A is a guitarist who has complete command of the instrument.  And he's got a rocking soul that cuts loose on originals and covers alike in a style that's all his own, and that's saying something these days.  If you love great rocking/rockabilly guitar, combined with really cool ballad playing in the power trio format, this CD is just what you're looking for.  In fact, I guarantee you'll be knocked out.Five stars. 
this band reminds me of the thrill i first got when i listened to an Atreyu Album. It dies today rip off the former bands style, but they are still a very good band.  In the over-crowded metalcore market of today, that is a rarity.  My only complaint, is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice (as heard on "The Radiance), but more often then not goes for the screams and growls that are associated with this type of music. still 5/5 material though.Favorite songs: "The Radiance," "Freak Gasoline Fight," "Our Disintigration," and :THe Caitliff Choir:Defeatism
Like I said I would, I finally got around to purchasing this CD. I especially like tracks 9-12. Cheap Trick is solid as always. I have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases. If I do have any criticism at all, it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled Trick riffs. I guess it's hard to create new stuff after 30+ years. Anyway, there are some great tunes on this. Buy it like I did!
Ok good CD. im not suprised. Ok jaheim may not have the b best voice but his music is good and it goes will with the voice that he has.  Yes yall this album does use profanity but the songs actually have meanings. I like that daddy thing song, and like a dj. This album looks at issues from a mans  point of view. Ya know we've heard the angry woman and how the man did t his and that now jaheim looks at it from a males view. Ok yall i know he is not the first one to do this but he did it well. Also this is a break from that [...] that is played on the radio.
Review by Mike Watson:With the recent slew of Victory Records releases, not to mention the wide variety; one can be to say the least skeptical of any of their assortment of new releases.  However, picking through all of the less notable releases from the label, the up-and-coming band, The Forecast, have stepped to the plate and scored a home run on Late Night Conversations.  The Forecast are a perfect blend of male and female vocals over a very modern rock soundtrack, executed flawlessly over a ten song full length.Late Night Conversations is an album confronting different topics ranging from relationships to the teen trend of mutilation and loathing.  The harmonies arranged by both vocalists are undeniably catching and well written and the music follows closely in suit leaving your head bobbing back and forth to the beat and your feet tapping almost involuntarily. The Forecast is not only a great recorded band, but bring the same toe tapping energy to the stage, with both great stage presence and cohesion as a band.  The Forecast will defiantly be one of the new big bands in poppier rock music, and checking their Victory Records debut out is a must for fans of the genre.
great anniversary present. fav song... I love the way you love me... my husband loves to listen to it in the car
As we all know by now, Lil' Jon is not known for his lyrical capabilities, but for his platinum productions and ability to find guest artists perfect for his songs.  He is truly the king of crunk.  Many of the songs on the album are much like the hit single, "Get Low" feat. The Ying Yang Twins- strong pumping dacefloor beats, lots of swearing and yelling constantly Yeeah!, Whuut?, and Okaay!  Buying the edited version (if there is one) would be a total waste.  This album is not for the meek or faint hearted!  Much of the songs hardly have many words from Lil Jon himself, mostly from the featured artists.  These include Petey Pablo, 8Ball and MJG, Chyna Whyte, Pastor Troy, Jadakiss, Styles P., ect.My faveorites1) Throw it up w/ Pastor Troy- a 'hood representing song with a thumping beat2) Get Low3) Rep Yo City w/ Petey Pablo, Bun B- a very good song with talents all around4) Knockin' Heads Off- again Jon struts his stuff5) I Don't Give A...- perfect for before game pumping musi
Relationships and drug use are major themes.  This album starts off with two absolute killer tunes, lets down some but has a joy thoughout.  I can't believe this is going to be his only album.....what a shame.  From someone who has been listening to rock for a long time, I tell ya, this is a blast.  Pure fun.  Something you might want to give to someone you have broken up with as its full of a broken heart and the joy of being in love.....mostly rather quickly paced.  One of my favorite albums of the 90s.  More people should listen
I didn't think it was possible for the Delays to top their debut release - but they have. While "Faded Seaside Glamour" is more immediately catchy and refined, "You See Colours" comes at you in a much more intense manner. The songs are more mature, the musicianship is top-notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom-end and soaring harmonies. The high points for me are Valentine and Winters Memory Of Summer, but there's honestly not a bad track on this release. The Delays put it all together - great songwriting, strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre-bending mix that has something for everybody. It's a shame these guys don't get more recognition here in the States. Buy it
Just lay back and listen. Brian Wilson never misses a note. His voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop. His composing and arranging skills are without peer and he even plays some awesome bass (the slow middle eight section on Wouldn't It Be Nice)on this album. These songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling  both excited and uncertain. Recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the Beach Boys themselves, this is a true pop magnum opus. The best tracks are the gorgeous You Still Believe In Me, Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder), the title cut, and the tear inducing Caroline No. Instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity, Brian Wilson invites you into his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that haven't aged a day since 1966. The more you listen to Pet Sounds, the more it's beauty envelopes you
If you like vocalese, then this cd is for you.  The song selection and performances are excellent.  In my opinion, it stands up with the best Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross stuff.  It is clear that a lot of love and effort went into the making of this record.  Buy and enjoy
   I can honestly say that when I first heard Scarling's "So Long, Scarecrow", I was less than impressed. I've been into Scarling for a few years now, and when I heard their first record,"Sweet Heart Dealer", I instantly fell in love. I somewhat held it above everything else, I was so impressed by it. So when I heard the progression from SHD to SLS, I was a little bit let down.   But after three solid listens, from first to last, I was totally amazed by this record. It was like something clicked and I was able to see the beauty each track held. I seriously listen to this CD almost everyday. Although I prefer some tracks to others [(Northbound on) Cauhenga!], I really can't think of one track that I just don't like. It now takes place in my favorites over SHD.  I feel that this record can really appeal to anyone; it's very versatile. And, as always, Jessicka's beautiful vocals compliment the indescribable amazingness of the music wonderfully. If you're indecisive about purchasing this record, I say bite the bullet, give it a few solid listens, and promptly be blown away
This is a wonderful, fun and soothing CD!  It will relax children and parents will enjoy it even after the 100th listen!!  My husband is a musician and he loves both of the Dan Zanes CDs we have.  This will now be a gift I give to all my friends and family when they have a baby
There is a saying in the construction industry "Tripping over dollars to pick up nickels." Or in the regular world "Can't see the Black Forest for the trees."I doubt if there IS an definitive rendition of all of Beethoven's symphonies. Even the composers own conducted versions changed over time and from performance to performance depending on the players or his intentions. Instruments were constantly changing and you know this guy was never satisfied, always stretching. We can only guess what his EXACT intentions would be today or tomorrow. What you want to remember is:1) The first version of anything you seriously like will color your listenings of subsequent versions. You'll be listening for qualities that aren't there and missing qualities that are there.2) Different versions bring us different views. Isn't that a good thing? Sound in all it's forms is preferable than a useless search for the best sound. I'd rather have that kind of an attitude than the bickering negative perfectionist snob attitudes of some of the reviewers here.Having said that... I love these versions. I've had them for some time. I have at least 4 versions of the symphonies. These are clear, well recorded, dynamic and straight forward. Beethoven's passion, mental range and personal warmth are within. You can easily hear the information that Beethoven wanted you to hear. Probably better than he could. No make that clearly better than he could. Ha ha!These are solid, lovely, beautiful, and astounding. Listen to them
This album sparked the so-called "Neo-Soul" movement years before it was adopted by other artists. Back in early 1986 everything was about synthesizer overkill and Prince broke the music back down to its roots. This concept was later used by Tone Tony Toni, Brand New Heavies, and D'Angelo.

This has to be one of the most beautiful CDs ever recorded. Damien's vocal range is vast; his musicianship excellent; but it's the crafting of songs at which he truly surpasses most artists. Haunting, sensitive, flowing, crashing...  (If I have one criticism, it's the mixing levels - at times, his vocals are drowned. In concert, when he lets rip, you really feel the power of his vocals/music, which, unfortunately, doesn't come over quite as well on the album.) A truly magical album.
A friend loaned me her CD and I absolutely loved it......but I could not purchase it ANYWHERE.....my daughter suggested I contact you.....results, results!!!! Thank you!  A most outstanding seasonal soft listening CD
I had tears in my eyes when I first heard this album. I get emotional over music I really like, and this album got to me.So many great standards so well delivered by the duo. They deliberately chose slower ballads for this album so don't look for uptempo,snappy songs in this one.Not that Harry Warren could not write faster stuff like Jeepers Creepers,Shuffling Off to Buffalo etc. This album is to sing along with softly or hum.I kept thinking of Bogart in the rain in Casablanca and other lovers in W.WII.I know the main tune in that movie was not by Harry Warren;it simply reminded me of great love tunes from that era by Julie Styne[Time After Time] and the grossly underrated Harry Warren.Grab someone you love, some good wine and savor one of the great popular composers and a great duo.They should do more Harry Warren albums,Michael and George.I thank them profusely
Poison the Well are one of those bands that I was really big on right when I first started listening to them, but which faded a lot pretty quickly.  I can't really say why.  I like their work, but it doesn't inspire me the way it used to.  Still, I do like them, and this album particularly.  Maybe not as much as Opposite of December, but whatever.  Yes, this isn't as 'hardcore' as their older stuff, but I've never been hardcore kiddie.  (I'm a metalhead)  And frankly, being a modern hardcore band ain't much of a compliment in my book.  It's funny, lotsa tech-metalcore and other 'core derived bands are good, but most straight hardcore/metalcore is staggeringly boring.  So, while old PTW was semi-technical metalcore, this album is pretty much just extremely loud emo.  But, they now how to be 'emotional' and not come across as sissies,(well, most of the time) and Jeff doesn't sing in an unbearably affected manner.  Course, the 'extremely loud' part helps a lot too, and Jeff's growls/screams are absolutely devastating.  Way  better than on their previous albums, and some of the best extreme vox from anyone, ever. As an extremely heavy emo album, the instrumentation here is pretty bland.  There isn't much real riffing going on, not in the metal sense anyway, mostly just a single  note/chord repeated a great many times, than another one etc.  But, the vox and atmospherics carry the day.  The standout track is 'Crystal Lake', an absolutely bestial piece of deathcore.  I've listened to quite a bit of death metal in my day, but this has got to be one of the most devastating tracks I've ever heard, largely because of the absolutely impassioned vox.  Lotsa extreme vox lack emotion, but never Moeria's (probably spelling that wrong, sorry)  That, and the instruments are more noteworthy, very nasty and chaotic.  Also, it earns points for taking some of the seriousness out the genre with its jokey lyrics. (For the culturally backward, this song is a first-person narrative from Jason Voorhees, killer of most of the 'Friday the 13th' films.  Hence the name 'Crystal Lake'.)There are no truly weak tracks here.  'Ghostchant' is a good opener, nicely displaying the extreme tonal dichotomy of the album, mixing the fierce screams with some nice melodic vox.  'Loved Ones' is one of the very best tracks, again carried almost entirely by the powerful  vox.  Tracks 5 is a cool two part thing  mixing the rather pleasant, harmonica and bass driven intro with one of the more hectic, grinding main songs.  The album takes a turn for the lighter at about track 8.  'Apathy is a Cold Body' is a very emo-y track, but it's got a lot of nice melody to it, so it works.   'Sound like the End of the World' is another strange one.  It's a slow doomy piece with oppressive atmosphere and a thick layering of vocal lines.  Not the best thing here, but it works and it earns some points for being different.Yes, a solid, if not great album.  Check it out
this cd is really really good. warped tour never fails to please.  the best songs are by these people...the used, YELLOWCARD, story of the year, matchbook romance, the early november, avoid one thing, taking back sunday, audio karate, simple plan, maxeen, coheed and cambria, and mest.  BUY THIS C
Wonderful instrumentals and lyrics.  A Shenandoah Lullaby is simply beautiful.  I love the way the ending segues into Brahm's lullaby.   His version of Arkansas traveller is refreshing.  Teddy Bears' Picnic is a quaint song that few people have heard.  There Ain't No Bugs On Me is my two-year-old daughter's favorite, judging from the way she belts out this song and giggles from time to time.  I like all the songs on the CD.  A breath of fresh air for parents who prefer real instruments to synthesized pop.
I rarely write reviews of music but feel that I must share my impressions of this CD.  I have long heard some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of Townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records.  I finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers--Lyle Lovett-"Lungs" (among others) and Steve Earle-"Tecumseh Valley".  I was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording.  Other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other Townes' records.  I come from a different angle.  As someone who has long heard Townes sopken of with the highest praise, I can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings.  I will also say that I am deeply frustrated that I never took advantage of the chance to see Townes perform while he was alive. 
Without a doubt, the highlight is the DVD of the 1975 show in London.  "Born to Run," the album, had put him on the cover of "Time" and "Newsweek" the same week in October, 1975, one of the very few times that has happened for a non-news story.  The publicity and hype generated by Columbia records was so overwhelming that there was a backlash:  "Nobody can be that good."  So here we see his first show ever in the UK, playing to an audience of professional critics and amateur skeptics, people thinking, "hey, 'Rock and Roll Future,' this is the land of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who - who do you think you're kidding.  No unknown kid from America deserves 'Time' and 'Newsweek.'"The show begins in almost total darkness, a piano softly plays, then harmonica, and a soft spotlight lights the kid from New Jersey who sings "Thunder Road," accompanied by only piano.  An unknown song at the time, "Thunder Road" has become a Springsteen classic.  IMHO, especially given the expectations, it is a perfect understated opening.  The DVD has the entire show, including everything from the hard rock of "She's the One," and "Born to Run," the song, to a much slowed down version of "For You," an underated sleeper on his first album, "Greeting From Asbuty park, NJ."  Bruce accompanies himself on the piano and I swear, this version of "For You" is so beautiful it could be the scruffy New Jersey kid channeling god.Any skeptic who walked out of this show thinking Springsteen was merely hype has no ears, no taste, or was xenophobic.  The show gives more than a big hint that this Springsteen guy is for real, as a songwriter and performer, and that "Born to Run," especially, is an extraodinary album. There are only eight songs, but none are fill.  Repeated listenings of the four corners of the album (before CDs) "Backstreets," "Jungleland," Thunder Road," and the title song are so good they become... well, addictive, works of genius, and lead to still more listening.  "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out," "Night," and especially "She's the One" could each be the centerpiece of almost any other album.  Even the whispered "Meeting Across the River," fits and helps the album become a coherent whole.  The songs taken together are more than the sum of the parts.As a footnote I'll offer the opinion that Bruce only wrote one other album that is as good as "Born to Run" and that is his next one, "Darkness on the Edge of Town."  Everything he has released is good;  a good bit of it is great, but I don't think anything else matches "Born To Run" or "Darkness."  I don't know if two other back to back albums this good have ever been released.  The DVD of the show gives us a big early peek at the guy who would develop into rock's greatest performer.  By 1985 he would be the biggest rock star in the world, selling out multiple nights at football stadiums.The remastered CD is nothing special to my ears.  Perhaps an audiophile could hear improvement.  The DVD, "The Making of 'Born to Run,'" is interesting, but will probably appeal mainly to fans.  However the DVD of the 1975 London show ought to appeal to anyone who likes Bruce, or rock  roll, or showmanship, or history.  Its a treat
Thoroughly enjoyed the CD.  Have some of the songs as performed by other artists, but it's nice to hear them as performed by the writer.  I'm always impressed by one with that kind of creativity.
This outstanding effort by Prince consists of mostly spare jazzy R tunes, driven by incredibly loose, free-flowing live instrumentation.  I could only begin to tell you about the stylistic variety on this album.  With the three disc format there is a lot to absorb, and the third disc really can largely be done without, but the first two truly do rank amongst his best work.  It should also be noted how especially romantic Prince is on this album.  This album was made around the time that he entered into his first marriage, and it shows because this c.d. is overflowing with outstanding romantic ballads.  Most of his albums only contain one or two ballads, so if you've been longing for an album that includes more, then this album should really appeal to you.  This c.d. does not fit into the "standard" Prince "mold" ( I know that it is perhaps a bit oxymoronic to speak of a "Prince mold" but his personal signature is not quite as bold on this album as it is on many of his other works, even those that are admittedly not as good).  The reason for this is that Prince follows rather than leads on a good portion of this album.  The fact that there are two covers on the first disc alone shows that Prince was in the mood to do what was being done instead of doing something new (he covers songs by Bonnie Raitt and The Stylistics) which is unsual for this constant innovator, but this album is so great because he is so skillful that he does it better than almost anyone else.  One minor problem that I notice is that it seems that on a few songs particularly on the first disc, Prince just doesn't pay much attention to the lyrics.  There are too many generic R come-ons and cheesy cliche 90's catch phrases such as "gettin' your groove on', and Prince is much too clever, witty, and creative to resort to such things. But, really that is just a minor quibble because the music truly is consistently outstanding throughout the first two discs.  And then, he has songs such as "Soul Sanctuary" and "Let's have a baby" which are two of the most well-written ballads that I've heard from him.  "In this bed I scream" is just magnificent both lyrically and musically.  He takes the lead again on this track and he does it in a major way.  This clever, poetic, and romantic track has an infectiously catchy both rhythm and melody that would easily pack any dance floor.  Other highly impressive moments include the high powered funk of "We gets up", the absolutely brilliant and stunning arrangement on "Curious Child", and the sincere, pure passion of the just so perfect R/gospel blend of "Savior".  "Joint 2 Joint" is impressive just for having so much variety in terms of sounds and elements, with each part so effectively enhancing a different part of the story. The first two discs are really solid overall.  The third disc however finds Prince trying his hand at techno and other forms of conventional dance/club music, and the results are not very impressive.  But, I don't see how they could be, even coming from Prince.  Techno for the most part is insanely repetitive, monotonous, and downright drone-like.  There are only three songs on disc three that were really worth it (Slave, My Computer, and the title track).  Well, maybe four, his cover of "La la (means I love you)" is actually really good too.  Those songs could have been put on the first two discs and the 3rd disc really could have been omitted.  The most impressive feat that he manages to accomplish on this entire album is making a great chorus and a great song out of the line "www 'dot' emale `dot' com" on "Emale" :-).  I was unaware of this feat for a while because I used to always skip this song because it started off with that really annoying 90's G-funk whistle.  So overall, this album really does rank amongst Prince's best work, and it should especially appeal to those who would like to see him do more ballads and dive into more R
Rap music today is a tragic lack of creativity. Its not real hip hop. This album, brings back the good feeling that is real hip hop. Honestly, The Light is a song that never gets old, thats real. If you don't have this album, get it.
This CD is a confusing mix of punk bands, from pop-punk's Sum 41  Good Charlotte to punk favorites Alkaline Trio, Vandetta Red,  The Casualties to bands that I've never even heard of such as Unsung Zeros, Ozma,  Destruction Made Simple.  I reccomend this CD if you're looking for new bands to like  listen to.  Although it's a confusing CD, it gives you new ideas of just how deep you're going to go in the punk underground
 I would say that this is the closest that Cheap Trick ever got to making a perfect album. There are only two songs on here that I'm not one hundred percent crazy about...the slow and gloomy depressing title track and ' On the Radio ', which I think kisses up to radio D.J.'s too much. I love the rest of this.This album was my introduction to Cheap Trick and I would definitely recommend it to anybody as introduction to them. ' Surrender ' is an out and out classic and possibly my favorite Cheap Trick song of all time. Like most of the rest of the album, it's heavy, it's catchy, has great singing and interesting lyrics, and it says all it has to say in three to five minutes. ' Auf Weidersehen ' is another favorite tune of mine...it may be one of the heaviest tunes C.T. has ever done. I particularly love Bun E.'s energetic drumming on it. Zander really rips his vocal chords to shreads on this tune! Another great hard rocker is 'Stiff Competition'.Of the more pop oriented songs, I would say ' Taking Me Back ' is another personal favorite of mine. Probably should have been a hit, dang it! ' How Are You ' shows off the band's terrific sense of humor...I particularly like the reference to one of their earlier songs! The other tunes from the first half that I didn't mention are also terrific, particularly ' On Top Of The World '.My only complaint about this newly remastered version is that it doesn't include the lyrics, which WERE included on the original LP version. That is but a minor complaint. I don't think Cheap Trick ever made another album quite as great as this one.
I was waiting for this cd for a very long time, i mean i love all Greg's album, they are intense, passionate, but Amber Headlights is giving me back the soul of the Afghan Whigs, somenthing i missed a lot for a long time . I love his voice, the way he sing, the way he loves his music. You can t explain the beauty of this cd, there are great rock-blues-love songs:the first time i heard "So Thight" it makes me jump up and down my room (i haven t done it for long time since Black Love "Going to town"), then Cigarettes (what a great song, this time i only remember i was singing the chorus with "Gentleman" in my hand), then "Domani" that in italian means tomorrow, kind of Greg's jazz slow song in which his voice is so low that you can t even try to sing like that.Then song after song i realized is the best cd i ever bought after so many years. If you don t know anything about Afghan Whigs and Greg Dulli then it is time to start to listen one of the best alternative artist of our time.
nice CD cool beats songs like Welcome To Atlanta pick it u
For a true Christian Spirit that glows through Ms. Winans, you'll always find her music sung straight from the heart. A Precious Pearl in the Gospel community, "Purified" continues in the CeCe tradition, of lifting our souls to a higher plain
 I picked this up in a bootleg store in Korea a few years back, since it was cheap, and I had loved the movie (perhaps more so than any other of Mallicks's others, even - speaking of which, if you get a chance to see Badlands on the big screen, do yourself a huge favour and do so). As I recall, I didn't really enjoy it on first listen. But then, somehow, I got sucked in. Almost as much as the film itself, this is a hypnotic, haunting slice of poetry. Nothing happens for about a minute, and then it builds and builds. Unforgettable, otherwordly and quite beguiling.  The structure of the soundtrack (especially the songs toward the end featuring Polynesian gospel-style singing) is strongly reminiscent of the Mike Oldfield cd, 'Songs of Distant Earth'. Highly recommended, but do give it a couple of listens, because it might take a while to make its charms felt
I was a music director at a college radio station when this came out, and along with a ton of other albums this one commanded my attention. Shoegazers??? I am sure all the label slinging yahoos are still wiping the egg off their faces. Its as if the band heard they were pigeonholed and gave them all the big finger. Just buy it...and all the rest
WOW!  What a great collection of great classic songs!  We highly recommend this to anyone with any age kids who want to have fun and have fun without the TV!  Hokey Pokey Baby...that's what it's all about
These guys and this album rocks.  Just because the songs force you to move other parts of your body beside your head, doesn't 'demote' it to pop.  Props to the great use of two bass guitars.  Released amid the misery/grunge rock explosion of the early 90's, this was a great escape into rock that just simply made you feel good again. This album is highly recommended.  Kill Your Television, Grey Cell Green, Cut Up, Throwing Things, Happy, and Until You Find Out are just an awesome experience.  If you can find the Grey Cell Green single release, I highly recommend that for the track entitled 'Trust.' 
I just want to put it out there...Audra McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD, listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her thang children. Let her do her thang.
It's been a while since someone has sang the praises of this album.  This is a timeless work.  It never gets old no matter how many times it is played.  I've had this album for 5-6 years and I pull it out every summer.  Great music for boating or BBQ's on the deck.  I promise you will love it.  Something everyone should have in their collection
I've gotten a copy of this cd for every friend I have so they can know what I'm talking about when I crack a random joke.  My mom even loves it and she would not be considered the 'target market'.  For Mitch check out his first cd, if you can find it in stores, if not, go online
There are some amazing moments on this record.  I find myself freaking out to three songs in a row, and waiting for the fourth song to end.  The De La collaboration is weak; it's got the great Wild-Style instrumental but the chorus is obnoxious.  Some of the more R tracks fall flat in my opinion. 
I was a big fan of this band's song "Rock'n'roll highschool", and I recently saw the documentary about them, so, when I saw this anthology selling for around $15 in Australia, I thought I'd take a punt by buying it. My thoughts on this album are similar to the ones I had for the 3 CD Johnny O'Keefe collection [reviewed at this site by me]. Namely, overall, the album is very listenable, with some standout tracks. As with the JOK album, this album is/was great value for money, considering how many songs you get for the price.   Of the songs I PARTICULARLY like on this album, and the ones I have been listening to quite a bit, are:Rock'n'roll High School. This song still rocks after all these years.Do you remember rock'n'roll radio? Good song, though it never got the airplay that the previous song seemed to get here in Australia.Chinese Rock. An Easter Egg song!! Never heard this song before, but it is an instant classic. Very catchy.Danny Says. Another Easter Egg song. Takes some repeated listening to get into, but once you do that, it gets high rotation on your cd player.To me, I can see why The Ramones are considered founders of Punk. At least as far as the music is concerned. However, The Sex Pistols truly DEFINE Punk for me. They have the whole package which I identify with Punk...namely, the punk sound, and the incendiary, anarchistic lyrics.    The Ramones are more middle-class sounding, to my ears at least.    I'm surprised at how poppy/boppy The Ramones are. To me they sound like a Punk Motown band. One of the songs on the 2nd cd, I think, has that classic punk sound, but I didn't make a note of the title. Might have to edit that song in later...could be "Endless Vacation"?   Lastly, the song Danny Says, almost comes across as a Punk Beach Boys song.    Overall, the anthology is often 'samey', but listenable nonetheless, with a handful of songs that I consider 'high rotation' worthy.   Just remembered, "Endless Vacation" seems a terrific song too. Will have to listen to that some more-I've currently got the 1st cd in my cd player. P.S. Listened to this song last night. Really good-the fast talking bit in the song reminds me of the equally good, if not better song by Australian act TISM [or This Is Serious Mum]-"[He'll never be an] ol' man River", about River Phoenix, amongst other people. TISM, like The Ramones, can do bad taste well.
This is one of my favorite releases from Common. This chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers. Songs like I used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop. Not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks. This is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone's collectio
Wow, this album takes me back to the fall of '79, around the same time as MJ was taking over the world with his scorching solo debut "Off The Wall"!! Both of these albums got heavy rotation on my turntable and were house party essentials when I was a 15 yr old kid spinning the hot joints of the day!At this time, Prince was still a virtual unknown to the mainstream, but to a hip urban audience comprised mostly of blacks, gays, and ultra-hip whites who really knew what time it was, this LP served as notice that a "new thang" was brewin' in Minneapolis that was going to take the pop world by storm in a few short years! From the opening track, "I Wanna Be Your Lover", his first big single (gold) to the rockin' "Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?", which also was a single and a true fan fave!--To "Sexy Dancer" which was sure to bring everybody to the dance floor and into a frenzy!Prince then cools down the mood with "When We're Dancing Close and Slow", which is just beautiful with its sparse piano and acoustic 12-string guitar--one of his many underrated slow jams of all time! Then Side 2 opened with the pretty "With You"and into the scorching rockalistic ode to female bisexuality.."Bambi", which still knocks me for a loop! I've had the pleasure of seeing him perform this song live twice down through the years..once in 1980 during his "Dirty Mind Tour" and again in 1992 during his "Nude Tour" while I was overseas!--Awesome!!Then there's what I call "The Great Triplicate"..."Still Waiting" (another underrated slow classic!), followed by what is to me, the definitive version of "I Feel For You"(no disrespect to the great Chaka Khan!), followed by another underrated slow jam masterpiece "It's Gonna Be Lonely", which still sends me today at 41 the same as it did when I first heard it at 15! This album was Prince's first Platinum album, proving that he (at only 22) was indeed a hitmaker and one to watch!This album and the next one, "Dirty Mind", served as a changing of the gaurd from the older established innovators of that day like Stevie Wonder, Earth,Wind  Fire and Parliament / Funkadelic, etc.  is an essential if your collecting Prince classics! In fact, you can't go wrong with this kat between his debut, 1978's "For You" to 1987's "Sign O' The Times"...it just doesn't get any better!
Growing up with Classical Rock and having enjoyed rock music by Rod Stewart, I didn't think I'd like this CD. One evening I was having dinner at a friend's home and they had this one playing. It was beautiful. Being a little older now (in my early 40's), I enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now. This CD of Rod's was nostalgic, romantic and extremely easy to listen to.
These guys are the best group out right now. Every single rapper is AMAZING even Bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics. This album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including Sh*t Can Happen, Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, American Psycho, Fight Music  Revelation. My favorite rappers are Swifty  Eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now (besides Em, only Proof (R.I.P.)  Bizarre do... which are my least favorite rappers in the group) Every song is great even the skits are enjoyable. If you don't have this yet, you are missing out on one of the best cds ever
Joan. You don't love me. Because I'm a guy. But I have loved you since 1976. Ok so I'm an old man (age 43). So what. She's just the best rock and roll female on the planet. I like the young ones like Sahara Hotnights and the Donnas as well but they just don't measure up to Joan Born To Be Bad Jett. This album - like most of her other albums - consists of a mix of old and new songs. Doesn't mattar. I love it. And the video... well it confirms what we have always known. Not that it matters. The music matters
The series of "Golden Age of American Rock  Roll" released byACE couldn't have a better end. During the past 15 years theyhave delighted us with a series of 10 CD's with 30 songs eachremembering the Rock  Roll era mostly with minor top hits between 1954 and 1963. One reason for their tremendous successis the superb quality of all the recordings no matter fromwhat year the original song was. Now besides these series of 10CD's from the R era they have launched another 2 specialeditions with the same title: one with the special noveltyedition and another with the special country edition. Bothdeserve more than 5 stars. The song selection on the novelty edition is just out of sight!Most of the songs brought back memories from a long long timeago since these weren't available after the time they weretop hits. I never found them back on what compilation so everuntil ACE put them all together 45 years later. And with asound quality better than in their original version on 45rpm.Therefore don't hesitate. Buy it together with the countryedition and you will have 60 songs for utmost pleasure; 60songs we grew up with and now with no scratches on them.  
Nothing at all like boy-band CDs (InSync, Backstreet Boys, etc like editorial compared it to).  While some of the songs are over-processed and don't allow Clay's strong, clear, and beautiful voice to shine through enough, it is overall a very good CD. It has some catchy tunes on it.  His second CD, Merry Christmas With Love, allows his wonderful voice to shine through even more
this is the soundtrack that led me into the wonderful world of glam rock!  it is outstanding and i could just play it again and again....  it is certainly one of the most brilliant albums out there and probably my favourite soundtrack of all time.
This album is absolutely beautiful. The full musical sound and talent of Calexico together with the soothing warm vocals of Iron  Wine make the perfect match. It's almost unheard of that I love EVERY song on an album, but this one makes the cut. Each song wraps you in a warm trance, a coccoon of well-being. It has a really positive emotional effect on me. It creates an ambiance of gentle strength.Wonderful. I really hope to see a these two bands getting together for more albums
I was at the Brighton concerts that these recordings were mostly taken from and as a reminder of two stunning nights of music they can't be better. Standout tracks include the two by Martha Wainwright, the two by Teddy Thompson, Perla Batalla's "Bird on a Wire", Rufus' "Chelsea Hotel"  and (from the Sydney concert) Antony's  "If it be your Will". Two major disappointments though; the inclusion of U2 as backing band for Leonard Cohen's own version of "Tower of Song" seems done for purely commercial reasons and doesn't work,  and the nonsensical ommission of Linda Thompson's sublime take on "Alexandra Leaving". Here's hoping it's included on the dvd release
This is not only Brian Eno's best album, but one of the finest albums ever made--a work of simple beauty, complex intelligence, and imagination..
...because it felt like it predicted that I'd be listening to the cd someday.  I'm referring to the line "The kids of AD 2000 will draw from the music much the same sense of well being and warmth that we do today."  Now I admit that I was 18 in 2000 so I guess I technically missed the literal kid description by a year, but the more general prediction of the inter-generational, timeless appeal of the Beatles was right on.  I didn't see them on the Ed Sullivan show.  I was born almost twelve years after they broke up, and about a year after the tragic shooting of John Lennon.  But I, like many, many other people born too late to have experienced Beatlemania as it was occuring, have since become a huge fan of all their work.This album has my favorite of all the Beatle's songs:  I'll Follow The Sun.  That song alone is worth the five stars, but thankfully the rest of the album is great too.  This album gets a little bit too much grief, and it may not be quite as amazing as something like Abbey Road, but it's still better than just about anything else out there. 
Call it American folk, call it alt.country, call it what you like, but if you heard this Aussie trio on CBS or NPR earlier this week, suffice to say their in a category all their own.  Love that harmonica.  Up All Night by the Waifs is appropriately titled.  I'll be up all night listening to it
It's sometimes hard to think there are really anymore pleasing melodies out there, but thank Halstead  co. for proving me wrong. I am happily pleased with their latest, and very eagerly awaited, effort. Instead of the depths of melancholia and loveliness on, say, OUT OF TUNE, they give us 41+ minutes of what seems like basically "it's good, everything's going just way OK..." It's happy. Maybe I'll hear a lyric later that says something else, but for those for whom music is the priority, you can't go wrong with this considered and experienced and artful pop. Four and a half stars
I bought this CD on a whim after I heard Joaquin Phoenix was directing their "Tired of Being Sorry" video.  Whoa!  I was addicted!  I couldn't stop listening to it...I had to get a 2nd copy for the car just so I could stop carrying it back and forth.  GREAT driving music!  The songs are catchy and have a great beat...I haven't heard anything this good in a long while.  I had to have more immediately and luckily found some earlier stuff of Scott Thomas'....more on the acoustic/indie side, but awesome!  I highly recommend Lovers  Thieves (CDbaby.com)  My faves from Ringside are "Struggle", "Trixie", and "Dreamboat 730". You will not be disappointed
you definetely gotta own this. After an 11 years break from the music scene, Seger's back full-force. Already 400.000 copies sold. More info on Bob at [...
Jon Brion does such a great job capturing emotion with great music. hes also so damn great and fitting sound witht the mood of a movie. if you liked this movie, by all means, buy the soundtrack. you will not be dissapointed. Eevery time it listen it not only reminds me of the amazing movie, it makes me feel.. just.. good.Also, be sure to pick up his solo record, Meaningless.IF YOU LIKED THE MOVIE, BUY THIS CD, YOU WONT REGRET IT
Attell is one of the few decent comics out there right now. I wasn't that big of a fan until I saw this in a record store and decided to give it a shot. I'm running out of comedy albums, there's not that many good ones out there. So I bought it and I was impressed. The audience is obviously drunken college kids who were very familiar with the show "Insomniac". They would laugh and scream if just slammed the microphone into his forehead the whole night. He has very good timing and delivery though and his jokes have very unpredictable punchlines for the first time you are hearing them. You never see the punchline coming a mile away. He is vulgar so if you are sensitive in any way to graphic sexual scenarios and profanity, stay away. He is one of the few that I enjoy now, tragically Mitch Hedberg died in March because he was another. The increasingly popular Dane Cook doesn't do it for me. Cook's Retaliation CD has broken all sorts of records for a comedy album. I think Cook is very marketable to the college, 20something crowd, guys like him because he's the loud obnoxious drinking buddy from the frat, chicks think he's cute. I recommomend Attell myself, he is vulgar but is just a better comedian
umm...I don't think you quite got the point of this album. It is not about the artists that you like, it is about the artists that inspired Moore. Your ignorance forces me to do nothing but laugh. I find it funny that you feel you are making a point by saying "F*ck you SOAD" and so on. Have some respect for other's opinions. Unfortunately, you are a steriotypical "ignorant American".So with all that said, and with all due respect, I say, F*ck you pal
I'm a huge Matchbox fan and I listen to a collection of all 3 albums ALL DAY long.  I never get tired of it!  Rob Thomas has such a powerful voice that it just beckons to me.  His lyrics are soul searching and speak directly to me.  What a great band!  What a great album!  What a great musical ride!
This album is incredible.  For me this is one of those few albums that defines a time in my life.  An album that for months I played over and over.  An album that I've played countless times, that I have passed out to when I came home after a late night, that I have ran to, and worked out to, that I play at work for a pick-me up.  It's great.  It's filled with so much emotion and passion, from beginning to end its just brilliant, the entire album.  The songs are composed more like classical music with sweeping scores that start off slow and steady and then build up and explode into these intense jams.  I love it.  You have to buy this album.  Then buy their next self titled album.  Then play it and play it, and play it.  It grows on you.  I can't wait to see them live... 
One of the best Doobie collections out there "Greatest Hits" lives up to its name focusing on the singles the band recorded and that charted in their long career. Some of the songs here are the single versions (meaning they were edited and are shorter than the album versions)and this might be a problem for some fans as they may want the full length versions of songs. Maybe it's because they were trying to squeeze more music onto the CD. Either way fans may want to be aware of that.In fact even on the boxed set we get "Listen to the Music", "Nobody" and "Rockin' Down the Highway" in their single incarnations. Perhaps its because that was the way fans originally heard them on the radio. Either way, fans looking for the full length versions of these songs would do well to pick up one of the import "Greatest Hits" collections or wait for the remastered CDs coming out later this year. This set does have one track not on the boxed set--"Without You" a great rocker. The CD booklet is exactly like the larger booklet that comes with the boxed set just laid out a bit differently.This definitely covers the highlights of the band's career whether it be the Tom Johnston rockin' years, Michael McDonald's blue-eyed soul stage or the band's reunion phase this has a bit of it all.  Personally, I would love to see a two disc distillation of the band's "Greatest Hits" with a second disc of album tracks such as "I Cheat the Hangman", "Losin' End", "The Captain and Me" and "How Do the Fools Survive?". In the meantime this single disc compilation will have to do for most fans. The sound is terrific pulling from the remasters produced by Bill Inglot for the boxed set. Detail and clarity is remarkable and puts the previously issued "Best of" pair to shame. This is the only place to get their singles from their first in 1970 "Nobody" to their last (when this compilation was put togetherin 2001) "Dangerous" released in 1991.  
Okay Bryce nickelback yells not screams BIG difference and wtf sum 41 your kiding right sum 41 does not scream at all and you say "I like music" well you dont know any thing about music and another thing you poser is that Limp bizkit is NOT METAL they rap so how can you say that they scream ALL the time...limp bizkit is the WORST band out their they give a bad name to music itself and as for you dont write anymore reviews until you know more about music wich with the information i just got from you that will take a LONG tim
The Sundays come out with a CD once a decade, thus putting me in constant cravings for new material. Though Camera Obscura is very original and very much their own band, they satisfy the cravings that only Harriet Wheeler could touch. Truly vast and intimate at the same time, and a voice that speaks to something very deep, sad and lovely inside you
I used to listen to a friend's copy of the original "Metal Box" of EP's, when it first came out.Years later the "Second Edition" came out on LP's for those of us who hadn't sprung for the Metal Box before it sold out.Eventually the Second Edition came out on this CD. So I finally could own a digital copy myself. Pristine, audio quality at least as good as the original Metal Box in my opinion, if I remember correctly.You do need to listen to this. You do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too
Michelle Branch carved out a place for herself in the young female pop singer market serveral years ago with a brilliant debut and a successful if derivitive duet with Carlos Santana.  This record is her first with friend Jessica Harp.   The ladies mine the borderline between the singer/songwriter and country genres for quality songs that should fit well in the americana format.Highlights include the opening track Leave the Pieces, Way Back Home, The Good Kind, and the title track Stand Still Look Pretty.  Of special note is the presence of producer/multi-instrumentalist John Leventhal on many tracks.I recommend this record for folks who like songs that don't sound like formula country
What a great album this is, not only is the music a real pleasure to listen to, but the lyrics are a hoot! Wayne is not afraid to experiment, he skillfully combines old school elements with new in such a natural way. The songs pull you right in as if your listening to an old favorite you haven't heard in a long time. This album instantly became one of my favorites. I bought two more to give as gifts.
As with her second album, I love "Thankful". Kelly Clarkson has a beautiful voice and has a lot of talent.I especially like "Whats up lonely", "you thought wrong", and "just missed the train". Although the whole album is very good.
Just wonderful, wonderful!  Even if you haven't seen the movie buy the music...so lovely and refreshing...of course, there is no one like Van Morrison (always and forever a 5-star), he tops the all-time charts for me...Kevin Kline is so smooth with La Mer...and the rest of the music is soulful and enchanting...you just can't miss with this one
The album is straight raw. Kurupt's lyrical abilities are unmatched and go hand in hand with Daz's Delivery. The G-Funk beats are the best they've ever sounded. As a whole, you will not skip one song at all. A+
cool CD...haven't heard it in probably 15 to 20 years...It was fun to hear it again....Funny though, it's a bit different than the way I remember it
I was waiting in anticipation for this cd to arrive and was not disapointed.  Etta is the bes
1978 the stage is set for an album to emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of  Cleveland. Just like their other fellow Ohion's DEVO, the guys in PERE UBU obviously saw the world in a slightly different way.I have owned this recording in various formats since 1980 and I have never grown tired of this album. I find this album to have an almost timless quality in that even though it was recorded over 25 years ago,  if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio and re-record it, it  just would'nt happen. There is just a certain magic that they  captured in 1978, as to the music itself I tend to break - up this  album into 2 distinct parts. Side One being the more accessible "drunken" side with more garage style sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise, but a little too intelligent, just listen to the lyrics.Side 2 is definately the "drug" side like a bad acid trip vocalist David Thomas takes you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of Cleveland(I have never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric) and the rest of the band help to re-inforce this craziness by going off in a million different directions.I could give you a track by track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is somethig you should anylize, experience and consume at your own leisure, and then form your own opion of what each of the songs on this album  mean to you. So if you loved things like Throbbing Gristle's song Hamburger Lady then u will surely love Pere Ubu's album the Mordern Dance.As another reviewer mentioned before Black Francis of The Pixies fame must have almost certainly listened to these guys.I also hear there influences in recent  bands such as Portishead and Queens of the Stone Age just to name a few.So if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as fresh sounding as it was in 1978 then give your ears a chance to have a listen to this album, even if you have to beg,steal or borrow it.
this is my favorite ghostface slbum. it has a geat vibe to the cd and you could not get sick of hearing it. check it out and you wont be dissapointed.rating A
I feel bad doing this becuase I love Iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad. All the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating. It's like the first Beatles Anthology set: the material is amazing but the quality is bad. On the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise. The packaging is also very nice. I just though I'd share this information before you drop all the money on the set. If you are a Stooges fan don't hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait.
The Four Seasons have always been one of my favorite groups. I think Frankie Valli has one of the best voices in the world and without the doubt the greatest falsetto in existence, and the rest of the group had harmonies that only The Beach Boys could match. nd for band that has had as any hits as them are destined to have a barrage of greatst hits collection. Up until now, I always felt the best way to obtain all the Four Seasons' best songs was by getting Rhino's single disc "The Very Best Of The Four Seasons". Well, I was wrong. "In Season: The Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons Anthology" is the definitve Four Seasons collection.On these two discs, you find all the essential Four Seasons songs, including "Sherry", "Big Girls Don't Cry", "Walk Like A Man", "Dawn (Go Away)", "Rag Doll", "Let's Hang On (To What We've Got)", "Working My Way Back To You", "Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me)", "Tell It To The Rain" (an often forgotten Top 10 hit and my favorite Four Seasons song ever), "Who Loves You" and "December 1963 (Oh, What A Night)". But the majority of the cd is a wealth of rarities, including many songs that were either album tracks, uncharted singles or Frankie Vali solo singles. Plus, you get it for about $25.00, which I consider fairly cheap for a cd with 51 songs. The 30+ page booklet is excellent, filled with track information (chart positions, etc.), rare photos and an excellent essay written by Pat Sierchio. This is an absolute must have
I got what I wanted in the time frame promised...the way it's supposed to work
Dave Alvin's sublime new CD is a cadre of songs written by Californians either born and/or who grew up in this land. The lyrics talk about what it means to live and love in the land of dreams and broken promises. It is also a look at the story of the frontier in this large western state. Dave Alvin has a voice that is deep and smooth and like a friend of his said "infiltrates your brain like a shot of Jack Daniels." Dave Alvin says "We started with a list of 25 songs, from Steve Gillette to Captain Beefheart and everything in between. I was even thinking of doing 'Going Back to Cali' as a blues thing. In the end, though, it wasn't about choosing my favorite songs so much as choosing songs that I could sing well enough and arrange differently enough to make them interesting." He has picked these songs carefully and each of them fit his style and voice well. Of them all, and I like each and every one, my two favorite interpretations are "Here In California" and "Surfer Girl""California Bloodlines" is a sentimental rendition of John Stewart's fine work, which finds peace in knowing "There's California bloodlines in my heart / There's a California woman in my song ... And a California heartbeat in my soul.""Redneck Friend" the Jackson Brown less well known song was just right for Dave Alvin's style."Kern River" is a song Merle Haggard wrote after losing his best friend, and it is a melancholy rendition."Blind Love" from Tom Waits is sung in a bluesy style with some doo wops thrown in to give it style."Here in California" one of my favorites is sung  with Christy McWilson. He felt this song needed a woman's perspective."I'm Bewildered" is an old Richard Berry, the great guitarist's tune. Backed up by The Calvenes."Sonora's Death Row" written by Blackie Ferrell is a fable that examines the price of acting out of greed and anger and ends up a as gun fighter's tale."Down On the Riverbed" is an old Los Lobos song that is sung in Dave Alvin's old blues style."Between the Cracks" a song written by Dave Alvin and Tom Russell is a heartbreaking tale of young boy told by a loving woman, with a rollicking tune. This is the only Dave Alvin orignal song in this CD."Don't Look Now" a song sung by John Fogerty is an old Creedence Clearwater revival. Bluesy and fun to make it Dave's."Tramps and Hawkers" by Jim Ringer is a delicate country waltz, come dance with me, BK.  Lyrics are wonderful."Loser" by Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter, is darker with more infused blues than Garcia's version. It couldn't sound less like a Deadhead song. Dave Alvin put in a psychedelic section  that is a tribute to the San Francisco sound"Surfer Girl" Brian Wilson's first song is done with doo-wops and again The Calvanes did background. This is my favorite of  Dave Alvin's interpretations, and he sings this surfin'song with some tongue in cheek. Dave Alvin gives voices of California to this CD. Voices from the California coastline and the surf music it inspired to the "brown earth of the state" to the frontier life and the lives won and lost. Dave Alvin had made his mark on this state, and the writers who loved their lives by writing and singing about the state they love. Play it often and pay attention to the subtle influence of this CD. "California Dreamin'?" Highly recommended. prisrob 6-04-06  
Before I review this classic Rolling Stones album, I just want to point out that Juke Box Hero and whirligig are one in the same person. A troll who likes to trash great music and praise Dire Straits(who are a good band but nit the greatest) and Green Day. I say CUT THE SHENANIGANS!Now that is off my chest, back to the review!The Rolling Stones' second album to be released on their own label fittingly called Rolling Stones Records, which was distributed by Atlantic at the time(now Virgin/Capitol), entitled Exile on Main Street was released in May of 1972. The album was the band's only double studio album but is one of rock's greatest double studio albums in history and ranks up there with other classic 2-record sets like The Wall, Quadrophenia, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and Tommy among others. Before guitarist Keith Richards' heroin addiction took over for some time in the mid-1970s, he was what the late producer Jimmy Miller called a workhorse. The album was recorded at Keith's home in France and at Olympic Studios in London and Muscle Shoals in Alabama and in Los Angeles. Keith's music and frontman Mick Jagger's lyric writing was arguably at its peak on Exile on Main Street. Songs like the opening rocker Rocks Off, the 50s sounding rocker Rip This Joint, the album's hit Tumbling Dice, the country-ish Sweet Virginia, Keith's classic rocker Happy(and it is his most famous track which he sang), the slow-ish Soul Survivor, the fast-paced blues rocker All Down the Line and the soul sounding Shine a Light are classics which sound like they could have been recorded yesterday. Ventilator Blues was another highlight as it was the only song that Mick and Keith wrote was co-written by guitarist Mick Taylor whom just tore the place up from 1969-74(his solos just rocked from 1969-74). Exile on Main Street was The Rolling Stones' second consecutive #1 album and another million seller. The tour in support of the album saw the band getting bigger and bigger. Almost 35 years on, this album is still a classic!This album is hugely recommended
I had originally heard "Drive Away" on a radio station and I was instantly blown away.  Upon seeing the music video for it, I decided to buy the CD.  I was hardly disappointed.  The emotion that goes into the CD is amazing and it's definitly a CD to sit down and enjoy.  I saw the band in concert and met Jonah after the show and was amazed by how down to earth he was. Give Gratitude a chance and you won't be disappointed.
A very proud and highly recommended production, it's a real pitty this cd is not available, i still have this one as a precious thing, i hear it all the time as well as i want. Nobody will forget Jeff Lynne as an excellent musician, ever
It tiptoes through the years and delivers the punch, but as I wrote in my review, I never thought Shangri La was going to be the last, though it appears just that. But All in the Suit, man, they did that after Shangri la de and I wonder, if this was the direction to come, my god!!!!It's worth it for that track alone..5 stars is my own way of saying thank you, but it is not just sentimental, the only album in the short career that wasn't great was Tiny Music, but the quote "Trippin" made up for it.It's a shame it's over. I don't like revolver, it's not evolution for Weiland and I can't imagine him being happy there, it steps back and all I ever hoped was that someday this band, STP, would reign supreme and been given the praise and adulation they deserve. ALl i can do is give stars, but I would rather buy another STP album or go see them live...is rock dead? I think it is and it went with this band
Well, here we are.  One of the true works of the electronic genre in the 90's, "Lifeforms" is true sonic adventure.  This is obviously some of the best work that FSOL ever did.  "Lifeforms" is a double album of electronic and ambient moments spliced together, interchanged and meshed.  For ambient work, it has a lot of randomness and bright detail thrown in at a rapid pace.  There is a lot of energy and terse grab to the songs, despite their being ambient.  It is very original, I praise originality in music.  Give it a try, put on some "Flower" "Bird Wings" or some "Elaborate Burn.
I'm really not sure what the purpose of this Disc is, other than as an Adam Ant filler for those collectors who need to add more to their collection.  This is a slightly scaled down version of the truly best of "Antics in the Forbidden Zone" which detailed Adam Ant's career up until the bombastic "Apollo 9" album.  "Essential" adds the 1990 single "Room at the Top" from "Manners  Physique" album and "Wonderful" from the 1995 "Wonderful" album.  These two songs are not really worth the cost of admission and I think are probably the weakest songs on those two albums, anyway.  And of course "Essential" ignores the unreleased 1993 album "Persuasion" which had some really good songs on it.  If you want later period Adam Ant, "Manners" is really good and "Wonderful" is, well, less than wonderful, but still a worthwhile Adam Ant.  If you want an introduction to Adam Ant, the chronologically catalogued "Antics" is great and a more complete collection! 
I love jazzy hip-hop of the early '90s and if you do too,this is the album you must listen to! all the songs are wonderful but there are some of these which are something of supernatural like the famous (and the most beautiful of the entire cd!) "Award Tour", "Steve Birko(stir it up)" and "Midnight".enjoy this pearl of REAL hip-hop!!!
...wandering through the dorms in the 1970's this was one of those albums that was in everyone's collection. It was usually very near the front of the record stack. Every time I hear that opening guitar riff from Reelin' in the Years I glide back to a very nice place in time. If you hope to understand the evolution of US pop/rock music you need to become intimate with this recording!
This is some great music from a litte know movie. You won't be let down
The more I listen to this album, the more I love it. What's sounds somewhat familiar even formulaic at first becomes totally captivating on further listening.  Like a girl you thought was nothing special at first glance but then becomes beautiful as you get to know the complete package. This is one cooooool CD. 
I love these albums.  Get all 3 cause they are great
ahh this is a great cd. i listen to it every day. it's fun music, and the lyrics are wonderful. hope everybody enjoys it as much as i do
Collin has done it again.  I didn't think I'd enjoy a CD as much as his The Walls Came Down, but Tracks is just great.  Every song is better than the last.  You can't go wrong with Collin Raye  and you can't find anyone with a better voice.  Buy this one
The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally "learnt the language," and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new.Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films.You cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel
Like many of the highly talented and innovative groups of the 1980's, The Pet Shop Boys were ahead of their time.  This album was purchased mainly for "West End Girls" and "It's a Sin."  Play this album from beginning to end without interruption - it's fantastic.  "Loves Comes Quickly" emerges for me as the best of The Pet Shop Boys remarkable and unique sound - a composition reflecting orchestral complexity and pulsating energy.  The great contributions of Great Britain and Australia to music in the 1980's in my opinion comes largely from their composers and performers effectively combining the power and harmonic complexity of some classical music compositions of the mid 1920's to the early 1950's (no doubt the origins of some great movie scores) with the emerging sophistication and always present upbeat effect of rock and roll.  You will love The Pet Shop Boys
i recently saw them in san francisco just like one of the other reviewers, and i thought it was astonishing. i know a lot of people got mad cause they didnt move around or anything, i mean it couldn't be because they were trying to concentrate or anything like that! the great thing about this album is that all the instruments standout at the same time. farina(the lead singer)has calmed down after the last couple of albums and often times speaks his lyrics in a soft and heartfelt way that make you wish you could get into a conversation with him right then and there.and his guitar playing has even matures after the bed is in the ocean. the drummer just flat out rocks. his punctuality is a lot of the reason why these guys are so tight. the bass speaks just as well as the guitar does and sometimes takes over as the guitar holds it together and the bassist go off on his own little excursion. well, if you have a problem with a band not rocking out, i dont know what to tell you. it is jazzy, but let me be the one to tell you this is the best jazz i've heard. i think this is the only path they could of taken. you got to evolve. sometimes that cant always be a good thing but in this case ,karate is the exception. love this
OMG!! This is Relient Ks best CD yet. You should buy it, even if you didn't care for their other CDs. Because....well...it ROCKS!!
Brian Regan is simply a comedic genius.  This cd is especially funny after having seen him live--you can just picture his hilarious gestures and facial expressions!  He has managed to create a hysterical routine based on the silly stuff we've all said/done/thought.  While I too enjoy comedians who are more "cutting edge", I don't think a routine has to be peppered with profanity to be funny.  This cd is well worth any price; check out his DVD and his live show, too
You can resume EDDIE COCHRAN very well with one cd.After all,when he died he was only 21 years old.This selection is almost the same if you except 5 songs of the LEGENDARY MASTER SERIES released in 1990.His best songs are there:SUMMERTIME BLUES was of course a favorite of THE WHO ,who often featured it in their concerts.I am particularly fond of JEANNIE,JEANNIE,JEANNIE,C'MON EVERYBODY and the marvellous SOMETHIN'ELSE with it's great shuffle,a trademark of EDDIE.If you are interested in rock's early days,you'll enjoy this cd
If you were lucky enough to buy the soundtrack when first released in 1987 on Enigma Records, hang on to that out of print gem!  Straight To Hell is back on CD as Straight to Hell Returns, and may have a lot more tracks this time, but it also deleted two tracks from the original release and shortens another track.Not appearing this time are: "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" by The Pogues, and my personal favorite "Money, Guns And Coffee" by Pray For Rain.  The track "The Killers" by Pray For Rain ran 2 minutes 55 seconds on the original, but on this new release was shortened to only 2 minutes.  This is rather perplexing considering Straight To Hell Returns runs a total of 55 minutes 7 seconds, which would have left room for those other tracks to be included (since CDs can run a total of 79 minutes 59 seconds).  I'm deducting a point from my rating of this CD because the missing tracks should have been included!On the plus side, this new release contains a lot of short instrumental tracks from the film that were not on the original CD release in 1987, as well as some brief dialogue excerpts.  The film was a misunderstood classic, and the soundtrack of spaghetti western-style rock is wonderful: The Pogues, Joe Strummer, Pray For Rain, Zander Schloss, Elvis Costello's MacManus Gang, and even dialogue excerpts from Courtney Love before she was, well, I guess the word is "famous."  If you're a fan of any of these artists, you'll love this assortment of songs...those not familiar with the film may not be able to absorb the atmosphere these songs and instrumentals create, so get the film on DVD and you'll appreciate the works of these artists so much more.The liner notes claim this CD is to be considered the "official" soundtrack, while the first release of it back in 1987 was basically a "souvenir."  I enjoy both releases immensely, but since I was listening to those other deleted tracks for nearly 20 years now, it's sad to not hear them this time around
This is Jewel's first CD and I enjoyed it especially Foolish Games and You Were Meant For Me. I can't wait for her latest
linkin park are still together and they are making their next album, it is due out eairly next year. mike just did this for fun.look into things a little more buddy before you start saying things.Oh yeah, and if you like good hip-hop, you'll like this album. give it a shot. you dont have to be a linkin park fan to enjoy this record, since its nothing like LP.peace
I'm just starting to become a true fan of Pigpen.  Earlier, I just didn't get him and I would constantly skip forward to more of the GD extended jams.  Lately, I've started to get what he was all about and what made him such an important part of the early dead shows.  I'm glad I picked up this set.  It's Pigpen's night and we should all be happy for this nice memory.  Pick it up.Note: the rest of the band has some fine moments too!!
At the end of the day, when you come home from school or work, one can't say I feel great. Rather than great, we are stressed and tired. The sounds of falling rain is evermore relaxing that this CD captures it it almost perfectly. I too, am always stressed at the end of a work day and have relaxed to the sound of falling rain; and it does work. It would also be helpful to listen to while sleeping. With quiet, natural sounds, it will have a soporific effect on its listeners and relax you
If this is to truly be GYBE's last piece of work, then they've concluded their brief and dynamic catalog on a fitting note.While I still believe "Lift Yr. Skinny Fists..." is their masterwork, "Yanqui" is easily a close second.  Where "Fists" had a broader range of sounds and textures - elements of sacred and profane - "Yanqui" is more balanced and focused.  Although you could argue this point, I think "Yanqui" never gets as high or low as "Fists."The sound on "Yanqui" is entirely consistent with their previous releases.  As other reviewers mentioned, the only major change is the absence of field recordings, which actually helps to distinguish this album as the finale.  The lack of human voice adds a new aura of mystery to the work.Well, there is actually another surprising moment on this album: it happens during a movement about halfway into the album.  The guitars drop off, leaving only a small ensemble playing dissonant woodwinds over a steady tribal percussion.  For a few minutes it definitely doesn't sound like typical GYBE.  In fact, the dissonant horns sound almost like a Ligeti composition (although Ligeti probably wouldn't have used a steady rhythm of any kind).  Fear not.  Not only does it work, but it swells nicely into a full band tidal wave.But here's the most important point I want to make about Yanqui:  To me, it resolves some of the musical themes "Fists" introduced, which makes U.X.O. a fitting conclusion.  The last bit on "MFer=Redeemer P.1" slows way down, featuring one guitar with one violin (i think) playing together in fragile harmony, along with some distortion in the background.  When I listen to this, I can't help but think of the very beginning of "Fists," except the melody changes just enough to resolve the paranoia that  the "Fists" melody introduced.  In other words, it's like I can hear GYBE - at last - acknowledging that there does exist some...hope!...some goodness!....some peace!...in this world - the very place that's inspired them to make such dissonant music.  And, well, if GYBE can slow down and acknowledge something hopeful exists, well then, hope must exist.  Indeed, mother****er does = redeemer.Of course, they give us one last act on "Yanqui" just to kick our butts one final time.  Yes, it gets so out of control that, at one point, the siren that's blaring in the background seems appropriate.The very end, I love, as it builds and builds and builds with distortion and droning until the music finally--it suddenly ends."Yanqui U.X.O." is possibly the final act in a brief but brilliant catalog.  It's an awesome finale
I have been a Barry Manilow fan since I was a teenager.  I have NEVER been disappointed with any of his work and this CD is no exception!  He is such a brilliant arranger and the remix of these classics is fabulous!  His voice is as good as ever!  Even my 7 year old begs to listen to the CD everytime we get in the car and she can sing all the words! 
I read some of the other reviews before I submitted this.  I don't see how someone could get upset over the liner notes.  Redd doesn't include Danny Gatton as an influence because he didn't listen to him.  As far as other reviews concerning tone and the lack of fire, well, I don't even know how to address that.  Redd has one of the best tones I've heard on the tele and his note selection is what sets him apart from other pickers.  Ever hear of diarrhea of the guitar?  Well, you won't get that on this CD because Redd doesn't play something to just play it.  This CD showcases Redd's versatility from country, to swing, to blues, to rock, it has it all.  If you like good pickin', then by this CD
I was already a fan of Mike and the Jacksons, But when Motown 25 came on in 83, this guy set the standard for what music and performance could be and where it could go. Till this day in my lifetime that one performance at Motown 25 is the single most perfect performance I've ever seen. I remember the next day at school and the next month after that performance we had all kind of talent shows where all of the kids were trying to out moonwalk each other. The saddest and funniest part was watching the less fortunate kids who could not afford the Michael gear wearing tube socks with dress shoes and kids making home made glitter and rhinestone gloves. Hilarious. As an adult, I refuse to let the media and even Michael himself ruin my childhood memories of this untouchable piece of music.24 years later Thriller remains the album to beat
Review no.77.A superbly/nicely done reissue of The Zombie's second 'actual' album(isn't it?).Total of 27 tracks,so since the first twelve(12)cuts were the original lp,I guess that means you get seventeen bonus tracks,wow!That's a lot,for a one-disc release.A fine CD to repeatedly play,plus keep in your 'current rotation' stack for a long time to come.It's PROBABLY just me,but these tunes SHOULD be in a different playing order.That's why I'll sometimes pre-program this CD before I listen to it.Loads of fabulous/memorable tunes to enlighten your evening with here,like "Care Of Cell 44"(three versions,but welcome),"Time Of The Season"(stereo and mono versions),the beautifully-done melodic "A Rose For Emily"(2 versions),"I Want Her,She Wants Me","Maybe After He's Gone" and a cut that I've certainly never heard before,but was quite impressed with it,"Butchers Tale".Obviously,The Zombies must've had hours of unreleased material that most of the world didn't take great notice of,until now.Simply,a must-have.Timeless top rate British Invasion rock that'll never truly die
Right, so by putting a review down for this album, I am getting labeled as an emo kid who wears his sweater too tight, cuts himself and cries over his girlfriend all day long, well too bad that's not me, I am just a normal person who can tell the diference between bad and good music. Hawthorne Heights is an emo band who are criticised by lots and loved by lots of others, I have to agree that their lyrics are quite simplistic and are used over and over, they might even sound gay at some points, although, "we are so last year" made me laugh "I should have known you better, i should blame it on the weather" wtf is that??? Anywyas so the lyrics are probably the reason why I'm giving this 4 and not 5. But here we're talking music not lyrics. The music has nothing very special to it and I can play every song on guitar, they often use the same chords except for a few songs "This Is Who We Are", but they have a lot of interesting melodies and don't just rely on power chords to make their music interesting. Even though these chord sequences are often re-used, Hawthorne Heights always manage to make their sound diverse and interesting and they are slowly imposing themsleves as the kings of knock-out choruses. The other thing I have noticed in this album is that there are much less screaming parts which is an improvement and the guitarist has finally learnt where his place is in the band (behind his guitar) but also when is a good time to scream and when it isn't. This makes them quite different from most other emo bands who literaly destroy their sound with high shrieks. Hawthorne have become a little darker and even tune down their guitars in some of their songs now adding a bit more heavyness. Also check out "Where can I stab myslef in the ears" to see how hawthorne have improved. Overall this is a step forward from their last album, it won't change the emo scene forever, but it will leave its mark in your memories and will give you a good moment when listening to it
I am a lover of "greatest hits" compact discs but this one by far is the best one I have purchased recently.  This compact disc has almost all of the best tunes that Joe Walsh made and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to rock!
With his snarling, gritty guitar tones, swampy grooves, and scratchy vocals, C.C. Adcock makes butt-shakin' music that blends rockabilly, old-school Memphis R, New Orleans funk, Cajun dancehall tunes, and juke-joint blues. He's young, but no poseur: Having paid dues with Bo Diddley and Buckwheat Zydeco, Adcock knows rootsy textures like the back of his hand. But despite the tremolo guitar and slapped upright bass, this isn't a retro-sounding record. Adcock and his various producers bring a hip sonic edge to the music that keeps the moods fresh and the vibe ominous. Doyle Bramhall joins Adcock on two songs, and together they raise 6-string hell. Boasting richly layered guitars and heaps of attitude, Adcock's music is soulful, somewhat twisted, and deeply satisfying
Too bad this group supported by Keith Sweat didn't go any further.  I bought it for one song, but the whole CD is great for listening.  Lyrics contain songs about love and such, and I like they way speak about it.  It gives you something to look forward to. 
I am just writing this review to correct Alexander from Russia, who cites this album as a Christianity peddler.  Leonard Cohen is a Jew, who unlike Bob Dylan (on John Wesley Harding) embraces his sense of Jewish heritage and religion within his music.  Alexander, you've brought your own interpretation to what is a distinctly Jewish artist and his work
Hounds is an outstanding piece of work. Two outstanding pieces of work if you look at it properly. The first consisting of five individual songs, though all with a very similar feel and texture. The second is a conceptual set of songs called The Ninth Wave, which has had many meanings read into it.All five tracks from the first piece are excellent. The opening track, Running Up That Hill, is possibly Kate's greatest single of all time (up there with Wuthering Heights and Babooshka), it is a powerful song with simple but highly emotional lyrics. It has been reworked by Aussie outfit Infusion in recent years and become a big dance floor anthem for the likes of John Digweed and DJ Tiesto. It had lost none of it's appeal or sense of urgency over time.The title track is a beautiful, upbeat song. Again it has made a resurgence in the last year, thanks to mod-rock UK band The Futureheads.The Big Sky is my favourite (You want my reply? What was the question? I was looking at the big sky!). The extended mix is great and available on the 1997 EMI remastered release of Hounds.Mother Stands For Comfort is a little out of place, dark and eerie it would have felt right at home on The Dreaming. Kates vocals are, in my opinion, sublime on this track.The fantastic song, Cloudbusting, nearly deserves a review on it's own. A masterpiece in modern pop, it tells one of the best stories I've ever heard in a pop song, and combines it with one of the best video clips I've ever seen.The Ninth Wave is beyond review. You need to buy this LP and listen to it over and over again. It will mean different things to different people, and I think that is what makes it so amazing. Commonly interpretted as the story of a woman drowning, I have weaved several meanings through the story at various times of my life, but each ends happily - the whimsical The Morning Fog makes sure of it... Else, just put it on and lose yourself in the soundscape, read nothing into it and take the Ninth Wave for a musical ride. That's my favourite way to listen to it.Finally, if you ever need to test the ability of a piece of sound equipment, say the $2000 amplifier you're about to splurge on, take the remastered LP as your test. The percussion should be clear, the vocals crisp and the stereo separation precise. An outstanding LP in every way!
Need to say more? This is one of the most beautiful and honest records western popular music ever seen. She sings beauty, so lovely, as some fairy enchanting gnomes in a huge yet peaceful forest, away from the horrors of humanity. That alien feeling you'll get it since its first five seconds and it will lasts till the end. Druids of the world unite
what a beautiful album! one of the rare albums that  has no fillers or weaker cuts. i'd call it a classic but that makes it sound dusty. these songs could come out in 20 years and still sound fresh. 
REM has had a helluva lot of hits, and has remained a radio staple and has been a big influence on later bands.  This 18-track album does a good job for its length, but I really do feel a 2-CD hit package is warranted.  The biggest omissions are "Shiny Happy People," "It's the End of the World as We Know It," and "This One Goes Out to the One I Love."  It wouldn't surprise me if the band didn't really like these songs and would rather not include them in their greatest hits collection.  However, there are a few other more minor hits I know from them that are missing, like "Radio Free Europe."  I just can't think of other titles right now, but there are more than a few other omissions too.Many of the minor hits that are included here, thankfully, are very good and will grow well on you: "The Great Beyond," "Bad Day," "All the Way to Reno," "E-bow the Letter," and "Imitation of Life" are songs I haven't heard enough of and I'm glad they are on this collection.  Still, I hear REM is coming out with another compilation and I imagine it will be more complete; I suggest waiting for that album when it comes out
I had been hearing "Always Thinking Of YOU."   But, I never got who it was.   I purchased XM radio and on the smooth jazz channel, I heard the cut again and got the artist name.  Purchased the CD based on that one cut.   Every cut is great on this cd.   I look forward to catching him live at some point and will continue to look for more from him in the future.   He has his own style.  But, not only do you hear hints of Benson and Brown..........I hear a little Doc Powell as well.   I will be introducing friends to this great artist............Keep it coming............
Following the demise of Soundgarden in 1997, everyone was curious what Chris Cornell would do next. Would he immerse himself in another band where he could display his blood-curdling screams or would he surprise everyone with something totally different? He chose the latter. With Natasha Shneider on keys and Alain Johannes on guitars, Cornell found the opportunity to break away from his heavily Zeppelin and Sabbath-rooted musical background, and he also asked some other musicians to make an appearance on the record. The result is a very diverse album, highlighting Cornell's immediately identifiable vocals and relatively more simpler songwriting. That said, he had the chance to incorporate a multitude of other instruments, including tambourine, theremin, and timpani. Besides the trademark blues rock-ridden songs that helped Cornell make a name for himself, he also digs deep into psychedelia, best heard on "Preaching the End of the World", a song that finds Cornell opting for thick, Radiohead-like arrangements, lofty acoustics, and a strange mix of keyboard and guitar effects. Not too different is "Disappearing One", guesting Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron with its moving vocal melodies, shimmering keyboards and even a vague clarinet addition. Surely, Soundgarden fans expecting a very heavy record with meaty guitars and lots of aggressive vocals will be sorely disappointed. But they need to realize Euphoria Morning was meant to be different way before Cornell started working on it. Solo projects serve the purpose of letting the artists express themselves in ways they are unable to in their own bands. And considering this, Euphoria Morning is a huge success. That said, there are still some songs where the band behind Cornell churns out some rocking riffs and rhythms, such as "Flutter Girl" and especially "Pillow of Your Bones" during the chorus. The former starts out in an almost poppy fashion but quickly picks up a playful funk bass line and is finished off with a cool blues lead; whereas the latter is more straightforward, employing lots of acoustic and electric guitars as well as weird percussion work. The final song "Steel Rain" is also a number that alternates between decidedly heavier parts and more haunting, ominous moments. The ethnic drumming (great tabla rhythms) on this track is quite experimental given Cornell's music with Soundgarden and later on with Audioslave."Follow My Way" and "When I'm Down" are the most moving songs, with the latter featuring a deft piano and organ melody beneath Cornell's heartfelt delivery. This is another song that embraces his love for bluesy guitar work and it also features some female backing harmonies during its pre-chorus. Similarly, the title track is a passionate piece where Cornell sings entirely a capella over acoustic guitars. There are no other instruments; Cornell plays his guitar and simply sings his heart out. A remix of the effect-laden "Mission" would later be included on the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack while "Moonchild" became a minor hit with its eerie atmosphere along with the opening song "Can't Change Me", perhaps the most modern-sounding, upbeat song on the album. Despite being only three minutes though, its flow is majestic, borrowing harmonica, tambourine and shimmering keyboards that climax at the final second. My European copy of the album contains a very different version of the opening song, with French lyrics, accordion, mandolin, and female vocals backing Cornell. The song returns to its English chorus at one point, but the rest is all delivered in French and perhaps more engaging than the original version in some ways. Chris Cornell is one of the greatest voices in rock and this solo album is testimony to his greatness. When freed from any band restrictions, the man is capable of crafting some of the most moving and brutally honest songs ever.
I heard the first Beat LP (I Just Can't Stop It) in a small town record shop in 1980 and instantly fell in love with this band's brand of ska/soul/rock.  For some strange reason, I never bought Wha'ppen and never got familiar with it.  I confess to reading some less than enthusiastic reviews and shying away.  Of course, I did buy Special Beat Service and found it to be par excellent.  So I ordered Wha'ppen a couple of months ago and it arrived a few weeks back and I've been wearing it out.  Damn!  How did I miss this?  This is a great collection of snaky sweet, politically smart songs.  Doors of Your Heart... I've loved that song for years... and Too Nice to Talk To has always been a favorite.  But every other single song on this CD, including the bonus tracks, is outstanding.  These songs are textural wonders.  Great stinging guitar work and the incredible Saxa on his horn make this a stunning recording.  I regret not discovering it sooner, but it sure is a nice find after-the-fact.  Oh yeah... one more thing... I had the pleasure of meeting Dave Wakeling in Nashville this past summer and he's a very nice fellow who cares about the people that support him.  If he comes to a venue near you, don't miss the show.  You'll get your money's worth and more.  Wear your dancin' shoes.  He is truly one of the great talents of the 80's and continues to make significant music.  He may be the most underrated recording artist of the past two decades.  Buy this CD.  You won't regret it. It sounds best in the early evening.  I'm the Big Oh and I gotta go
I have seen Al Jarreau 20 times in concert (and recently saw Al and George perform at the Hollywood Bowl) and am a long-time fan from WAY BACK. There are a few Al CDs that you just play forwards and backwards (and back when they were cassettes, you wore out the tape) because they're just PERFECT. "Breakin' Away", "Jarreau" and "Heaven and Earth" come to mind. Well, add "Givin' It Up" to that list. If you're an old-school Al fan and you're wondering whether to buy this CD, BUY IT. It will live up to all of your Al expectations. There's a "Look the Rainbow" feel to it, there's a "Breakin' Away" feel to it, there's a "Jarreau" feel to it. There's even a "Glow" feel to it (when you think about tunes like "Milwaukee" and "Have You Seen the Child?"). Grassroots Al.It's got the production values of "Heaven and Earth" and "Tenderness". FABULOUS production, arrangements, gathering of talent. There is not one song on here that you will skip as you're listening to it driving to work or whatever. In fact, if you're throwing a party and want to instantly get people in a jazzy party mood, put on this CD because between everybody from Chris Botti to Jill Scott to a SOULFUL Paul McCartney, people will stop and say, "Wow, listen to Jill and George tearing up 'God Bless the Child.'" And "Is that Paul McCartney tearing up 'Bring It on Home to Me'?" [Yes, it is.] Meanwhile, Al and George are working their magic the entire time, and guests will say, "Listen to George right there." And, "Al is jamming right now." It's a conversation-stopper provided by the best thing that can stop a conversation at a party: fabulous music that people must comment on. Of course, that's where the conversation picks right back up, so you win either way. The blend is perfect: Just a touch of scatting, just a touch of voice-beat, with lots of fabulous jazzy vocals by both Al and George, tons of great music solos, and George playing a perfect guitar.If you're a George Benson fan, you will be THRILLED with this CD because George provides a fabulous through-line to every piece. He's ever-present with every wonderful thing he ever did on a guitar. He fronts many of the pieces, and he's not in any way relegated to "background guitarist." He IS the music in every piece, with few exceptions. As much as I love Al, this CD is MAGICAL because of the blend of George and Al. ONLY THESE TWO CAN PAIR UP TO MAKE THIS KIND OF CD. There IS NO OTHER TEAM who could have pulled this off. You need Al's voice and George's guitar. Period. In fact, I'm guessing much of the jazz music world is a tad jealous right now of how simply GENIUS this CD is, as in, "Dang. These two are GREAT together. Wow."Bottom line: This is a perfect blend of these two greats' talents. George takes care of the music, while Al provides the wide gamut of vocals he's an expert at (and that only he can provide). If you've been a long-time fan of either of these two, you won't be disappointed. It's not lopsided. And it's OLD-SCHOOL in every good way. My prediction: This CD will sweep the Grammys. If it doesn't, there is no justice. Like another reviewer on this page, I intend to buy this CD for about EIGHT people. It's just THAT perfect
Hey Bret is one of the most tallented song writers of our time!  He will be in the rock n' roll hall of fame when he is done and his guitar playin' and singin' is very underrated!  Buy this
I love this show so much!! IT just has so much passion and beauty and all the cast members sing so well!! Sutton Foster as Jo, was cast very well, its obvious she deserved that Tony nomination in 2005, and the sisters, even though they weren't the leads, they all had such great songs, especially Beth, whose song, "Some things are meant to be" always brings tears to my eyes,its just so touching. I would definitely recomend this CD to anyone who loves musical theatr
I saw these guys live in the Twin Cities last week. They opened for Keane and The Zutons. These guys were definitely the best part of the show. They had great energy and actually looked like they were having fun. To top it off, they sounded great and their songs were well written. Give these guys a shot, unless you hate Rock 'n' Roll!!
This CD is SOO cool!! I love all the songs! They are all good efforts. I especially like Mr. Coffee You Have gotta hear that song! Other than that this is a great CD!! buy it today!! You'll Enjoy i
Unlike other classical-crossover artists minus Emma Shapplin, I believe Sarah Brightman works for art, not for money, or fame, or show off. Like what she said in an interview, she sees music a a whole--music is to be enjoyed (and categorization should never get in the way). That's apparent from this very endearing album La Luna.I think this album is as a whole better than any song in it although my favourites are still the mystical Figlio Perduto, the dreamy Serenade/How Fair this Place, the gloomy Gloomy Sunday, and the sweet La Luna. I read what a reviewer said about how any other sopranos could sing better than Sarah on La Luna/Song to the Moon. I think that's not true, at all. Just because the singing isn't wagnerish, it doesn't mean it's easy or lacking in technique or whatever he said. I think it's easier to just sing full out operatic like, say, Renee Fleming than singing with so much passion and being lilting without losing any of the voice's qualities (laid back with 'THAT' voice at the beginning and successively powerful at the end). And, duh, she sings classical properly, ffs.And tell me a name of a soprano who could sing How Fair this Place with such grace, without sounding like a screeching steel can.I've also listened to many other versions of Gloomy Sunday. Billie's is weird. Sarah McLachlan's is out of context. Sinead o' Connors' is shabby although the intelligence behind the singing is fine. Only Sarah Brightman's and Bjork's versions are best for my ears.I have introduced her music (from Phantom of the Opera to Dive to Timeless to Harem) to many people, and apparently they enjoy them very much! There is this radio that's a favourite of us where Gloomy Sunday and Time To Say Goodbye are played as much as Bon Jovi's It's My Live and Sophie Ellis Bextor's Take Me Home and Offspring's Pretty Fly. They're good music and enjoyable.Albeit I also like many other sopranos. I like Lucia Popp's interpretation of Richard Strauss' lieders, Christa Ludwig's of Schubert's, Natalie Dessay, Kiri te Kanawa, etc. :
i'm a spanish fan of soul music of the 90's.these days is almost impossible to find a good soul/r cd to purchase. In the 90's i had to buy about 2 or 3 cds per week. Now, with all the rap  hip hop topping the charts,what kind of music could i purchase?  LUTHER, ANITA, LALAH, SMOOTH JAZZ  maybe, some Joe's cd. AND OF COURSE, THIS TERRIFIC CD BY mr.BENSON.If you're a fan of good r music and you hate the hip hop music, buy this cd NOW!!!!  You won't regret!
I just bought this on CD as it was on sale through the CD club.  I have the original vinyl, but hadn't listened to it in years.  This is one of the best works of music ever conceived, written and performed.  It is absolutely timeless and each song impresses you more than the last.  Put this one on repeat and let it play three or four times. It just keeps getting better.Stevie is an awesome talent and this may be his best.  Don't forget how great music was in the 70's.  This work is one of the major reasons for the resurgence of 70's music today by artists that weren't even born then.  You can see quite clearly the artists that followed Stevie.  Most recently Alicia Keys who would be the first to say his music is pure inspiration
I just refreshed my ears listening to "Riot" again! Getting to to hear 1/2 Full, which clocking in at just over 4 minutes, is sheer electric blues magic. The price of this album is worth this one rocker alone. It was nice to see it on "Easy Street" (along with Lukin' Excellent!)any way this number totally kicks!   Definitely get this if you don't already own it.   
This is my favorite jazz album of all time.  Put simply, this was Miles Davis at his best.  The notes on this album simply float, and yet it flows together better than anything I've ever heard.  The composition is disorganized but in a way that it all makes complete sense.  Don't let the thirty second clips fool you.  I almost missed out on this because the clips are misleading.  I took a chance on it, and it was the best gamble I've ever made.  A must have for any jazz enthusiast
Some of the catchiest melodies and harmonies ever from Curt. Lots of cool instrumentation. Pete Anderson did a great job with the production. This hasn't left my CD player since I got it 4 days ago
Grew up on this group. Love them then and love them now. Own the Best of Collection but you can never compile the best on one CD. For those Winans fans you know what I'm talking about. These brothers are music genuises especially Marvin Winans. Like Stevie Wonder they were ahead of their time. My favorite song on this album shares the message of all times. Together We Stand opens up the eyes to all race,religion, and creed that its time to come together if we want to see a change in this world regardless of background. Entire album is great including the celebrity appearances such as Stevie Wonder, Teddy Riley, and Aaron Hall.  I like the flavor the cameos add to this album. If you're into mid-tempo music this is the album to purchase
For those who have only heard the hits this is a fine addition for your collection.  Bruce and the boys were young and completely up to the task of handing out the long jams you find here.  The title sums up the overall feeling of the songs.  There's a certain joy and a ton of fun to be had.  Put this on one nice warm spring day and see if it doesn't lift your mood.  Caution: must be listened to while drinking a cold domestic beer
I like every song but 1 on this CD. They're the same ones that're on the movie and if you don't like the movie, you probably wouldn't like the CD
John Michael Mongomery is back with a big bang.  This album is one of the best to come out this year. It's better than that of Travis Tritt, Alan Jackson, and Kenny Chesney.  The song I wanna be there is one of the most touching songs since Alan's Where Were you.  He mixes the soulful ballads, with his country rockers, and sweet love songs.  THis is vinatage JMM and should be bought by any true country music fan
Although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys, the PBBB is where the hippy generation,(this is a couple years pre-San Francisco, and before the Stones and Beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record),learned to JUST PLAY. Their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time, and is the single greatest influence on what became the San Francisco sound of the late 60's and early 70's, (REALLY long and experimental jamming), so this is in fact the roots of the roots of the roots of todays jam bands and guitar-heavy blues bands, mixed-race bands, and, for all practical purposes, the white-blues-man in todays' world
Ok, i just could not resist coming on here to review this. I've had this CD for about 4 years now and I STILL listen to quite a bit, proof right there that this CD is definetly a classic (in my book at least) Every single song on here is original, the guitar riffs are simply amazing, and the lyrics i can not even describe in words how much they hit home and how breathtaking they are. If your a Goo Goo Doll fan, and you still do not have this CD, i deeply encourge you to go buy it now! This is The is The Goos like you've never heard them before. The CD is pure genius, and in my opinion the best cd i've ever heard
This has been my first cd of Rod Stewart and I am very proud to have this cd,because worth every penny. This CD has class. Congratulations to the men behind. The duet with Cher "Bewitched, Bothered  Bewildered" is the best song.duet with Queen Latifah "As Time Goes By," I was astonish, She has a nice voice TOO!!. All songs are relaxings. Actually ,I listen  this cd before to go bed
Actually haven't heard this CD, yet, I can still comment on part of it. I was the lucky guy who did the live recording at the X-Ray Cafe.   Sold the masters to the band a couple years ago and just now got around to thinking, "I wonder if they ever did anything with those masters?"So, I was there at the show and can say that every ounce of energy that the band put out (which was considerable since this was the last show on their tour,  but they knew the X-Ray was special and gave it their all)- It was all captured on these recordings.  The machine was a Tascam 688 that used standard cassette tapes for 8-channel recordings. Most all the mics were either Shure SM57/58, but there was also a high quality Shure stereo mic overhead that was mainly used for capturing the drum kit but also provided a nice stereo image of the stage.  The X-Ray was perfect for this type of recording. The tiny PA was only used for the vocals, so, there was no competing with a PA blasting everything.  I would place a SM-57 close to every amp.  Had a nice specialtiy bass mic, too.  Usually, 8 channels was enough to catch everything, but, there were extra inputs where it was possible to stack multiple mics onto a single track if needed. Because of the overhead stereo catching the drums, this was rarely needed.With a full house, such as the night with The Gits, any reflecting waves were just soaked up by the body mass of the crowd, creating what turned out to be a very nice intimate recording space.  There was split box on stage which fed all the mics to the X-Ray "business office" next door, which is where the Tascam was setup away from any real danger.  All of which made it a fun gig to record in comfort and be able to also go over to the stage side and enjoy the show.  Every once in a while, magic happened.D. FletcherPortland, OR
It's fair to say that all orchestras are not created (or built) equally and these discs of phenomenal playing with the Berlin Philharmonic under the baton of Herbert von Karajan are simply some of the best classical recordings ever made.Analog sound was at its peak when these records were made in 1976 and 77 and DG has done an excellent job of remastering them for CD. But beyond that Karajan simply "gets" the composer--as another reviewer pointed out--and conducts with an intensity and passion he seldom showed in his other recordings and performances.I'm listening to these discs once more on a massive sound system with doubled speakers to handle the '70s Kenwood beast amplifier and love it more than ever. As a reviewer once said of a classic Szell/Cleveland performance of Beethoven's Third, this is a reading of "blinding virtuosity and strength." As a budget two disc set it is also, incredibly enough, cheaper than those old DG import records we bought (and scratched up) one by one in the seventies. As I've said before, when you listen to a disc like this you realize why you went nuts for this kind of music in the first place. Buy it, blast it, love it, get your Slavic ya yas out!!
This CD has tons of power, and soothing energy. It really shows off how well Part understands the human voice
I've been a Jim Brickman fan for a few years now.  When I saw this CD came out, I could not resist getting it.  It is absolutely amazing and fully worth it.  When I first put it in my stereo, I had to sit there just to listen to the first few tracks without doing anything.  That was how impressive they were.  The title of the album is incredibly fitting.  While my roommate is venting about the latest drama in her group of friends, I have this CD turned up in my own little corner to "Escape" from it all.  I swear I could not have found anything more fitting to be listening to while trying to get away from real life for a bit.  If you love Jim Brickman, or just like soft jazz, or piano music, this CD is a must have
"I have been a Brickman fan since the very first album. Much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos without much "electronic enhancement." Escape is a wonderful album full of songs you might find on his early albums. There are three excellent vocals on the CD that will please fans who favor his more recent work which tends to feature the vocalist over the piano. If you are a Brickman fan, this is a must have album.
  This is a good compilation of AFI's songs over the 10+ years they've been together. It's easily worthy of 10 stars. This CD allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to Sing The Sorrow, and to get more intimate with the band. I havn't purchased this album YET, because I already have all their albums, but plan on it.   The new tracks are from the Answer That, and Very Proud Of Ya era. They've finally been released on CD. This is a cool little feature fo newcomers also.   Anyway, buy this album only if you havn't heard any of AFIs music but want to give it a try
This guy is a freak of nature! Different but in the same vein as Illinoise. I loved it..No fillers to speak of. If you liked some of the more laid back songs on Illinoise!, you'll LOVE this album. Its great regardless.Highlights are:AvalancheAdlai StevensonSaul BellowThe Mistress Witch From McClure Springfiel, Or Bobby Got A Shadfly Caught In His Hair	No Man's Land	The Perpetual Self, Or "What Would Saul Alinsky Do?S
I bought this recording along with Blood on the tracks recently and all I can say is "Doggonit" it don't get any better than this.  They called Elvis the king but Bob Dylan must be  the "Wizard".  Who will tell us great stories when he is gone?
Having read some of the reviews here I just thought I should mention that for those who enjoy punk rock music rather than the sameness of most emo music these days they should definitely check out this band! While the singer (Conor Oberst) does have that emo voice so familiar to many other bands, he utilises it well and his conviction can be heard throughout (unlike a band like Taking Back Sunday)The music is uplifting without being soppy or sentimental, the lyrics are refreshingly different from most punk-politics band and don't come across as just the singer throwing a badly worded hissy fit.If you want to feel sorry for youself go listen to Bright Eyes, if you want to do something about it listen to Desaparecidos
Anyone who had access to a radio in the 80's would know at least two songs by Missing Persons.  Their fun music and amazing flare (Dale did have pink and white stiped hair and it looked great!) make this a good party album.  I also have their album Color In Your Life and most of the songs are great.  Just as an added note, Warren Cuccarullo is now a member of Duran Duran (my personal favorite band) and has been since he appeared on their Notorious album which was released in 1986!!
I was looking for a cd that I could listen to all of the time.  Oh my God, I am breathless.  I was brought to tears as they sang "Mama".  My mother passed away in 2002 and I never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all.  All of Il Divo's songs have touched me in a way that no one else could.  Thank you for touching my heart.  I really recommend that you give this cd a chance.  All of these other people on the board that gave it a low score, obviously need a hearing aid and a heart.  Blessing
When I first purchase this album the first time.  It was Exceptional then and it still is .  Exceptional and Gifted Group these Ladies rule the early 90's.  Some of my favorites Free Your Mind, My Lovin, It Ain't Over till the Fat Lady Sings, just to name a few.  Envogues voices all of them work masterfully together they way a head of their time.  As far as female groups they rank 5 stars in my book following such groups as Supremes, Labelle, TLC the had allot orginiality and appeal that drew people to them because of the voices and their orignal material.  They are trendsetters.Please go buy this CD.  I will buy it again myself.  I have the cassette. I need the CD for my collection.  I know they came out with a new album hopefully this will be a Great album as well.Go Envogue G
This is a Great Classic Rock CD including some timeless songs.  If you like "Summer Breeze" as much as I do and have not heard the remix of it yet, you are in for a pleasent suprise.  A remix album came out in November of 2004 called "What Is Hip" and in my opinion is the best remix album of 70's music that I've ever heard.  Their version of "Summer Breeze" is near perfect.  A modernized, but not over the top version that manages to preserve the true melody of the song with out removing the original rhythm.  The entire album is great too. I have this "Greatest Hits" and the "What Is Hip" CD and simply can't get enough.  Here's a link to the CD.  ENJOY.http://www.amazon.com  --  What Is Hip
Very different, very cool! An awesome CD that all ages in my house (from 13 to 68) really enjoy listening to
Ah, yes, it's Nirvana's "Nevermind" cd, released in 1991. I listen to all 80's pop-metal, or hair metal (Whitesnake, Winger, Van Halen, Y, Dokken) I could go on forever on 80's bands. (Of course there is Rick Springfield, and John Cougar Mellencamp). I am a true rocker here, I know all the true bands out there, I know everything about them. I have reasons for this.But here's the bottom line. Nirvana was a breakthough along with Soundgarden and Pearl Jam back in the early 90's. Millions of people bought those cds. And yes, there were hair bands still alive back then, like Poison, and Firehouse, etc. Firehouse and Poison had alot of success, eventhough it wasn't the 80's anymore.As I can see, alot of my fellow rockers don't really like Nirvana, or Pearl Jam, or Soundgarden. To be completely honest, I like their music, I just don't prefer the music, because I don't like the hard sound. I really like the glam-hair band style.People say: "Nirvana and those other grunge bands killed glam-metal". Yes, I agree that they killed the 80's hair bands, but it's not necessarly their fault. It's a mix between the bands, and the people listenting to the music. Because of grundge music, today's music is quite horrifying, with EMO and other types of music that would've been a nightmare back in those days.Nirvana has a great CD here, but I just don't prefer it. If you are a REAL rocker, you'll listen to all the types of music back then. Don't judge unless you have actually heard it, because you may actually like it.To all rockers- Don't listen to modern music. It's poisoning our people, and no one really understands the true meaning of "the guitar" in today's music. Most of you will understand what I mean, so listen to the classics.Classic rock, and hair bands forever, and even grunge. Keep the classic alive.~The Sicilian Axe Ma
This is a fantastic album. The fact that 5 star reviews are still being submitted over 10 years after its release (and they're not the beatles or u2 or anything) should speak volumes. I have played this CD countless times over the years and I am amazed that I am not sick of it. I am a pretty constant consumer of new music. Get this CD - you won't regret it! (PS I've never done an Amazon review before, but the fact that this has had only 22 motivated me). It is melodic, catchy, uplifting and cheeky - in short, a little piece of musical bliss.
This was the break through record for Pink Floyd that would place them in the super-league. The strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and Dave Gilmore's guitar playing and voice is superb. Production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential. Overall the record works well as a whole yet I do feel 'Money' seems out of place. The problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption.Now don't get me wrong I think this is a magnificent record but is it really Pink Floyd's greatest album, I tend to think not. Is it the greatest record of all time? Most certainly not. Because a records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically great. Because everybody and their grandmother thinks it's great, does not necessarily make it great. The problem with this record is that it sounds of its time, not that that's a bad thing, its just that it does not transcend time. The real indication of a great record is how many people it inspires to make records that sound like it. I can't think of many records that sound like this without sounding retrogressive. Some records released at the same time: Can's "Future Days"(1973); Nue!'s "2"(1973); King Crimson's "Larks' Tongues In Aspic"(1973); Robert Wyatt's "Rock Bottom"(1974); Tangerine Dream's "Phaedra"(1974) are by far more influential and enduring than Dark Side. If you don't own Dark Side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves its five stars, but make sure you buy 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' also. 'Piper' is Floyds greatest, most influential and definitely one of the greatest of all time. Besides, how many people who think 'Dark Side' is Floyd's best have actually heard 'Piper'.
This was the first Punk-O-Rama CD I listened to, and boy I was not dissapointed. Most of the songs on this CD are the type of punk I would listen to, Quite fast and energetic. The best song on the CD has to be either NOFX - Bath of Least Resistance (NOFX being the greatest punk band of all time, of course), or Beatsteaks - Let me in. I heard the Beatsteaks for the first time on this CD and there absolutely bloody excellent. Obviously, The Cd is made complete with songs from the Descendents, Pulley, Pennywise, Dropkick Murphy's. The only let down on this CD is Noise Conspiracy, there song on this CD, well plainly sucks i'm sorry to say. But overall this CD is one hell of a good listen if your into punk. That's all, oh yeah, buy it! by
Neil Young's latest release has some very clever and interesting songs.  They are very political so unless you are a completest who likes Neil Young, if you agree with President Bush, this album will be a turn-off.  For the politically neutral or those who agree with Neil Young this is a good album.  Maybe this is not Neil Young's best but it still is a good album
Gun's  Roses came out in the nick of time. Record companies were mass producing cookie cutter bands and they all sound the same. G made their debut on the music scene in 87 but didn't get big until almost late 88 early 89. Appitite is a true masterpiece. Welcome to the Jungle, It's So Easy, Mr. Brownstone, My Michelle....The list goes on and on. Put it in turn it up to 10 and Rock On! The they made a mistake. they realeased an albums worth of great songs on 2 albums. So instead of another masterpiece they wound up with 2 ok albums. Then they vanished. Anyone who is a fan of the music but couldn't care less about Axl should pick up Velvet Revolver with Slash and Scott Wieland from Stone Temple Pilots
Being a professional dancer as well as a teacher and having seen hundreds of musicals, I must say I rate this as one of the best.  The dancers are fantastic!  the music utterly great, The choice of dances  (from classical to rock) is highly deversified.   CAN'T WAIT TILL I GET IT  SO I CAN PLAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AS WELL AS ROCK THE HOUSE, SHAKE MY  BOOTIE, ETC
Digressing from their first 2 albums, Transmutation(5 stars)and Sacrifist( 5 stars),  Praxis unleashes Metatron.  Trimmed down to a 3 piece with Laswell, Bucket and Brain covering all bases,  Metatron lacks Bootsy's space bass,  Yamatsuka Eye's agonizing screams or John Zorn's out of tune saxamaphoning, but it still rocks. track 1 is a laid back acoustic # and is absolutly beautiful. The album lacks the speed of some of Sacrifist's songs but makes up in phat grooves.  Half of the Collection cd(again 5 stars) is from this album, but with nothing from Transmutation, hmmm.  Instead of going further Ill' say this.... Get THIs Album at alll costs.  Burn copies for friends and spread the gospel according to Praxis
I have to admit that, at first listening, I found some aspects of Ms.Belle's interpretations of these pieces disorienting. However, as I listened to these covers repeatedly, I can now say that I understand better what the vocalist is after. Not that I always agree with her and with George Duke,the arranger/producer, but I agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened. Ms.Belle has immense talent, superb technique, and a clear idea of each piece, and she delivers the goods without faltering or compromise. I admire that a lot in a performer. Her choices ask us for a reaction and we are free to accept or reject what she has offered us. When I first heard these renditions, I was quite stand-offish, but over time I have come to appreciate them more and more - almost to the point of addiction - and am grateful to Regina and George for their strength of conviction as well as their superior musicianship.They do NOT want us to listen in a passive way, they are waiting for our reaction..and God, this is really so,so good....That's the true spirit in which an album should be recorded. I'd encourage you to get this album because it is about strong, powerful and personal interpretations of some great jazz standards by Regina. You may love everything about it, or you may reject aspects of her interpretations. But in any case you will not remain indifferent; you will be enriched by hearing these pieces in a clear and beautifully personal way. That is an important aspect of why I love this imaginative, innovative quality music and why this recording is invaluable. And it cannot be said enough that her backing band is incredible, giving this album the necessary push to take it over the edge. It is a success because it skilfully avoids being categorized. Regina has had the courage to break out of the traditional mould and make a successful cross-over, which some purists may not approve of... Only time will tell....
Okay, take everything that you know about John Squire. Strip away the amazing Stone Roses first album, the not so amazing follow up, the nice brit pop of his work with the Seahorses and picture this as a solo album from a new artist and I honestly think that peoples thoughts on this album would change drastically. They would realize that every track on it is a winner and that the guitar work is amazing and beautiful, the vocals might be grating at first (Think Robert Forster (The Go-betweens) circa Before Hollywood) but that upon repeated listens grows on you and you eventually end up loving. What you expect going into an album has alot to do with how much you like or dislike it and this album is no exception. People should listen to it for what it is and not for what John Squire was...John Squire is an established song writer who has moved beyond what he used to do (who hasn't moved on in 13 years? minus Robert Smith of course!) and now writes beautiful pop songs...John Squire has grown up just like his original audience has and this solo album is the perfect proof of that
This CD is supberb!!  Absolutely fabulous.  I received it timely and have enjoyed listening to it over and over again.  All my deslings with Amazon thusfar have been outstanding.Thanks, AmazonLaura Rig
This was not a waste of Brad's time or mine.  Good job!
Tim McGraw does it again.  It is a great album with some really great songs.  A must have
Wow!  There's sooooo... much to like in this album it's amazing.  The music is mostly upbeat  very catchy--making you want to ( will if no one's around) sing along.  The lyrics are fine, meaningful,  personally touching--about life which is getting faster  faster in the contemporary world, while people are still people with hopes, feelings, needs, desires,  all the rest of what makes people human.  The lead singer, Jennifer Nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice (though a bit twangy in style).  She grabs you quickly for a wild ride--immersing the listener in the musical story she's telling.  I bought the CD based on hearing Baby Girl  Something More (on the TV show Vegas of all place).  Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA show--winning awards as they so deserve.  The range  variety of the songs on the album are good too--from sweet  poignant ballads to wild  spicy soaring.  Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to  the majority could become successful singles.  Yes, the style is their own mixture of influences--the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds, which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive.  And, the trio wrote all the songs on the CD--with Hall the primary author (solo writer on one of them).  How many trios are there with 2 women  1 man?  I wonder if they are unique?  Well, they are unique even if not in that respect--how many bands include a mandolin?.  Of course, country purists may not be happy with them, but the vast majority of listeners ARE.  This has become one of my favorite albums, at the speed of sound.  IMHO, it's terrific
This is my all time favourite Jacksons album. This album, along with `Mama can't buy you love' and anything by Donna Summer were hogging the airwaves during my first visit to the States as a kid.Comprising mainly Jackson compositions (and production), it showed a more mature and funky side of the group, and was far more consistent than their hit filled but patchy Motown works. Filled with their trademark smooth harmonies, lots of horns and Michael's distinctive vocals, the album hit #11 on the billboard album charts (#3 R), was certified platinum and had a smash hit single in `Shake your body (down to the ground)' #7 pop.`Blame it on the boogie' opened the album in style, a funky upbeat disco tune that one couldn't keep still while it played. Other dancefloor anthems are the horn laden `Things I do for you', the frenetic `All night dancin'', and the shimmery `Shake your body' with its distinctive riff, which hinted at future MJ songs like `Don't stop till you get enough' and `Workin' day and night'.For me however, the songs that really did it for me were the ballads.`Push me away' is a lush sun kissed ballad featuring a passionate vocal delivery from Michael, alternating from full voice to falsetto with ease. Great horns!Title track `Destiny' has an acoustic guitar intro which leads into an amazing ballad where Michael declares `if it's the rich life I don't want it/happiness aint always material things'. Great backing harmonies too.`Bless his soul' is simply stunning! Featuring pensive lyrics about trying to do what's right, but never seeming to please anyone. `You just can't please the world and yourself' sings Jackie. This song starts off tender with congas, fleeting horns and strings which after the second chorus builds to a superb climax of `the life you're living is dangerous' and a fab outro of `hey, ha ha ha'.Then comes the final track and my favourite. The dramatic `That's what you get for being polite'. A thumping piano leads to horns and sweeping strings, and then Michael tells us the sad tale of some lonely guy named Jack who wants to be what he is not and would do anything for love. Dazzling instrumentation, a stellar vocal performance from Michael, The cover art was a painting depicting the group with their huge afros, and the original vinyl release folded open like a book with individual shots of the brothers. One of my favourite childhood albums, one of my all time favourite albums, and a classic!
I'll have to accept that even tough I'm not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release, the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there.  For me the band has progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album, it's very melodic and more mature.  Also the acoustic version of "the diary of jane" is amazing.  I personally recommend the songs "breath", "evil angel" and my favorite "dance with the devil"
A friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago, I listened to a few minutes of it and was like "What is this crap?" and I shelved it for a couple months. I then picked it back up and gave it another listen. To my surprise it was really catchy to me. The music (and lyrics) are simple, but thats what I like about them. Theyre simple! This is a great college-rock cd. I plan on checking out more Teenage Fanclub, and I suggest you do the same. Notable tracks are Sidewinder, What You Do To Me, and Is This Music?
I recently purchased this cd again. I once owned it on cassette.Keith is a real smooth old school type singer and his music andsound has sustained very well since it was released in the early90's. If you are building an old school collection with greatsingers this is a good one to have. It's great for romance orwith that special lady.

Recorded 2001 - 2002.It has become all too common that few are taken to task for saying or doing stupid things.  What's worse is that no one seems to care. This is the kind of thing that pisses Lewis Black off. The angrier he gets the funnier he is.I first came to appreciate Mr. Black on the Comedy Central's "Daily Show."  I always felt that there should have been more time devoted to Lewis Black.I wanted more - I needed more - I had to have more!So I went to my "mental health club," Amazon.com and bought every title available.The End of the Universe, Rules of Engagement and Luther Burbank Preforming Arts Center Blues - ( I had already purchased the White Album)Which one is the best?  ALL OF THEM!As I write this review - I realize that I still want more - so I am buying the DVD's.There is nothing dated about this material. In 2006 it is just as - if not funnier than when first released.Please Lewis keep recording it still is not enough!casl
This is my favorite Bob Dylan album. The album begins and ends with two of the greatest songs ever, Like a Rolling Stone and my favorite Desolation Row. Sandwiched in between are some fantastic songs. The album is filled with incredible lyrics,wonderful music, and a mean harmonica. If you want to know why Bob Dylan is a legend buy this album
It's hard to believe this music is more than a quarter century old now. I think it would recieve the same kind of accolades if had come out yesterday. But it didn't. It came out in the summer of 1979. It was the summer before my sophomore year in college, my first summer away from home. For at least a week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select side 1 of "Rust Never Sleeps." It took me at least that long to flip the darn thing over. And then, when I did, for the next week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select Side 2 of "Rust Never Sleeps." My flatmates never complained.Oddly, the songs I see getting the most grief in the reviews here are my faves. You don't really want to do without the swooping lead guitar, contagious handclaps, and hysterically funny yet politically cutting chorus of "Welfare Mothers," now, do you really? As for "Sedan Delivery," I have only the vaguest clue of what it's about, but it's sure a scorcher (and it's still hard to find a job). Allright, maybe we don't need two versions of "Hey Hey, My My," but which one would you delete? As far as I'm concerned, there's only one song here that hasn't withstood the test of time: "Sail Away," which is innocuously pretty, but lacks the bark and bite of even the other acoustic stuff. "Trasher" and "Pocahontas" are both beautiful and mean in just the right amounts and places. Poor Marlon, poor CSN.Do I wax nostalgiac? Perhaps, but not overly so. This remains essential Neil, which is to say as essential as rock 'n roll gets. It still sounds fresh and relevant. And fun. Did I mention fun? In fact, I'm gonna go plunk it on right now, maybe take a breather between "Sail Away" and "Powderfinger" to relive the LP experience. You should too.   
All I have to say is great album
A quality album from Richard. Long time fans will not be disappointed. It will win over quite a few new fans as well with it great guitars and snappy lyrics
This CD is great.  It is a must have.  Picture yourself in the wild or on a lake in a boat and a thunderstorm comes rolling in slowly.  You hear the rain, the thunder in the distance, you sense the storm getting closer.  The storm is over head, loud piercing thunder claps and you duck for cover.  The thunderstorm slowly moves out but the rain is a constant presents.  The thunder rolls on but the wild life moves in, bullfrogs, owls in the distance, all the animals are alive now.  This cd is all in one, the real deal.  It is not all thunder.  I love it.  I also bought Thunderstorm [Rykodisc]; this was a waste of money.  To me, in my opinion it sounds like the storm just knocked the cable out, static and more static. 
I purchased this CD during the lowest time of my life emotionally. Every track brought solace and comfort beyond belief, especially the title track, Deep Peace. I would listen to it over and over, bathing in the lush healing sounds. Each element, from the perfectly balanced vocals to the simple piano and violin motifs, is seemingly structured at a spiritual level. This is more than ambient music, it's true music therapy.
What is the song that is being played when they are handoing out the dance benefit leaflets?Email me at Tarahillyard@aol.co
The Edward Scissorhands score will always be one of my absolute favorite movie scores.  I truly believe this is Danny Elfman's best score and believe me, he's done some great scores!  The music is so moving.  The childrens chorus mixed with the soft bells and strings were absolutely perfect for this sweet, beautiful film.  Even people who haven't seen this film have probably heard the music from it since it is used in so many film previews and commercials.  A must-have for any Danny Elfman and/or Tim Burton fan
Jodeci's Forever My Lady has a problem that most nineties R releases had at that time, if the fast songs were tight then the slow songs suck and vice versa. Jodeci's first CD had some of the finest slow songs to come off of one CD in 1991. Stay, Forever My Lady, Come  Talk To Me, U,and I'm Still Waiting rank with the best but every single fast is hot trash
This book helps toddlers put into context how they fit into the animal kingdom, and the natural things all animals do. It teaches them to be comfortable with - without shame - the move from being a diaper-clad baby to a big kid. The drawings are charming! I bought this book for a friends who runs a day care center and got a very positive reaction
Goth meets Cabaret, or rather Gothic music influenced by Cabaret. Thats the best way to describe this wonderful little release by Projekt. The eleven tracks here provide an introduction to the "dark cabaret" scene, and do so quite well. The first song, Coin-Operated Boy by the Dresden Dolls, is a great start, and the CD continues onward to devious Evil Night Together by Jill Tracy (which sets up a wonderful film noir mood) and on to the darker, electronic dance number Cabaret Fortune Teller by Audra, to a remix of Knock Three Times on My Coffin by Projekt veterans Black Tape for a Blue Girl. Along the way numerous other bands are covered.Sam Rosenthal's side project Revue Noir makes their debut on this CD, with husky feminine vocals provided by Nicki Jaine, who also has a solo song (Pretty Faces) on the CD as well. Personally, I LOVED Revue Noir and find Nicki Jaine's voice to be quite alluring, but I also know some BTfaBG fans who dislike her vocals so you've been warned. But all in all, I think anyone with a task for the dark should check out this CD. At the very least, its a cheap and decent introduction to a whole new style, and thats always a good thing
This is an amazing, beautiful album.  Probably a little more difficult to get into than Streethawk, but after about the 4th or 5th listen, I found it more rewarding.  The music is very dense, and the lyrics are beautifully poetic (it helps that Dan Bejar has chosen to include a lyric sheet in the cover this time).  A great album for any fan of intelligent independent music
(In reference to another review) - The symbol on the cover of Still is the Factory Records logo, Joy Division's record label.  Since I'm in the area....  I've owned this album for about 15 years and it still sounds, in parts, as solid as anything Joy Division ever did.  Some of the live stuff is so-so but studio tracks like The Kill, Dead Souls, Exercise One, They Walked In Line and Something Must Break are damn near worth the price of admission alone.  If you already like Joy Division, thereby showing good taste, this is a great album.  If you find yourself slowly descending beneath the black cloud of depression, Unknown Pleasures should fit.  If you have been there and find yourself wanting out, Closer is the soundtrack.  This album is more varied in mood, for established fans and safer for household pets
I love this soundtrack! It stands alone as beautiful, haunting, alluring, and innocent--just as Griet herself was in the film. Desplat perfectly captured the spirit of the story, enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than stellar.Scarlett Johanssen's acting is superb, as well as Essie Davis and Colin Firth. The story, though, was a bit tired--pretty housemaid/jealous wife/do-nothing husband. Its portrayal of Vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people, even though it is a fictionalized account.The two best tracks on this album are 'Griet's Theme' and 'Colours in the Clouds'. While I'm not keen on seeing the film again, this soundtrack is a treasure. It's a real work of art, second only to Vermeer's work
This is The Jacksons second album for epic and producers Gamble and Huff. It would be their last with Gamble and Huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the play it should. Music's Takin Over, Different Kind of Lady and Do What You Wanna are great, catchy dance tracks. The real greatness here lies in the ballads where Michael's voice is in peak form. Even Though You're Gone and Find Me A Girl are classic ballads. So good, I feel that Find Me A Girl is probably the best Michael Jackson song you've never heard. This is probably Michael Jackson's most overlooked album and its one of his best! The Jacksons all sing together great and you can see why Destiny and Triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded. Overall, great ballads, catchy feel good dance tracks, and Michael Jackson singing his heart out. Get this, you will not be dissaponted
Hayley Westenra, at only 18 years old, is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come. This is an uplifting and at times, spiritual album that shows shades of greatness. Throughout, Westenra's voice is captivating, though the musical scores are at times, sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent. There was an advertising tag on this CD that stated "The female Josh Grobin", but I think a more accurate sentiment would be "a young Sarah Brightman". ODYSSEY is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes, all of which match up well with Westenra's abilities. Bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet, Dell Amore Non Si Sa. They pair up for that one song, but the rest is all Westenra. This is smooth, soothing and easy listening. If you like Brightman, you will truly appreciate the voice of Westenra. 
In Boyz II Men's sophomore album, II, they make attempts to create their own identities with writing and producing this time around escaping producer Dallas Austin and founder Michael Bivins.  This LP begins with the deepest of gratitude on "Thank You" produced by the group and Dallas Austin.  Both "All Around The World" and "U Know" are mid-tempo tracks with a hip-hop flavor to them, but neither of the two is strikingly memorable or highlights.  One thing they do is provide another angle for Boyz II Men.  For a more relaxing environment, "Vibin'" has a rather simple instrumentation, lyrics and vocals.  "I Sit Away" is a hidden gem with a mid-tempo flow with soothing lyrics written by Tony Rich and production by veteran L.A. Reid and Tony Rich.  Stepping into a more modern jazz feel "Jezzebel" strengthen the groups range and abilities as the album is nearing a completed overall goal.  Over a piano solo, Boyz II Men harmonize on "Khilil (Interlude)" to shift the gears down to their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins with "Trying Times" written and produced by Wanya Morris, Tim Kelley  Bob Robinson.  Hit maker Babyface lends a hand on two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights "I'll Make Love To You" and "Water Runs Dry".  Heavyweights Jimmy Jam  Terry Lewis add a touch of love and mood setting material on "On Bended Knee".  "50 Candles" drives this album to epic proportions with its thriving bass and lyrical content "...feels like one of those nights..."  They show and prove why for their time there are no other male groups that can compare to their beautiful harmony and range as on "Yesterday" they perform accapella.  If real talent that you seek, members Shawn, Michael, Nathan and Wanya has uncompromising talent for any age, era, or time that you can enjoy for long time.   
to set the record straight, rodney 'darkchild' jerkins produced ONE song on this album, and that is 'he said'.that said, producer waryn 'baby dubb' campbell [also husband of erika, younger of the duo] did a great job on this album.  not at all to say that the ladies' singing hasn't always been phenomenal.the highlights of this album include the aforementioned darkchild song, a guest apperance by fred hammond on 'this love' [their appearance on his album, speak those things' is duly noted], an impressively done cover of stevie wonder's 'you will know', and a cover of walter hawkins' 'thank you'.  yes, that is the original sampled at the end of the song.every album that mary mary has released to this day [yes, all two of them] has proven that gospel music can be musically current-- impressive-- and still within taste.  that's what happens when you have the best on your team...baby dubb, while being mary mary's resident producer can also be found on kierra sheard's 'let go', 'sweetest thing', 'all i am', fred hammond's albums 'speak those things' and 'somethin' 'bout love' and countless other records.the downside:  the last two songs.  they're of forgettable quality.  while happy, forgettable.  overall, this album is an essential
If you think yer gonna puke everytime you have to suffer through a "country" song from Nashville these days, and you happen to like classic rock, you would probably appreciate what Shooter's trying to do here. Folks, this is the Real Deal. I don't mean real country or real rock - this is a hybrid - I mean he's making music that is honest and down to earth. A flash in the pan, he's not. He's going to be around for awhile
Tom DeLonge is at it again with a new band and a new album.  Even with being accompanied by the lead guitarist from Boxcar Racer, Angels and Airwaves managed to have a completely different sound.  They dropped the more punk rock tone of Boxcar Racer in favor of an emo-alternative style of rock.  The first released single "The Adventure" is quite enjoyable and even though I haven't checked too deeply into it, I think it's the theme song for NBC's Studio 60.Besides, how can you go wrong with an album that's gone double platinum in the UK and gold in Canada
After watching the movie walk the line, I wanted to hear more of Johnny Cash. All these years(35 of them) I always thought he was just a slow folk singer. His music is non-stop foot tapping soul grabbing stuff. He toured with Elvis Presely and Jerry Lee Lewis. He inspired musicians like Bob Dylan. I am so glad I bought this CD. It's the best purchase I made all year. 
Well it's not quite as good as Rising which is the best album ever but it's still amazing.1.Man On The Silver Mountain- 10/10 This track is a classic and is still played at every Dio concert and Ritchie Blackmore still performed it at every Rainbow concert until Rainbow disbanded in 1997 but anyway this may be Ritchie Blackmore's strongest riff ever! and Dio's vocal performance is excellent. Anyway it's a great fantasy song by Dio and Blackmore and still got radio play so it appeals to everyone.2.Self Portrait- 10/10 Excellent dark song by the band which fits Dio's voice perfectly another classic!3.Black Sheep Of The Family- 8/10 Good song but not a Rainbow song it's a cover and that's a shame because I would have loved to hear Dio's brilliant lyrics another original song but anyway still a good listen4.Catch The Rainbow- 10/10 Another classic from this album as Dio shows how well he can sing ballads as well as epics and rockers. Blackmore has a solo full of feeling and this was performed at every Rainbow concert until Dio left the band.5.Snake Charmer- 10/10 Another song that takes place in the middle ages which is Rainbow's trademark. Anyway this song is very underrated and should have been a classic. Dio has brilliant lyrics and vocals as usual and it's no suprise that Blackmore supplied excellent solos and riffs for this one6.Temple OF The King- 10/10 Here is the best ballad of all time!!! Ronnie's vocals are perfect for this song and his lyrics are amazing too. Blackmore throws togethor and a great arrangemant and solo aswell to make this maybe the best track on the album.7.If You Don't Like Rock N Roll- 8/10 Kind of cheesy lyrics but a good track and it sounds more like an Elf track.8.Sixteenth Century Greensleeves- 10/10 Great song! A real classic as Dio puts togethor another great fantasy song. Blackmore's riffs is brilliant and his solo is full of bends and shredding.9.Still I'm Sad- 10/10 Well the version with vocals is much than this instrumental version but this version is brilliant too. The live version off On Stage however with Dio's vocals blow it away. I still wonder why there weren't any vocals on this.The band isRonnie James Dio- vocalsRitchie Blackmore- GuitarGary Driscoll- DrumsMickey Lee Soule- Keyboards, Piano, MellatronCraig Guber- Bass2
I like the main voice(s) and I like the music, but the voices are over powered by the music. If they turned up the voices a bit I think this would be a great album.This album does not sound like other albums I have so I'm not sure what to compare it to.
The title gets it right - this is a very fun album. There are a lot of great songs on here. Infectious lyrics and music - it still surprises me that Matthew Sweet isn't more popular than he is.One other thing...it's a sin that "We're The Same" wasn't a bigger hit than it was. Truly a great song
This CD is truly a classic and one of my all-time favorites. Love it
This CD is perfect for driving.  The Downtempo/Beat Driven Ambient feel and overall togetherness of this CD is a perfect choice for easy electronic listening.Overall very pleased with Mr. Schnauss' contribution to the genre.Highly reccomende
Rare are the electronic albums that are so consistantly inspired. Melodies are beautifully simple and soothing, sounds are particularly well crafted. A great album.The drum box could be a bit more discreet though
Every listen I get more into this CD. Many catchy songs. I now need to buy more of Donald's solo stuff. Great music
I just saw this woman live and she's amazing!!!! The songs come alive when you hear them! It's hard to put into words the state that her music and lyrics put you in. But trust me it's a good place!Please check her music out if you're into heartfelt music
What can I say that most of the people reviewing this cd haven't already said.Arthur is OUTRAGEOUSLY talented. It's almost shocking.The depth of songwriting and production values are so intense. It's extremely well recorded and mixed music. Anyone into audio manipulation should just buy all of his albums right now."Stumble and Pain" is probably my favourite track. The sinister tone of it and the synth effects are just superb.As with all Arthur albums the vocals are dense, layered, and its something he's obviously worked on for a long time and it really pays off on this album!Anyone new to him should buy this immediatly and buy redemption's  son straight after that.WHAT A MUSICIAN
First up I give this album a 4.5/5 for the fac that it has REAL hiphop beats and good lyrics. Real hiphop, they stayed true to the sound. I just didnt give it a 5 since im not the biggest TCQ fan and of that style. But all these emcees spit hott lyrics in this album. Tracks like "Keep It Movin", "Hot Sex" have ill beats. This album does have a real jazzy sound to it, which im not the biggest fan of, but its more of a unique style, and they deserve props for trying new styles. So overall this is a really good album, and worth getting. My Top 5 Songs1.Buggin Out2.Hot Sex3.Oh My God4.Luck Of Lucien5.Keep It Movi
Try to name some of the greatest debut rock albums.  Let me give you one ground rule though:  It has to be from a band that put out at least five albums (so no Stone Roses, Sugar, Verve or Jane's Addiction, e.g.).  Here are some of mine, off the top of my head: Led Zeppelin I, In the Court of the Crimson King, Days of Future Passed, The Doors, Boy (U2), C.S.N., Can't Buy a Thrill (Steely Dan), Ten (Pearl Jam), Murmur (REM).  I'm sure there are a number of others that I'm forgetting.  Oh yeah, one more: the incredible "Ferment," by Catherine Wheel.The harmonies and swirling lush guitar sounds created by Rob Dickinson and Brian Futter, the compelling rhythms generated by Dave Hawes (Bass) and Neil Sims (Percussion), it just all works, and is comparable in every way to the extraordinary "Nowhere" by Ride (not quite as great as "Loveless" by My Bloody Valentine).  Unfortunately, C.W. never quite matched the power of "Ferment" with their subsequent releases.The best song on the album is "Black Metallic" ("it's the color of her skin/ her skin is black metallic") which soars up to the sky, floats in the wind, lands, and soars again.  Clearly, "Black Metallic" clocks in as the band's "Stairway to Heaven."  The second best song on "Ferment" is . . . well that's where it gets tricky, and demostrates how great this album is.  There are no weak or even average songs, and I could see where anyone of the others can be considered as a runner up to "Black Metallic."  Put a gun to my head and I would have to go with "Shallow" or maybe "Tumbledown" or perhaps, if I'm in a more pop oriented mood, the danceable "I Want to Touch You."  Although, last night, as I was listening to the album in preparation for this review, I thought of how strongly it closes with the trio ""Bill and Ben," "Salt" and the uplifting "Balloon" ("ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon").A wonderful album.  Perhaps not in my top ten, but definitely in my top twenty (tied with the aforementioned "Nowhere")
I bought a copy for a friend recently and she said "His music sounds so fresh and it's so singable.  The lyrics are meaty, too, not just fluffy pop. I'm kind of obsessing over this music right now--which is fun!  Thanks so much... I'd like to see him in concert sometime." I had this album for a year before I really got into it, since it takes a couple of listens to really appreciate.  At first listen I really liked We'll Do It All Again, and put it onto my MP3.  A year later I finally got the album out again and it bleu me away.  I realize that there is something slightly Barry Mannilowish about We'll Do It All Again, because he has some lungs, not because of style or anything.  He reminds me more of Jellyfish, or They Might Be Giants.  Some songs are so pathetic, vulnerable, and a little too honest for comfort as far as lyrics go, but they are energetic and hopeful in their delivery.  Anyone who appreciates art for arts sake will probably like this album.  The songwriting is superb and precisely produced. The second hidden track is a real gem, that you don't need to relate to in order to appreciate.  The lyrics are clever and fun even though several songs have a theme of loneliness.
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth came out of no where with this classic in "92". I was expecting the T-ROY tribute to be the only highlight, but this joint was bangin! The very underrated CL had the dope metaphors and complex lyrics. Chocolate Boy Wonder had the legendary "horns" going on. The whole album is a banger. Fav's are Pete's Sake, The Basement(Pete's cuz Heavy D rips  it), Mecca and the Soul Brother, Troy- They Reminisce, Straighten it Out( a kick in the balls for bootleggers), Ghetto's of the Mind and Skinz(CL's cuz Grand Puba steals the show on this one). Eternally Classic, rock on.
I've had this cd since it came out and it continues to be my favorite.  It's a cd that I can put in anytime and thoroughly enjoy.  This would be my pick for the cd to have while stranded on an island.  It never gets boring and made me appreciate just how good Schon is.  Unbelievable. If you like this, you'll like Eric Johnson's Venus Isle album too.  Two of my all time favorites
It doesn't get any better than this. This album is a must have for all true Judas Priest fans. This is Priest when they were really getting good. The guitars and the vocals rock you to the core
This might be the best CD that has come out this year.  It may be Will Oldham's best CD since "Viva Last Blues." It may be better than "Viva Last Blues" although these are two different styled CDs.  "The letting go" has a mostly very mellow sound.  Almost every song is beautiful.  The string and guitar melodies are uplifting.  Will Oldham's voice is grounding, it is the familiar voice you have heard for the past decade or so.  Dawn McCarthy's voice will then again lift you up.  McCarthy's voice is a fantastic companion to Oldham's.  Other singers/bands have tried to use a female voice to echo or accompany the lead vocal and it has often become irritating.  This is not the case with "the letting go," McCarthy's accompaniment adds so much to the album but without taking away from Oldham.  I haven't listened to a Will Oldham album since "Ease down the Road." This makes me want to go back and listen to those albums I have missed.  One song in particular, "The Seedling" (I believe) has a different sound than the rest of the album.  It has a harsher sound, but is still a good song.  This is a great introduction if you are new to Oldham or if you are returning listener. 
This is a wonderful effort by the Del Castillo brothers and their band. Mark and Rick are great guitarists and the band is one of the best that I have ever heard. I hate that anyone would compare them to the Gypsy Kings or Strunz and Farrah, because I believe they (Del Castillo) are far superior. Even though I am a huge fan of Santana, I think Brothers of the Castle and Vida are more entertaining and satisfying than Santana's last CD. If you are a fan of this genre, you should possess both Del Castillo CD's.....Brothers of the Castle and Vida. Their live show is among the best that I have ever seen
As he did with "Parade", the soundtrack to his last vanity project "Under the Cherry Moon", Prince provides a musically invigorating soundtrack to "Graffiti Bridge", which is a hopelessly silly film. No matter. "Graffiti Bridge", Prince's first album of the 90's, is also one of Prince's best albums of the 90's."New Power Generation" serves as the title track to Prince's new band, and it's a powerful, funky manifesto. "The Question of U" is exotic and intoxicating. "Elephants and Flowers" is an upbeat song about spiritual redemption, whereas "Tick Tick Bang" is Prince at his most joyously raunchy. Although most of Prince's material is exceptionally strong here, the collaborations and contributions by other artists are a mixed bag. "We Can Funk" is a simmering duet between Prince and funkmaster George Clinton, and Tevin Campbell provides some youthful exuberance to "Round and Round". But the tracks by The Time mostly fall flat. I've personally always found Morris Day to be a one-trick pony with his effete pimp routine, and his one trick gets boring quickly.It's obvious that with "Graffiti Bridge" Prince is trying to create the feel and atmosphere of a funky block party. But I can't help but wonder, without the tracks featuring other artists, if "Graffiti Bridge" wouldn't be more highly regarded as one of Prince's better albums
Even if you don't know much about Donny Hathaway, this collection of songs is a fun mix and it's very moving.  It includes some classics with Roberta Flack that are terrific.  I enjoy it tremendously
At first, I thought the only reason why I wanted this CD was because Idina Menzel was on it. But now, after listening to the whole CD, I was right, Idina Menzel was AMAZING, and all of the other cast members are incredibly talented too.I would HIGHLY recommend this because it is a very interesting story, it's incredibly complex music (theoretically), but at the same time it is VERY enjoyable!!!! I would give it more stars if I could... but I am only allowed 5... :(
This is the stuff that rap dreams are made of!  Just like the movie itself,  this CD is packed with moment after moment of perpetual rollercoaster type thrills that leaves the listener in a sheer state of funk frenzy!  The talent assmbled here is tops and just seems to keep coming at you so,  get in, sit down, buckle up and shut the Fk up because it's about to get rowdy up in here!      
It realy has been a long wait after Jellyfish. This Roger Joseph Manning solo effort is as beautiful as music can get, giving wagonloads of goosebumps all the way. If you have a craving for the ultimate in sophisticate popmusic you should get this rare jewel. And don't wait for the US release: it lacks one song from a perfect 11 like the Japanese has. I sure wouldn't want to miss any of these tracks. Very higly recommended!
I have loved the Swans since my Danceteria days in early 80s New York. But its a fitful, frustrating love. You get the sense from 'Incandesent' that the Swans forgot to stop partying.  That they never took the time to put together more than a handful of songs.  Oh, but what songs they were.  This collection is for completists and aging post-punker (like myself) who wished they'd shared a pint with the boys back when simply getting stoned was a subversive act. Its a nice collection of beautiful, quirky oddities here. But a few gems are missing "Holy Holy", "1982", "World of Milk and Blood" come to mind. Maybe on an 'Ashes' reissue.  In the meantime, scoop this up.  Simpson  Company deserve the attention. If you really care about the band, buy it directly from their label, Renascent. That way the company (and the band) can make a few pennies. Maybe enough to mine the crates for a second hits collection. 
Buy it. Now. Stop reading. Are you still reading???? Okay, so I'll tell you my reason why. Reason(s) why. 5.1 sound. DTS. Different (some versions better to my ears/psyche) than the CD. Flavor. Beautiful production. Did I mention DTS - you gotta hear this in DTS. And she and her band deserve and have earned every penny you could spend on her (gratuitously inciting flaming). I am just hoping that she will give us the opportunity to have DVD's covering her 'Girl in the Other Room' and her 'From This Moment On'.
I love this album, the best of Phil Collins.  I believe every great artist always delivers their best stuff when they are in a rut.  I know he wrote some of the songs on this album bases on his bad times/suffering with his ex wife.  He did not realize how much pain she was in and the mood and moment is captured very well.  He is a great composer.  Too bad most of his new songs...2006, times are different and so is his life, I do not enjoy them as much.  Once an artist becomes more Self-Actualized much of their best work becomes just that a memory.  
  This album sends mixed messages to the listener.  Some tunes are overally happy, some quite depressing. I can only explain it in parts:Radio Song - the first track of the album comes out quite upbeat and rollicking.  A guest vocal from KRS-One makes it quite a lively tune.  Puts you in the mood for a more Green-style album.Losing my Religion - Huh? What's this? The album delves into uneasy angst as a troubled Stipe spills problems out to the listener.  The tortured riff holds out until the end, telling the listener this isn't quite like Green or Document...Low - The depression lingers on.  Low is a tune sadened speech about the absence of love and how it can make you feel so low.  My favorite on the album, I think it's delicate and sad.  My #1 downer tune.Near Wild Heaven - Another uneasy tune that has a touch of angst.  Deals with the apprehension of love.Endgame - A curious tune.  Can't be interpreted either happy or sad, for it is instrumental.  It could go either way, it's written in a major key, yet the melody sounds sobered, almost as if it's a requiem.Shiny Happy People - Takes the listener up to a very uncomfortable level of happiness.  A low point on the album, yet I interprate it by feeling uneasily happy after the anti-pastorial earlier tracks.Belong - One track I don't understand, yet enjoy and see it as a break from the main goal of the album.Half a World Away - Ah, so beautiful.  Essentially about enjoying life's finer moments at the expense of moments to come.  Truly happy, but still holds on to the softcore angst.Texarkana - The lyrics and pulsing bass line make me draw conclusions that it's about unfulfilled life goals.  Delves deeper into seeds of depression until...Country Feedback - The climax of saddness on the album.  This song is excruciatingly sad.  The melody, the lyrics... It kept me awake all night.  One of the saddest songs I've ever heard.Me in Honey - A powerful, joyous ending that basically sums up the fact the everything turns out OK in the end.This album is highly recomended.  R.E.M. are an incredible band.
Evan Dando has once again delivered an astounding collection of pop/punk songs.  This album rocks like Lovey and is almost as catchy as Come On Feel.  I've been listening to this album for weeks on end.
I wore out my tape of Cypress.  Afoot is great, but Cypress is amazing.  I bought this while stationed in the Army.  There weren't too many "new wave" tapes available at the PX, and I wasn't going to listen to Def Leppard or Bon Jovi.  So I bought Cypress.One of those rare tapes that I bought 20 years ago and still listen to every few months (The Jam's Snap and Setting Sons, and The Smith's Hatful of Hollow are 3 other tapes I never tired of). Get this CD.  Get it now!   It is great.   Thanks for reissuing it.
And you will to. This music conveys the happy feeling of Latin music produced for the American ear from 1946 to 1949. I picked up the album from Amazon after listening to selected cuts offered by the Yahoo Music radio service -- "El Cumbanchero" and "Cuban Pete". The cuts are almost all strong and all are well recorded, especially when you compare the sound quality to those on some other big band recordings that have been reissued.   "Babalu" which became Desi Arnez signature piece on the I Love Lucy TV show is probably one of the least appealing, and that may be why it was used comedically in the TV show through the years. The highlight cuts include -- "Peanut Vender", "Holiday in Havana", "You Can in Yucatan" and "Brazil". While brass, strings, drums and guitars tend to dominate much of today's music, this album gives the spotlight to a variety of percussion instruments, flute, clarinet and bass clarinet. It is refreshing to hear them in solo.   The liner notes by Will Friedwald are extensive and give you a glimpse into this period of Desi's life between his movie career and the defining work he and Lucille Ball did on television in the 50's.   I could not recommend this album more and hope you enjoy it as much as I did
I purchased this CD with the intent of finding fine players playing fine music. What I found, however, was and outstanding example of chamber music as its finest. The ensemble these 3 players generate is some of the finest ensemble music playing recorded. Each player displays exceptional technique, both in the mechanical and lyrical aspects of their playing. Most impressive is listening to Istomen who, playing a very technically and lyrically demanding part, voices his playing with such finess and carefull attention to detail to the strings; a feat very difficult to do as a pianist. This is an excellent recording for the professional to study a score from or for the avid listener to play over and over
THIS ALBUM MARKED A RETURN OF SORTS TO THE OLD TRADEMARK ISLEY BROTHERS SOUND,AND IT'S OFF THE HOOK.JAM AND TERRY,STEVE HUFF,RAFEAL SADDIQ,KELLY AND ANGELA WINBUSH ALL TOOK THEIR TURNS PUTTIN' IT DOWN,AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID.FROM THE TIME MOVE YOUR BODY KICKS IN UNTIL THE VERY END THIS ALBUM IS ABSOLUTELY SLAMMIN'.HIGHLIGHTS IN MY OPINION ARE YOU DESREVE BETTER,JUST LIKE THIS,WARM SUMMER NIGHT AND MOVE YOUR BODY.BUT THE ABSOLUTE HIGHLIGHT AND(in my opinion)ONE OF THE MOST SLEPT ON SONGS OF ALL TIMES IS THE TITLE CUT ETERNAL.THAT IS ONE OF MY TOP TEN ISLEY BROTHERS FAVORITES OF ALL TIMES.THE SONG KIND OF REMINDS ME OF MAKE ME SAY IT AGAIN,AND EARNIE SHOWED ALL THE WAY OUT ON THE GUITAR SOLO ON THAT SONG.CONTAGIOUS EVEN HAD A BIT OF THE ISLEYS SOUND AND PROBABLY INTRODUCED THEM TO A WHOLE NEW AUDIENCE.AS A WHOLE,I AM EXTREMELY FOND OF THIS ALBUM
                I appreciate bands like Ima Robot, Film School and electroclash artists for trying to add a little balance into Alternative music, or at least I appreciate Film School for trying to merge the beauty of Electronica with Alternative and allow it to simmer down to the always wonderous shoegazing while bringing back the trend of the New Wave you loved in the 80's. The thing about it is it is bands like these that are adding their own style into music making it worth your minutes and expanding your genres from just on band. Have you heard Depeche Mode's albums with a wind of Boards of Canada?                Call this the album that it would have made more sense for Maximo Park to create if you will but this album is America's response to all other international bands showing us off hard. (The band is from San Francisco, I believe) And their influence for this album is a mix of Electronica and 80's music (My Bloody Valentine. New Order? Depeche Mode?) all leading them to create an album that doesn't quite call the band in question an American Radiohead per se, but with half of the music smothered in swirling guitars, accompanying keyboards, and a leaders effort to push the band forward, a band that is trying to reach heights of originality.                 Film School's debut (if you aren't counting their imported EP) kicks off with am intro wielding only swirls of guitar and electronics before finally bringing you into an illuminating "On and On" that may force your urge to name this band after Interpol and Elefant and a little bit of The Bravery in there, too, but will not let you throughout this entire album. Their current single "Pitfalls" may cause them to swing on the vine of similarity since everyone is trying to bring back New Wave these days, but worse can happen for a band like this. The backward keyboard melody should more than make you tell the difference. The second actual interlude "Garrison" is where Boards of Canada's wind starts blowing through the CD, before heading back into the record that will be likely to redefine the sound of "cool". If there is ever an album to chase after and count on for the safety of New Wave and the health of Alternative, I don't see a better candidate for leg-ups than Film School's latest.Rating: 7.5/1
Without a doubt, this is a must-have for any fan of the Go-Betweens and the place to start if you are new to the band.  "A man far wiser than myself once referred to "16 Lovers Lane" as 'the indie Rumours'" the liner notes say in this fantastic re-issue of the Go-Betweens ultimate set of songs.  No truer words were ever spoken about this amazing set.  Why this album didn't spawn at least five top 10 singles is a mystery that will never be solved.  But needless to say this is a fantastic set made even better by the wonderful packaging and extras included with this re-releaseFor those of you unfamiliar with the Go-Betweens work, this was the consummate work of their 80's heyday, for a great many reasons.  The music is bright pop music, crystal clear, but in no way is it featherweight pop.  The songs are beautifully arranged, every instrument, vocal, handclap, and anything else perfectly placed with not a note out of place, but this can be said of nearly every Go-Betweens release.The lyrics, plaintive ruminations on love, are clearly written by two songwriters/lyricists going through the opposite sides of relationships.  I will not go into detail here as the liner notes tell the story, but the interplay within the band as these relationships play out are what drove the entire release.  Each lyricist, Grant McLennan and Robert Forster, gets about half of the album's lyrics, and that is what makes the CD special.  Images of the giddyness of new love ("Love Goes On!") are juxtaposed with images of love lost in such as way as to be almost shocking.  "I'm ten feet under water/standing in a sunken canoe/looking up at the water lillies/they're green and violet blue/still the sun it finds/a place to light me" from "Love Is a Sign" has to be one of the best descriptions of how it feels when a relationship falls apart that has ever been placed in song.  These themes are repeatedly dealt with in different ways, from young lovers meeting and breaking up to the "old" love of couples with children ("You Can't Say No Forever") having a fight.The bonus material in this handsome double-disc set is truly welcome.  The videos to "Streets of Your Town" (still undoubtedly the best song on this incredible collection) and "Was There Anything I Could Do?" underscore the relationships going on in the band while not seeming too terribly out of date.  The bonus disc of outtakes and b-sides is also a fantastic addition to the set as it includes several songs that didn't make the final album cut but are presented as they were at the end of the recording sessions, being nearly complete but having that rough edge of a final demo.The real treat come with the acoustic "demos" that are included.  "You Won't Find It Again," "Apples in Bed," and "Head Over Heels" are played only by McLennan and Forster on acoustic guitars, providing for an intimacy that is unmatched anywhere.To top it all off, the packaging (including an awesome essay by British songwriter Andrew Male) is exquisite, providing detail on the circumstances surrounding the album as well as any pertinent recording information.This is "16 Lovers Lane" as it was meant to be heard--enjoy!
My son loves music and really likes Dan Zanes.  We started with the videos on Disney and the "catch that train" song really got us singing, so we ordered this CD.  Now my son sings along with it, dances and jumps around.  Dan Zanes really is fun for the family
I was looking for some music I could play in the car or around the house with my 19-month-old son and came across this one--the exact same "album" that I had when I was his age!  I'm so glad they redid it!  One of my fondest memories
Gene Watson was one of the finest voices in country music, and this compilation of 18 hits provide a fine sampling of that voice.  Considered by some to be "hard country", I find Gene Watson to have a more "pop" oriented voice that combined well with his selection of songs;  and in the '70's, that proved to be enough to keep him on the charts.  While many of the songs on this album are pure country, others are the typical, drab, 70's pop that filled the void between the Nashville Sound and the New Traditional era of the 80's.  In any case, there is no doubt that Gene Watson earned his spot in Country Music, and this collection carries those hits that made him the household name he is today;  including his signature songs "Farewell Party" and "Love in the Hot Afternoon".  If you prefer the more traditional country sound, his "You Could Know as Much About a Stranger" and "Should I Come Home" are also included
Gene Watson's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for Sonny James, Ernest Tubb, and Dottie West.  I had never heard of him but then when I heard his voice on the CD I knew the songs.  It's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should.  Every song is great but the one which I really like is The Old Man and His Horn.  This was a song I had never heard.  It also shows the versatility of Gene's song selections.  He has the best voice of any country singer I have ever heard
Honestly, Led Zeppelin is the ONLY artist that can create monumental album after monumental album and have not ONE bad song.  When you listen to one of their albums in your car, there's no, "Oh, I really like track 2, but I don't like the next couple, so I'll skip to track 5 after that one's over."  Now it is common opinion that the classic albums of Led Zeppelin are the first five, and "Houses of the Holy" is the fifth one.  This is Zeppelin at their pinnacle, which in my opinion, they never fall from."The Song Remains the Same" is Pagey at his best with his Gibson double-neck.  The song itself makes you want to ride the wind because it is so airy, but at the same time a fast-paced rock tune.  Page's initial (and INCREDIBLE) guitar solo makes this song the perfect initial song on this album."The Rain Song" is a lovelorn masterpiece with the lovely sounds of an orchestra to help create this mood.  The lyrics are deep, and while the song to me is melancholy, it is also refreshing."Over the Hills and Far Away" is a 5-trillion star song, with amazing acoustic and electric guitars with mystic lyrics."The Crunge" is groovy and funny.  The bass is really felt in this song, and odd spoken lyrics at the end give a laugh."Dancing Days" is very far out, but a summer-y song with an addictive riff."D'yer Mak'er" is one to definitely highlight Bonzo's masterful rhythm skills, or in other words, GREAT DRUMS!  Equal to that is Pagey on guitar and Robert's singing, "I still love you so...but I can't let you go...""No Quarter" is the quiet masterpiece that is credited to John Paul for an exquisite keyboard solo."The Ocean" is quite the upbeat song on this album with a raunchy riff.  An overall energizing song.This is the best deal for this album--do not pass it up!  I hope this will be a permanent fixture to your collection...not one bad song
This is a great cd with many good songs as it is one of my favorites and bruce rules
low tech and brilliant, music that seems to have channeled Zappa, Winchester Cathedral, and god knows what else.  incredibly funny, and then suddenly sad.  mr pink is a genius, you betcha.  and he explains what it is and how it is to live here in this strange quasi-city in the shadow of the industry, in the curiously full and fun wasteland of other people's dreams
Trace Adkins has set them up and knocked them down once more! Can Trace ever produce any music that sounds bad? His low deep bass voice continues to tickle our ears and the message of the songs he chooses to put together on cd continue to proclaim loud and strong that he loves everything in life from his dog to his woman to his God! I strongly recommend that everyone has Trace's latest CD in their collection! A big ten-four in my CD player
 "The Dreaming was one of those albums that I found in my parents CD collection when I was young and I haven't outgrown it yet. My parents seemed to hate it and never bought a Kate Bush CD after it (though I recently bought her whole collection except "The Whole Story" as it's just a greatest hits!). This album took me a very long time to get into however. I listened to it several times as a child and then put it away because I thought it was too strange. I took it out then several years later and loved it. I would now say it could be my all time favourite CD and is better than "Hounds Of Love" as I see it. The songs all stand on their own and Bush's voice is brilliant and her quirky themes shine through. This is the only album that I will never skip a track because I'm always in the mood for them all. 1. "Sat In Your Lap"- A great opening track. Bush deals with whether she can be bothered to do something or not. The instruments are great as always. 2. "There Goes A Tenner"- A notable song for the quirky British accent Bush puts on. The instruments are very good and remind me of the '80's (as it was made then!). That was a good decade for music! 3. "Pull Out The Pin"- The piano arrangement is excellent in this song and the chorus is so good. The lyrics are about someone who is in war and thinking about pulling out the pin of a grenade. The song was inspired by a documentary. 4. "Suspended In Gaffa"- I don't actually know what Gaffa is but this song is still so great and catchy. The lyrics are quirky and the instrumentation is excellent. 5. "Leave It Open"- An excellent song that reminds me more of "Hounds Of Love". The instrumentation is excellent as always. 6. "The Dreaming"- Another brilliant song which is so funny because of Bush's Australian accent. The production is good and so is the songwriting. 7. "Night Of The Swallow"- The use of Irish traditional music is a nice effect to this song. The singing by Bush is superb and the song is flawless! 8. "All The Love"- The song has a sadder feel to it but is excellent. The lyrics are unusual and very well done. The instruments complement Bush's superb voice and never overtake! 9. "Houdini"- The album cover is to do with this song. The song is excellent with a really quirky chorus and good instrumentation. 10. "Get Out Of My House"- A perfect way to end an amazing album. The lyrics are so good and it is so funny at the end when she turns into a mule (within the song obviously). It is something only Kate Bush could have written! Overall I think it is an amazing album though I can see why people don't like it. It could be a little too experimental for some though for me it is perfect. Kate Bush shows she was the original alternative female and the best (yes, she's better than Tori Amos). She is one of the few geniuses of music and an all time amazing artist. Reccomended to everyone into alternative, especially Tori Amos fans! MARK- 10/1
What else can be said about this great CD?  It's one of the best pop records ever made and you never get sick of hearing these 10 songs. "Child of Vision" is the best (the piano solo is killer) of the best, but this is one of those rare CD's that you just pop in and let the entire thing play till the end (no skipping over songs you don't like). A true classic
A lot of music fans have mused over why Matthew Sweet did not achieve greater success with the masses despite his obvious ability to write very catchy songs. "Sick of Myself" single-handedly rejuvenated my faith in the power of pop music at a time when pop seemed to have exhausted its possibilities. But in retrospect Sweet simply wasn't a very marketable commodity for the music industry, and on top of that his vocals and lyrics somehow didn't grab people. Its not that he doesn't sing with passion or feeling, but somehow the words seem to get lost in the mix. Perhaps its a production thing; regardless, the vocals on a MS album always seem to be secondary to the music and that is a no-no for any great singer-songwriter. There are some truly impressive (albeit derivative) stuff here: "What Matters" is in my opinion the greatest Byrds song never written, "Hide" is a beautiful piano ballad that wouldn't seem out of place on Badfinger compilation, "If Time Permits" has some of the most beautiful chorus harmonies not written by Brian Wilson, etc. etc. "I've Been Waiting" works well in combining catchy melody with plaintive adolescent desire, and "Girlfriend" is for the most part a great rocker. However, after the relatively simple production of Girlfriend, his later albums got bogged down in an attempt to recreate a "wall of sound" feeling, which quite frankly doesn't really work unless you're Phil Spector. Not much here can be completely discounted and the new songs fit in quite well (although I probably would have included "Evangeline" at the expense of "Ready"). Despite the undeniable quality of the music there is nothing life-changing here and ultimately great music must at least have the semblance of being life-changing. Still heartily recommended for fans of catchy, melodic pop-rock
Really nothing on this is bad. The best IMHO is Rubyhorse, the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Subways but a case could be made for any of the songs. The only problem is now I have 8 other CDs I need to buy
After Trouble and his Austin City Limits appearance, I thought he was just another very good singer songwriter.  This follow up has made me reconsider, because this is the work of a very thoughtful perfectionist.  He waited and it was worth the wait.This reminded me immediately of John Lennon (please don't punish me for blasphemy) and others that knew how to touch you with simplicity done in a classy way.I didn't expect something this deep for a sophomore recording.  Enjoy
The title gets it right - this is a very fun album. There are a lot of great songs on here. Infectious lyrics and music - it still surprises me that Matthew Sweet isn't more popular than he is.One other thing...it's a sin that "We're The Same" wasn't a bigger hit than it was. Truly a great song
I've been a Robben Ford fan since 1979. Each time he offers a new recording, I try to purchase it as quickly as possible. Robben can ROCK and play slow blues. Every cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again. I can't say enough! Robben is one of the least known and treasured guitartists of our generation! If you like Robben Ford, don't miss Chris Cain. This man is also a guitar genius
I'm a horn performance major, and I bought this box set because I needed recordings of all of Beethoven's symphonies but at a low cost.  Now first off, yes, they sound great.  However, I've noticed a problem in the first movement of the fifth symphony: Karajan changes Beethoven's orchestration!  Allow me to explain:The horn players at the time would have been using valveless horns -- instruments bound to the overtone series.  On the "natural" or "hand" horn, pitches that fall on the overtone series can be played without adjustment (like a bugle) but any other note must be bent into tune by using the right hand to close off the bell.  This technique was effective in allowing the horn to play most chromatic pitches, however, the "stopped" notes have an entirely different tone color; most composers favored "open" pitches, especially for symphonic works.In the exposition, the second theme is announced by a call in E-flat by the horns.  However, in the recap, the same call must be in the tonic (C), as dictated by sonata form.  The horn part is written for E-flat horns, which meant they would have been tuned so that the harmonic series emphasised E-flat major, the relative major.  The E-flat call of the exposition falls entirely on partials the hornists can play with no significant adjustment -- they are all "open" notes.  However, in the recapitulation, the C call would include two "closed" notes if it were played by the E-flat horn.  The horns could change crooks and become C horns, in which case the call would again be all open partials, but Beethoven does not do this; I am uncertain whether he wanted the horns in E-flat for the transition, leaving them no time to change, or if it was simply not yet common practice to change crooks in the middle of a movement.  For whatever reason, Beethoven left the horns in E-flat and rather than writing the call in the horns again, which would include stopped pitches and have a very different sound, Beethoven moved the call to the bassoons.In Karajan's recording, the second theme is announced by the horns in both the exposition and the recapitulation.  Granted, if Beethoven had been writing for our modern valve horns, he might have written both calls in the horn section.  There is no way to prove for certain that this is the case, however.  It strikes me as very arrogant to "correct" Beethoven's instrumentation, and I feel that a respect for historical accuracy by preserving the master's writing is a more prudent performance choice. 
This is the album that all Kenny G fans have been waiting for!!! It was well worth the wait too. Not only is Kenny G at the top of his game but the vocalists are GREAT! The entire group of artists is so eclectic. Thank you Kenny G!!
To be honest I can't think of a word that can explain the emotional link with this album apart from it being the most beautiful sound I've heard. For me listening to this album makes me feel emotionally confused but absolutely complete at the same time, never before has an album stopped me in my tracks as firmly as this one. My favourite songs on the album are "the only moment we were alone" and "six days at the bottom of the ocean" every time my ears are blessed with these artworks I'm am fixated on nothing else but them. I literally cannot communicate with anyone or anything I just have to listen to them intently. This album is not as experimental as "those who tell the truth shall die those who tell the truth shall live forever" but I feel it is just as good and the songs are put together impeccably well, with no song being neither longer nor shorter than it has to be. I love the pure, clean sound of this album and see it as light as the wind. The trance that this album provides is indescribable; I'm not saying if you buy this album it will have this exact effect on you this description is merely from a personal note. Either way I strongly recommend this band and album to anybody who is looking for a purchase, for you can have no doubt that this album is extremely well produced, written, recorded, thought out and sounding. Buy it, you will not regret your choice one bit.   
The one song I know is a remake is "Goodnight My Love."  I know this because I have it on the original 45 issue and the CD version is an inferior remake.  But the others with which I'm familiar - but don't have original vinyl to compare, only memories - seem authentic.The audio quality is great and certainly superior to some of the CDs you find these days which are only re-recordings of old vinyl or cassettes.
I bought this CD after I'd watched the movie the first three times. The music is wonderful.  I bought it specifically for the song they sing in the church scene - "I Don't Care to Stay Here Long" and I want it played at my own funeral way out there in "someday".  You can't hear it without smiling and the words are much easier to understand on the CD than in the movie.  But just in case, here's the first foot-stompin' verse:Fare -- well, vain world! I'm going home.My Savior smiles and bids me come and I don't care to stay here long. BrightAngels beckon me away to sing God's praise in endless day andI don't care to stay here long.Right up Yonder! Christians, away up Yon-der.  Oh, yes my Lord, for I don't care to stay here long
I can't say with the wordsmust listen!
I can't even begin to say how much I love these albums (i just picked UYI 1 to write my review for both).  Everyone always says that Appetite is Guns best album...no way in hell.  The Illusion albums are so much richer.  Now don't get me wrong, I love appetite but it is more of a party album with cool guitar work and catchy tunes.  The illusion twins are just so much deeper lyrically and have many more styles woven in and out of a hard rock framework.  I can identify with so many of axls lyrics, and the music just makes them stand out so much more.  Slash is basically the best hard rock guitar player ever, and he has more awesome solos and leads on these albums than most guitar players have in a career.  And the best part about these albums is that the lesser known songs are usually the best, such as: Locomotive, Bad Apples, Dont Damn Me, The Garden, Pretty Tied Up, Coma, Civil War, Get in the Ring, Breakdown, Estranged (kind of popular but still fairly unknown) 14 Years, Bad Obscession, Dust n Bones, Dead Horse, and more.  Then of course there are the hits, Dont Cry, November Rain, Knockin on Heavens Door, Live and Let Die, You Could Be Mine etc.  The only songs i dont really like that much are My World (wtf?) and shotgun blues, but everything else is just so gdamn good.  Do yourself a favor and go buy these albums if u consider yourself a hard rock fan.  The illusion albums are art, plain and simple
We started playing this for our one year old when we were driving on a short trip out of town. As babies sometimes do, she began screaming and was unconsolable... UNTIL we turned on Rocket Ship Beach. Polly wolly doodle calmed her right down and continues to do so. We played that song at least 6 times in a row that day! now that she's a little older, she points to the cd player in the car if something else is playing, requesting her cd be played. I've always enjoyed a wide range of music, and was afraid that after having a child, we'd be reduced to listening to watered down "kid music" like that purple dinosaur and those australian guys. There is a mixture of classics reimagined and new songs that i find myself humming all of the time. There is a good variety of instrumentation and styles. Our daughter claps at the end of her favorites and often waves her arms about. Got kids? Buy this cd!
...else if Michigan was on vinyl I would have worn it out by now.Illinois was my first venture into the sound-world of Sufjan Stevens, and no doubt it his most impressive outing to date. However the subtle spendour of the earlier Michigan has ousted it as my favourite. Perhaps less eclectic and entertaining than Illinois, but more soulful and beautiful. Ultimately it's the one I'd take to the proverbial Desert Island.There's not a single track in this 74 minute CD that I'd want to skip or drop from my MP3 playlist, but highlights for me are Romulus (gentle and heartbreaking), Sleeping Bear (musically gorgeous), and Vito's Ordination Song (like being gently hugged).p.s. So often the 'bonus tracks' on a CD can seem superfluous and substandard but the 2 extras on my CD (Marching Band and Pickerel Lake) are both excellent.
His singing style is very unique as are his lyrics.  He has an eclectic mix of love songs, "we are the world" type songs and a few others on this album.  He has the staying power for long the long term and I would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes.  I loved Streetcorner Symphony!  It is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me.  Lonely No More is my theme song for right now in my life - needless to say I am replaying grooves in that one!  Enjoy this album - I sure do
Like many Amazon reviewers, I play a teensy bit of guitar.  I know just enough to know how incredible these guys are.  This is the best, most exciting acoustic playing I've heard since Al DiMeola cut "Race With Devil on Spanish Highway" on his Elegant Gypsy Suite LP.  Watching the Del Castillo brothers shred on the DVD part of this set will assure that I don't get anywhere near my guitar for a long time.  Since Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Spy Kids, etc) filmed the performances, we get appallingly good, tight shots of the fretwork.  People, it can't be done.  I will henceforth concentrate on harmonica, and try to forget that Sugar Blue does about the same level of impossibility on that instrument.The songs and playing come from a somewhat traditional Latin, Mexicano perspective, but the overall sound is more like Santana when Carlos goes acoustic.  The "hidden track" on the CD most overtly shows that the Del Castillo brothers love their blues and rock almost as much as the Latin roots music.This is an obvious buy for anyone who enjoys Latin music or great guitar work of any style, but it is more accurate to say that anyone who is not totally averse to this style should check it out.  The quality of music here really transcends the genre
This was one of my first albums I got. I got it because of 'Paradise City' but got adapted quickly to 'Welcome to the Jungle' and rest. There were only few more metal/rock albums that made such impact on my taste during teens: Maiden's 'Powerslave',  Megadeth 'Rust in Peace'  and Suicidal Tendencies 'Lights...Camera...revolution' 
Without getting too much into it this Album is pretty good. 4 stars for some bad ass tracks. My favs are Tears from the moon, Beautiful things , As the rush comes. All in all worth the money
I, like many others, have been waiting for this album for quite some time.  Right from the first track, I was hooked.  "All My Days" is a haunting, melodic, heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album.  "Breathe" has a subdued yet powerful message.  "Home" is just plain fun.  "Song For You" is sweet, somber, and hopeful.However, I must say that the Four Songs version of "Orange Sky" is what I consider to be the greatest song ever written.  However, the Time Without Consequence version is devastatingly bad (when held up to the light of the original).  The new version is too fast, has an inexplicably irritating percussion, and just doesn't dig into the soul the way the Four Songs version does.  I will always be baffled by this remake.  It is truly awful.  Its only saving grace is that the original is still available.But that is by no means any reason to avoid this CD.  In fact, those who do not know the original "Orange Sky" may fall in love with this one.  But it is my duty to warn those looking for an "Orange Sky" that matches the original that you will be severely disappointed.  Outside of this single-song complaint, this CD has vaulted to one of the best I own
EDITED:It took me a while to enjoy listening to this whole album since I am used to listening to her recent work - Afterglow  Surfacing.  This is truly an outstanding album and definitely overlooked. In my opinion, this ranks as the 3rd best Sarah McLachlan album with #1 Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and #2 Afterglow -- even though Surfacing outsold these 2 albums.I can't say much about the album, because some of the reviews here say what I would say for this album as well.Drawn to the Rhythm: 5/5Into The Fire: 5/5The Path of Thorns (Terms): 5/5 - first song from Solace I heard. Truly unique than the rest since she sings at a lower range.I Will Not Forget You: 5+/5 - LOVE IT, My #1 favorite of all her songs on this album.Lost: 4.5/5 (this is a first for Sarah McLachlan to have male background singers singing - Edited:  actually this would be the third as her 1st album "Touch" had male bg singers for the tracks Trust and Strange World)Back Door Man: 5/5 - I truly enjoy this song, this song sort of reminds me of Stupid from Afterglow. I love her intense voice and wish she could do more songs like this.Shelter: 5/5 - really sad and it's actually the second Solace song I heard after 'Path'Black: 5+/5 - this is my second favorite song.  All in all, deep lyrics dedicated to corporate pigs as Sarah says.  One of her first experimental songs after "Touch".Home: 5/5 - this is also another good song, probably the 3rd I love.  I just love how the song ends.  It actually sounds better live since the instruments overlap her singing.Mercy: 5/5 - I consider this the last song from the album. WYLLH doesn't do it for me and I'm disappointed Sarah let Arista have it their way.  Oh well.  Sarah should do more acapella-like songs!  This truly displayed her skills and got even better in the next album ;)Overall rating: 9.5/10Outstanding album I wish it had more praise
 This album came out about 8 years before I was born. All the years, I still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play WBSS or Billie Jean. Now I know all the lyrics and music videos from this album. This is MJ in his prime. Unfortunately, we will never get another epic like this again. Michael is sadly a target in the media, but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not. Every song off here is a classic. One song I thought was unneccesary was "Baby Be Mine". But otherwise, it's excellent. If you starting an MJ collection, get this album first. Trust me.
Hiphop as a genre is so wide spread and international that sometimes we get wonderful creative jems like Lady Sovereign. She is not only lyrically impressive, but the mixes of electronics on all her tracks will get you moving, which is basically what she sets out to do. I dont know much about the hip hop insprised grime scene in the UK, but i will definitely be keeping on eye out now. And i will patiently await for S.O.V. debut US album.Favorite Track, though all of it is really good, will have to be "The Battle" feature other grime scene artists like Shystie, Zuz Rock, and Frost P spitting the wildest (barely understandable lol) rhymes ive heard. No men and women have battled against each other like this, especially for the listening public.How ever, no one should compare SOV to anyone (Missy or M.I.A.) All emcees, particularly female one have a different style and should be prasied for such. SOV has a style totally different from anything ive heard to date. It's refreashing to see a new spin on HipHop.
Yes, there may be some small issues with the sound quality, but you get used to it, and Wilhelm Kempff is definitely one of the great pianists of the 20th Century, so it is worth it. These are incredible performances that are often justly called definitive. Kempff seems to always bring out every theme of every work and magnifies its emotional intensity, whereas other pianists would not have nearly as much attention to detail and neglect many subtle themes. Highly recommended
Kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth. The Dreaming was underrated when it was first released, but I think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time. This is a superb album, tracks like Sat in Your Lap, Suspended in Gaffa, Leave It Open, Night of The Swallow, Houdini, and Get Out of My House proving this point. There's lots of anger on this album, as Kate put it herself many years ago, and it is her "darkest" effort to date, but it's pure brilliance! Buy it and be convinced.....
La Bamba (1987.) The soundtrack to the Ritchie Valens biopic of the same name.INTRODUCTION:In 1987, the film La Bamba, based on the life and times of fifties pop-rock star Ritchie Valens, was released. The film cast Lou Diamond Phillips as the classic musician, and told his story, from his rise to fame, right down to his young and tragic death. For the film, Los Lobos, a fairly popular act of the day, was asked to rerecord classic Valens material for the movie. Some other moderately popular musicians who portrayed other musicians of the same era depicted in the film also provided recordings for the film. So, how is the soundtrack? Read on, and find out!OVERVIEW:The La Bamba soundtrack was released in 1987, around the same time as the film of the same name. Contributors to the soundtrack include Los Lobos, Howard Huntsberry, Marshall Crenshaw, Brian Setzer, and Bo Diddley. The A-Side of the soundtrack sonsists of the Los Lobos covers of the Ritchie Valens songs La Bamba, Come On Lets Go, Ooh My Head, We Belong Together, Framed, and Donna. The B-Side consists of the other artists' covers, which include Howard Huntsberry's cover of Jackie Wilson's Lonely Teardrops, Marshall Crenshaw's cover of Buddy Holly's Crying Waiting Hoping, Brian Setzer's cover of Eddie Cochran's Summertime Blues, Bo Diddley's remake of his own classic tune Who Do You Love, and the two songs Los Lobos recorded for the film which were not remakes, Charlena and Goodnight My Love.REVIEW:Awesome movie, awesome soundtrack. I'm a huge fan of the music of Ritchie Valens, and for the most part, La Bamba proved to be an efficient and entertaining retelling of the Valens saga. Aside from some omitted material (which I'll get to later), the soundtrack is every bit as good as the film it represents. Read on for my reviews of the tracks.-SIDE A--La Bamba by Los Lobos: Los Lobos covers the track that took Ritchie Valens to the top of the musical world. Being a folk song, no one ever thought a rock and roll version would do well - Valens proved the non-believers wrong! Los Lobos does a great cover of it, too. The band actually did two versions of the song for the movie - a rendition of the slower, folksier version by the bar band that convinced Valens to cover the song himself, as well as the classic version Valens did. This is the classic Valens version. I wish they had included both versions of the soundtrack, though (although an instrumental sequence near the end of this version DOES reprise elements of the folk-type version. Still, I wanted BOTH versions as complete, separate tracks!)-Come On Lets Go by Los Lobos: This classic rockabilly-style cut was another huge hit for Ritchie Valens. Los Lobos creates a fine rendition of the classic cut, staying true to the Valens original while at the same time adding their own spin onto things. All in all, another great song.-Ooh My Head by Los Lobos: Not much to say about this one. Once again, Los Lobos manages to create an excellent version of one of the many classic Valens tunes people know and love him for. Every song on this soundtrack is excellent, and this one is no exception.-We Belong Together by Los Lobos: Ah, the classic Valens love song. Although its success was pretty much ousted by the better known ballad Donna, this one was still a fairly notable hit for Valens. The Los Lobos take on the ballad is a damn good one - but I shouldn't have to tell you that, now should I?-Framed by Los Lobos: Of all of the Ritchie Valens song that Los Lobos revisited in La Bamba, this one is the least well known. That's a shame, because it's a great song! The song takes a classic blues styling, and puts a rockabilly spin on it. Once again, Los Lobos does a marvelous cover version of the song.-Donna by Los Lobos: This song was so big a hit for Ritchie Valens initially, that his only song even on the same plane of popularity is La Bamba. The classic ode Valens wrote to his high school girlfriend proved to be the stuff that has withstood the test of time. And I know you're probably getting tired of me saying this for every song, but Los Lobos really does a good job on here.-SIDE B--Lonely Teardrops by Howard Huntsberry: In La Bamba, Howard Huntsberry portrayed the classic soul singer Jackie Wilson. And here, Huntsberry reprises Wilson's signature tune. This is classic soul at its very best. Prior to seeing La Bamba, I had never even heard of Huntsberry. But the real shocker is that I ended up liking this version of the song more than the original! Definitely a solid, underrated cut.-Crying Waiting Hoping by Marshall Crenshaw: Marshall Crenshaw, a fairly popular eighties pop signer, managed to land the role of Buddy Holly in La Bamba. Holly, of course, was killed in the same plane crash that claimed the life of Ritchie Valens. Buddy Holly is a tough guy to cover, but Marshall Crenshaw does a damn good job of it. I personally prefer this version over Holly's original (and that's saying a lot since I LOVE Buddy Holly!) If you're interested in hearing Crenshaw cover another Holly tune, check out the remastered version of his 1982 self-titled debut - he covers Rave On on there as a bonus track.-Summertime Blues by Brian Setzer: Long before Brian Setzer gained any real fame, he played Eddie Cochran in La Bamba, covering the song that made that man a rockabilly legend. Here's another one of those covers that is so good, I like it more than the original. Definitely worthwhile listening - but then again, isn't every song on here?-Who Do You Love by Bo Diddley: Bo Diddley himself did this song originally so very long ago, and was asked to rerecord it for La Bamba. He did, and the end results are solid. Diddley is a legend of the blues, and this recording is just a small sample of why so many people feel that way. It just a shame that the version of this song most people remember is the George Thorogood one, because Diddley's version is the song the way it was meant to be heard. -Charlena by Los Lobos: In addition to the Ritchie Valens covers, Los Lobos recorded two new songs for the La Bamba soundtrack. This is the first of the two. Essentially, this here is a neo-rockabilly track of sorts, and a damn good one too. Long after the fifties music scene died out, Los Lobos still managed to record a song that suited the style perfectly.-Goodnight My Love by Los Lobos: Here's the second of the newly-recorded Los Lobos songs done for the soundtrack. What we have here is one of those classic fifties-style rock ballads that were so popular back then. If you're into that sort of thing, you're going to love this song - I know I do!-OTHER COMMENTS-Omissions are the biggest problem with this soundtrack, by far. As I previously stated, only one version of La Bamba is on here - not both versions from the film. Another omission is Sleepwalk, the classic Santo And Johnny instrumental that shows up frequently in the film. Its omission is likely due to the fact that it wasn't recorded just for the film, but still, I miss it. And then there's the issue of Rip It Up, the classic Ritchie Valens rockabilly tune he first plays with his band in their garage, early on in the film. This was one of my favorite songs in the film, and I was devastated not to see it on here. And where's the Big Bopper's Chantilly Lace? I rated this soundtrack four stars instead of five because of omissions. If these songs had been on here, it would be five stars all the way.OVERALL:Overall, despite my issues with the omitted songs, I am very satisfied with the La Bamba soundtrack. Much like the movie, it's an excellent experience all the way through. If you liked the movie, or you're just into this sort of music, the soundtrack is well worth owning. Highly recommended!EDITION NOTES:This soundtrack is becoming increasingly more difficult to find on compact disc, implying it may be very gradually going out of print. Take my advice - if you want it, just buy it online. It's the fastest, easiest way to get it.
When I first heard this album I was a bit shocked.  Myself and my fellow TMBG fans derided it as a "teen angst album," moaned and whined that John  John had betrayed us by adding a band, and generally refused to give it a chance.A few years later, listening to my entire collection of TMBG in chonological order (a sanity-restoration ritual), I realized that this album is AWESOME!There are only 2 stupid songs, Window and DirtBike.  Hey, for TMBG, that's not bad - their fans forgive them stupidity on a regular basis.  Aside from that, there are more rockin', thought-provoking tunes here than you'll find almost anywhere.  This album establishes beyond a doubt that TMBG are among the most gifted songwriters in rock history.I'm not going to go over each individual song - there are millions of TMBG fans who have and will.  I will add my 2 cents about my 4 favorites however:"I Should be Allowed to Think" - TMBG does justice to beat poetry, and beyond!"Why Must I Be Sad?" - Funny and pissy, great for getting those pesky emotions unstuck.  The lyrics are genius, subtly quoting the best of Alice Cooper with tongue firmly planted in cheek."A Self Called Nowhere" - Righteous, angry, and breathtaking.   Angsty punk bands of the world, take note: you will NEVER be this hardcore."The End of the Tour" - I have written in my last wishes that I want this one played at my funeral.  One of the most moving and emotionally honest rock ballads ever written.If your idea of TMBG is songs like "Istanbul" and "Particle Man," get over it!  And give this album a chance! 
So many times, older recordings are not very high quality but not with this group of songs. If you are a Marty Robbins fan (and I am) this CD is a must
ALL I CAN SAY IS YOU MUST TRY THIS!
I am a big Ambrosia fan and I love "Biggest Part of Me", "You're the Only Woman", "How Much I Feel" and the newer track "I Just Can't Let Go".  However, I wish this CD contained all of their Billboard Hot 100 hits.  The CD is missing their cover of "Magical Mystery Tour" (#39) and "How Can You Love Me" (#86).  For the casual listener, this CD is perfect.  For the chart hit completionists out there, it misses a couple songs.  I bought this CD used for $1.99, which was a HUGE bargain for the songs included.  For that price, I can certainly try to download the missing tracks
i just want to say that this record blows my mind!  Only the japanese could come up with this musical hybrid that defies definition.  Only miss minekawa could inject such beautiful innocence into this thrilling aural rollercoaster of breaks, samples, and guitars.  Cornelius and DJ Me DJ You  are brilliant
I'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews, this CD is amazing. It's not anything like Soundgarden or Audioslave - but it's amazing none-the-less. Every song on here is beautifully written, and, as always, Cornell's voice doesn't disappoint. It's different, but one of my new favorite CDs
When my boyfriend bought this for me I was so happy and I remember I would play this music and sing for him in the car on cool dark, starry nights and I would be mesmerized not only by the intensity of those nights, but by the music she sang and how she deeply, richly portrayed those songs. She really knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well. I totally recommend this CD to start if you have not heard much of her music...SHe truly is addicting once you hear these songs...These songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and romantic journey
If you are expecting "Safari Moon Pt. 2", you will be dissapointed. Air took a more adventuourous, darker, ambient, serious, experimental, and ultimtately brilliant journey into electronic music. The songs here range from sounding like Aphex Twin (without the weird off-putting effects or heavy drums) to Thievery Corp. Air still has a beautiful sense of melody and as usual the tunes themselves are beautifully and creatively put together (even a throwaway Air song is a well-crafted one). Overall, all us true hardcore Air fans love this album. Those who only loved MS may not like it, but that's their loss I say
If you do not yet own Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here AND The Wall, do not even consider purchasing A Momentary Lapse of Reason. AMLOR is junk by comparison.That said, very few rock albums ever made can hang with those three, and AMLOR certainly has its bright spots. "Learning to Fly" and "On the Turning Away" are as good as anything Pink Floyd has ever produced. Some of the other songs are adequate, but this album does not contain the front-to-back brillance of the earlier Floyd releases. It's definitely worth having, but make sure that you have the others first.
This album is the foudation of modern Hip Hop...the format of the album the presence of Rakim ....his image everything was new territory when this album came out in 86' all Hip Hop lovers should have this album especially people down south
Considering how much bad music is out there these days, this was nice to come across.  Covers a wide range of topics and moods, musicianship is pretty good.  I'd recommend it to just about anyone.  My tastes are usually heavier and more progressive - Rush, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Queensryche.  But I like this disc too
It's impossible to like all of country music, but Randy Travis is liked by even those who don't like country music. From 1986 and through the 90's he was always on top or near the top of the country charts.  His calm, nasal drawl reminds me a bit of Lefty Frizell, but there's no mistaking his unique style. These are some of the best recordings in the history of country music including Digging Up Bones, Forever and Ever, Amen, Too Gone Too Long, Is It Still Over?, Hard Rock Bottom Of Your Heart etc. Randy had 16 No. 1's on the country charts. There are 20 cuts here.  If you only want one CD with all his greatest hits this is your logical choice. By the way, the sound from Rhino is bright and punchy and the booklet features dates, neat pixs, and peak positions. You've got a winner for life with this one!  
Good singing and Good Production must I say anything else?.....No get this if you love mixtures of good uptempo and slow Rn
This is mood making, sexy, great music. Neal adds a slight rock edge to some beautiful and familiar melodies. This album is great for background music (we play it in our store), party music or just for listing. One of the best guitar players of all time 'sings' with his instrument. BUY IT NOW
I personally like this compilation of Prince, it's got most of the songs I like and the sound is great. Sure, there could have been a few more songs included, like "Pop Life", "Hot Thing", but when compared to the other compilations, this disc has more of the songs that are a must-have, for me, such as "I Wanna Be Your Lover", which I don't think was included on any of the other compilations. So, it's just a matter of weighing what songs you most want, so that's why I chose this disc and I'm glad I did! 
I owned the album as a kid.......I enjoy it as much now as I did then
For the longest time, I have thought that observational truths were highly prone to being the most piercing of things: I have believed that the truth could either hurt (or disturb) you terribly, or make you laugh so hard, to the point of hysteria--or a combination of both extremes. There are many things to put this theory to the test, but to cut it all short, all one would need to do (if by chance it hasn't been done already) is experience the observational humor of Richard Pryor to possibly get a better understanding of what I am talking about. This classic comedy album from 1975 is a prime example.Richard Pryor has been hailed as a genius by many, and I would have to agree: it takes plenty of intelligence and natural talent to be a comedian for starters, but to also turn many disturbing observational truths of everyday life into something painfully, body-breakingly hilarious takes a whole lot of something as well. From the very beginning, to the tail-end of this CD, 1975's _Is It Something I Said?_ is a non-stop laugh fest, that personally gets *me* laughing so loud and hard, I end up pretty much abusing almost every part of my body in the process: my throat, my lungs, my sides, my stomach--they all end up feeling beaten and worn-out. Richard's takes on drugs, sex, race  racism, relationships, and politics in general are every bit as painfully observational as they are profane--and did I mention HILARIOUS? The racy quality of the material found here makes so much of what's referred to as "cutting-edge" these days, seem so contrived and unaffecting; Richard's observations seem just as relevant now--if not more so--as they were 30 years ago. I couldn't be graphic in pointing out some of the sickeningly funny moments on this disc -- and there are MANY -- but I should say that the opening one-two punch of "Eulogy," and "Shortage of White People," and Richard's take on his own battle with cocaine addiction in the "Cocaine" bit get me cracking up SO hysterically, I sometimes need to be careful not to make myself sick. And again, those are just a few of the MANY hysterical blasts found here.Richard Pryor is considered a comedic legend for a reason. This album here is a good example as to why he is considered as such. Just don't play it for the kids, and for the love of god *don't* play it during the middle of the night; you most certainly will disturb the beauty rest of your family, and your neighbors. And you know what could happen if you disturb one person's beauty rest: just imagine what would happen if you disturbed the beauty rest of many..
I think this my first EP purchase ever - and I generally feel that, despite the quality many offer, EPs just are not worth it. Sam Beam was clearly on a mission to change my mind, as these apparent "outtakes" from The Creek Drank The Cradle are every bit as good as that miracle debut - if not better. I only very recently discovered Iron and Wine through Our Endless Numbered Days, and have since been backtracking only to see that this remarkably talented artist can do no wrong. The standout track to me is The Night Descending, it has the feel of a track pulled right out of the past. The other four tracks are just as excellent though, and I think Sam's managed to make an avid fan out of me. Damn... and just when I thought there were no new artists to be excited about!
"Horizon" was a turning point in the recording career of the Carpenters--a more sophisticated sound more suited to Karen's rich and warm voice. But the album was rather short, and some of the songs just weren't up to the standards expected by their fans, which was reflected in the sales of the album, which was their slowest selling album up to that point.The opening "Aurora" and the closing "Eventide" (The same melody with different lyrics) nicely bookend the album, and Aurora provides the first hint that this was not the average Carpenters album. "Only Yesterday" follows; this beautiful and uptempo song begins as a dolorous, downbeat ballad before segueing into the cheerful refrain. The cover of "Desperado" is well done, but ultimately it is lost between the flashy tracks before and after it. "Please Mr. Postman" is infectuously happy fluff; it has absolutely no depth, but is irresistable while it's playing and will have you singing along with Karen.  The big-band era "I Can Dream, Can't I?" reveals the new depths of Karen's voice, and the small jazz combo  ensures that she is the focus of the listener. The third and final single from this album, "Solitaire" begins the second half of the album on a (metaphorical) high note. The remaining full tracks ("Happy","I'm Caught Between Goodbye and I Love You", and "Love Me for What I Am") are all less-than-captivating songs that greatly benefit from Karen's reading and Richard's arrangements
I received "Aerial" last December, and it still amazes me.  The music soars and sweeps, carrying the listener along on its wings.  It is a work of genius, and those who are long-time Kate Bush fans will find that it was well worth waiting twelve years for this masterpiece to arrive!  This two-disc set offers the listener two different experiences, in my opinion.  The first disc, "A Sea of Honey" is comprised of sort of stand alone pieces, first of which is "King of the Mountain," probably the most "commercially appealing" song on the album.  "King of the Mountain" sucks the listener in with deep, murky tones and Kate's voice easing into the song softly, building in intensity as the song progresses.  "King of the Mountain" is followed by songs like "Pi" (who else but Kate Bush could make the derivation of Pi sound so sexy?) and "Bertie," a lovely Elizabethan paean to her young son.  Then there are emotionally raw songs like "Mrs. Bartolozzi" and "A Coral Room," the latter of which is about Kate's late Mother.  The reclusive Ms. Bush teases the listener about the struggle for anonymity in "How to Be Invisible," and sings in reference to Joan of Arc in "Joanni."After being captivated by songs about famous people, and more down-to-earth personal struggles/triumphs, the listener comes to the second disc, titled "A Sky of Honey."  This is, in my opinion, the pi�ce de r�sistance of "Aerial."  This disc is a continuous journey of sound, taking the listener on an amazing voyage punctuated by--among other things--the sounds of birds, the sound of her child's voice, and Kate Bush's silky voice singing in Italian.  The disc is almost indescribably beautiful, in my opinion.  I love the way "A Sky of Honey" takes me out of myself when I hear it.  I feel like I am flying at points; becoming one with the soaring birds.  My personal favorite on "A Sky of Honey" is "Nocturn," a surreal nighttime romp on the beach, accompanied by thumping bass and showcasing the pure magic of Kate Bush's voice.  The disc's final (and title) track "Aerial" is a forceful climax to the sonic journey, and ends with Bush singing:"I want to be up on the roofI've gotta be up on the roofUp, up high on the roofUp, up on the roofIn the sun"It is as though Kate Bush has reached new heights and has taken the listener along for the trip.  What an absolutely magnificent acheievement this disc is!To Kate Bush fans, I cannot recommend this album highly enough.  True, it was a very long wait for this new CD, but, Ms. Bush has rewarded her fans duly; indeed it is almost like she released two separate albums at once with this two-disc triumph!  If you are a Kate Bush devotee, you will not be disappointed!  And, if you are new to Kate Bush, "Aerial" will be a great introduction to her genius.  Kate Bush is like no other artist I can name.  Her voice is incredibly versatile; she can mold it to sound like an angel or a banshee, a temptress or a child.  And, so far in her career, it Kate Bush's voice gets better with the passing of time.  Like a fine wine, one can savor it and contemplate its complexities endlessly.  "Aerial" is well, well worth listening to, and words alone cannot suffice to explain what a work of art it is.  
First, I'd like to say that I am so glad there are artists like Amel around who aren't trying to fit in with today's commercial R scene. As a long time fan of R and soul music I can't help but feel sad and dissapointed at the direction the genre is taking, especially in regards to female singers. She may be beautiful, but she doesn't need to use her looks to overcompensate for any lack of vocal talent by flaunting herself. Amel has a beautiful soul, and you can hear that through her wonderful voice and lyrics. Every song on this album has at some point or another touched me, some songs straight away while others grew on me slowly. You know how sometimes when you're listening to music and a particular lyric or vocal piece makes you shiver? Amel's got that down for me.I was firstly introduced to nusoul by Teedra Moses, someone who I've admired for two years now, and who to me seemed one of the few decent R singers left. Through Teedra I stumbled on Amel's "Bravebird" and became more and more curious as I listened to the album over and over. Like with most nu/soul, the love I have for each song grew slowly, and songs I thought weren't for me suddenly became my favorites on the album. I love that about Amel; she makes me suprise myself, as I become emotionally involved with her music and voice over time until I'm enchanted."For Real" hit me instantly as a beautiful song. I never get tired of it's cute opening where Amel's daughter babbles something in baby talk!I'd love to talk about each song individually, but I'd probably just bore you. To me Amel's music is a personal experience, and most likely strikes people in different ways. I will mention however, "Congo" - one of the songs on there I was tempted to skip at first but has fast become something of an obsession which crops into my head throughout the days, with it's monotonous jungle vibe. Other personal favorites include "We Can Be New", "Say You Want It", "All I Got2"... Hell the whole album really.Along with other outstanding artists of the nu-soul genre, Amel has succesfully metamorphosised my taste in back music. Trust me, you'll never go back to commercial R again
Overdrive, watching the rain, Enchanted, Teaching myself to dream, Glow, Lemon, Because I can are really excellent songs, this album is really worth it.
This is where AFI began their sound change from their first 2 cd's (answer that  stay fashionable, Very Proud of Ya). It is much more serious than the first 2, alot angrier, heavier, Darker, and more screaming/yelling as well. Some people say this is their best, I disagree, I prefer their "punkier" 1st 2 BUT i still enjoy this alot, it's all down to personal taste, it gets a 5/5 for me
I have just about all of Robben's albums and I believe that this is his best work. The interpretations and musicianship are outstanding. Robben's improvisational playing actually comes across more like  composition. His  technique is extremely melodic. He is, in my opinion, one the best blues  guitar players around and his profound knowledge of jazz gives his music a  very refreshing twist. Check out his prowess on You cut  me to the bone, Prison of love or My love will  never die
Although I like this album, there's nothing that especially stands out about it. It's typical Bright Eyes, and if you already love the band you won't be disappointed. However, it's not one of their best albums. It's not as good as Lifted, not as addicting as Fevers and Mirrors, and not as raw and endearing as Letting off the Happiness. But yet again, Conor succeeds in writing songs that capture all of the emotion without making me ill in a Dashboard Confessional sort of way
I first encountered Bird3 opening for Veruca Salt the summer of 2001.  That band had put their faith into Bird and so have I.  We fell in love with them all together.  This band has successfully combined infectious pop hooks with soul-baring lyrics to create something unique, beautiful, and far from most of the trite pop or rock music you hear on the radio today.  You'll find yourself not only humming along, but holding this music close to your heart at your most intimate moments.  You will not once regret buying this piece of art
Earlier, I had an LP called "Best of the Band" that was 10 cuts and maybe 35 minutes. This is 18 well chosen cuts and double the length. There are a lot of "best of/greatest hits" type collections from veteran artists that originally came out in 70's or early 80's that had a limited number of songs and length. This IS a case where the record decided to offer more songs and give the customer a better value for their money. The music itself is 5 stars and they were a major artist due to the fact that they had 3 very good but very different lead vocalists handling the vocals. It gives the music a lot more variety and they put out a lot of fine music in their 1968-76 prime. As an aside, 3 of the Band members (Helm, Danko, and Hudson) also put out some good music in the 1990's
This album is great but I'm looking for a song that I think they sung. It goes: Pressing on we're pressing on (repeat). Waiting on Jesus to answer our call we're holding on (repeat) Pressing, pressing, pressing. If anyone knows the name of the song, or has any suggestions on who sings this song, please email me at udeebear1984@yahoo.com. Thank you and have a blessed day! :
Hot Hot Heat is one of the few new bands to pique my interest. Their first release was decent, but "Elevator" is even better. Great tunes, drums and guitars - and, of course, Steve Bays' yelping vocals. There's only three songs I really don't care for - "Pickin' It Up", "Soldier In A Box" and "Shame On You". Looking forward to the next CD
I used to be a bigger fan of Joe Satriani than Steve Vai about 10 years ago.  Now I quickly get bored of new Satriani albums, but Vai's music just moves me.  Lotus feet for example, wow, words cannot describe what that song does to me. Thanks Steve
I'm a fan of Three 6 Mafia, and I can say maybe they kinda got a little of Three 6's rap style in this album, but I dunno.DJ Paul and Juicy J, the superproducers, they can never be beaten. I got all the Hypnotize Minds albums and they did invent crunk music. Many people haven't heard of them cuz besides Ridin' Spinners and Chickenhead they haven't been played on the radio very much except for their new track "Poppin' My Collar."Crime Mob's alright. The beats are alright, but nothing compared to Three 6 Mafia. Some of them are some krunk songs, I can get hyped to a few of them. But other than that I dunno. The lyrics are rather simple, I'm an 18 year old white dude and I think I can put together some better bars than these dudes can.But they do get some major play up here in Virginia. Stilletos and Knuck if you Buck haven't gotten some airtime. But there's only like 4 songs total that are worth hearing. I guess we'll see if they put out another album or not. I think if they had some other fellas from Georgia like T.I. or Jeezy or something they might get some more hype. Who knows, since Paul Wall's on every song now maybe he'll make a cameo. I guess we'll see.Three 6 Mafia still the buckest and besides their new artist Chrome, who really is garbage, they are still the kings of crunk, not Lil' John
if you do not own this album you must get your hand on a copy. It is the best debut album since definatly mayby. Tracks like golden touch V.I.C.E well lets just say every song on the album is a bonnifide hit including the bangingstumbble and fall which will have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds. If you like the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd this is a must have
One of his best times. All the songs on this CD are great he express his fellings very openly. With this CD people can really see who Marc Anthony really is
The earlier reviews pretty much said it all; this is pretty much one of THE best and most overlooked bands from the 90s.  Swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer category often, however, if that label scares you off then dismiss its application to this band, because they aren't so much shoegazer - in that cough-syrup-dreamy-noise way - as they are sonic rock.  Yes, rock.  Who knew it could still be done, and believe me, they do it well, and uniquely.  If you've listened to Swervedriver before, then tehre isn't too much more to say - buy this album.  It's not as hi-fi as 99th Dream or Mezcal Head (in my opinion their best album and one of the best of 90s decade), but not as fast or dirty as Raise.  Now, if you have never listened to Swervedriver, this might not be the best album to start with - it all depends on your tastes.  Personally, I would suggest starting with 99th Dream or Mezcal Head; either way, this has all the qualities of every Swervedriver album - great lyrics, superb and unique songs, and that urge for more when it's over.  Sadly, this band was vastly ill-treated by labels and they are no longer together (however, some vestiges exist in the form of Toshack Highway).  But if you want to see what you missed in the 90s - even more so, if you want to see what the best of the best from that decade truly was - Swervedriver is a must
Every thing he sings is perfect, I've yet to find one song that doesn't move me.  This CD has some beauties.  Daughter of Mine is priceless.  Steal Away is very nice.  One Small  Star brings tears.  This arrangement of Voyage is  probably the best I've heard.  His traditional songs (When you and I  were young Maggie and Mary of Argyle) are beautiful.  I  can't find anything on this CD I couldn't listen to for hours.  I truly  love music and listen to it constantly.  I find myself reaching for the  McDermott CD's almost exclusively.  I have them all, more please
Kudos to Harvey Fierstein for being so true to the Jean Poiret play. Jerry Herman did a wonderful score - my favorite song was "The Best of Times". Gene Barry turns out to be a good singer, esp paired with the talented George Hearn
I'm only giving this 5 stars because the actual recordings are priceless. However I'm telling you now. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUMThis is stolen goods and the recordings that are on this cd are not even of the finest quality.This is purely a commercial album released by the record company without the permission of Jack Off Jill's members. And thus they recieve no royalties for the selling of this album.Fear not though. you can get the tracks off this album completely free and in better quality. Agent Moulder of Jack Off Jill has remastered and released them on her website for your downloading pleasure. you can find them here:t-c-r.net/jojmusic while you are there check out and support her new band TCR, and their new album 'The Chrome Recordings'.Singer Jessicka also has an amazing new band if you didn't already know. check her and Scarling. out at scarling.com God Bless Jack Off Jill. 
Hey!....It's Johnny Cash! You can't go wrong purchasing anything by Johnny Cash. 
This CD offers a great deal of incredible music by John Lennon during 1969 and the early 1970's when he fought our government in order for him and Yoko to live in the United States. The quality of the music is excellent and after you listen to this CD you want to run to watch the film!The CD starts off strong with "Power To The People." The song makes its political statement and offers a great beat that sticks in your mind. It is also very upbeat and aggressive in its tone which attracts the listener immediately to make them want more. The listener won't be disappointed. The tracks that follow provide great insight into John's politics at the same time that he provides us with his singularly beautiful music. Great songs on this CD include the autobiographical "Nobody Told Me" in which John admits that his struggle with our government both to end the Vietnam War and to remain in the USA is harder than he thought it would be. "Working Class Hero" has a folksy, bluesy feel to it but then the CD goes right back to that unique John Lennon rock and roll flavor with the song "I Found Out." "Bed Peace" follows as a type of introduction to the only Beatles song on this CD, "The Ballad Of John  Yoko." Despite the catchy rock and roll beat to "The Ballad Of John  Yoko," the lyrics tell the sad story of how people harass John and Yoko. Another great song is "Give Peace A Chance;" the message here is obvious. "Love," "Imagine," and "Oh My Love" are beautiful ballads with excellent musical arrangements; and we get a new instrumental version of "How Do You Sleep" that is very well done. In addition, I like the two live tracks from the John Sinclair Freedom Rally in 1971. "Attica State" is a brand new release and "John Sinclair" packs a strong punch! These tracks demonstrate so well John's ability to connect with his audience in a live setting.One special song on this CD directly challenges each and every listener to personal reflection and insight: "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)." John and Yoko tell people to know the difference between the blessings of peace and the evils of war, to cherish what is morally right and to fight against anything that is morally wrong. The song also expresses hope for a peaceful future beyond the current Christmas season. "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" continues to play on radio stations every Christmas season to this day.Yes, another Amazon reviewer correctly notes that Yoko talks a little bit over the very beginning of the song "Oh My Love." Thank goodness that she doesn't talk over the lyrics! A few brief dialogue excerpts from the film are peppered throughout the CD but they never overlap with the songs.The CD ends with the same strength that it started with: "Instant Karma! (We All Shine On)" is an excellent song that most Lennon fans will always love.The liner notes include some great black and white pictures of John and Yoko, including two from the infamous "bed-in." You get the song credits along with the year that each song was released and there is a brief essay by Yoko Ono herself. Overall, this CD is more than just a retrospective of John's music during a turbulent period in his life. Oh sure, almost all of this music has been previously released. However, that's not relevant here. The CD celebrates Lennon's ability to communicate his political beliefs through his songs. These songs remind us to avoid genocide, to be true to oneself and to strive for peace--now. I highly recommend this CD for Lennon fans, fans of great 1970s rock music and anyone who wants to experience how John Lennon taught us what was right through his music.
This is one of my all-time favorite CDs. I loved all the songs on this CD except one. My favorite is "Black Girl Pain" and it should be an anthem and inspriration for Black women all over the globe. I had the pleasure of seeing Talib in concert a few months ago in Atlanta and his live show was even better than his CD. True Hip-hop lives
In the early 60's Etta James was to RB what Patsy Cline was to country. She could cross over and yet remain true to her roots, and that's only one part of a nearly 50 year career! From the velvety cross over soul of At Last to the hard driving Memphis soul of Tell Mama, this is one legend who certainly deserves a wider audience than she has today. She ranks right up with Aretha Franklin as an influential vocalist. I took far too many years to discover her power. If you haven't given her a serious look yet, stop wasting time and begin here
This guy is going to become big someday.    I agree with this reviewer: "The songs on "Seven Swans", with a folksy bucholic feeling that runs through most of them, tell of spiritual tales. They tell of love that transcends the body and age. Sufjan can appeal equally to the Christian person as to the one who practices Zen Buddhism. And that is something few songwriters can accomplish. Keep an eye on Sufjan for years to come."  I have fun tooling around with "To Be Alone with You" on the guitar, such a simple but infectious melody.  "SEVEN SWANS" is not over orchestrated like "Michigan" and "Illinois" seem to be.  Good song to OK song ratio is about 85 percent on this one and about 45-50 percent on the the aforementioned CD's.    "SEVEN SWANS" is a great way to get introduced to the subtle musical power and overall genius of Sufjan.  Sufjan has all his own style and is not afraid to tell us who he is.  VERY CREATIVE...HE TRULY FORGES HIS OWN MUSICAL PATH.  CANNOT WAIT FOR HIS CD CALLED "WISCONSIN." 
Please do yourself a favor and buy this CD! Whatever you do, dont listen to it in your car though. No kidding aside, I almost ran my car off the road because I was laughing so hard
I INHALED this CD.  After all the hype and hyper blowin' up about this dance/punk/rock genius, I finally broke down and bought it.  Not that I was old enough to get into the discos in the mid 70's-early/mid 80's(I was still in elementary school, then middle school), but I remember(and still love) the groups that influenced this disc...The Buzzcocks, Heaven 17, PiL, Blondie...hell even the Rolling Stones "Some Girls" album.  And yes, I have to say(after finding "Death Disco-Songs Under the Dance Floor 1978-1984" CD and I'm ordering it)the old stuff is more fun.  But for the hipsters who don't know this is not original genre,it's pretty great.  No, it's very great.  The first song "Daft Punk is Playing at my House" was fun, and both discs made it worth driving through  snowy/sleety/frozen rain covered streets to work out at the gym these last couple weeks
With a compelling story, great music, great lyrics, and two outstanding female leads, Aida certainly delievers. Right from the start with the goregous "Every Story Is A Love Story", the listener is captured by the wonderful spirit of the show. The seamless tranisition between ballads and showtunes is flawless.The three stars of the show each being something different to this recording. While Adam Pascal is always great, he's the weak point on this recording. I much more prefer him in Rent, and I don't think his voice suits this show very well. Sherie Renee Scott is teriffic as Amneris, and her powerful voice fills this recording with the powerful opener and "I Know the Truth". The star, however, is Heather Headley as Aida. Her Tony-winning performance will be forever immortalized on this recording with big, raw, emotional, and powerful voice. She's is perfect in every way
I love that garage days re-re visited is on the flip side...in the cassette I had warped a long time ago!  I like this one
This was one of those rare performances where Dylan's raw energy swept the stage and transformed these selections from his collection into somthing entirely new and great. The sound is rough, the intonation is off, the recording is filled with horrible buzzes, whistles, and clicks. None of which matters. Once youe listened to some of the tracks on this disk, you'll prefer them to the original album cuts. I know I do. Absolutely essential to any collection of Dylan's work, "Hard Rain" is not to be missed.
ROCK N' ROLL history has many example of band/artists unlucky, that didn't get the recognition they deserve. Here's one.What is Big Star about? A rock n' roll, slightly psychodelic, most influenced by Beatles and The Byrds.the first record (#1 record - 1972) is the battle of two frontman putting one classic pop-rock tune after another. Chilton gets the most rock stuff, Chris the ballads, and also a contribution from Hummel, the hippy "India song".best moments: In the streets, thirteen, india song, when my baby's beside me, my life is right.the second album - Radio city  - 1973. Chris left the band, claiming that Chilton was getting too much control of everything. For this record, Hummel contributes more, the band goes torward some stuff slightly different, like the soul intended O my soul (maybe a reflection of the record label atmosphere.Chilton here also takes full control of the musical direction, the albm sounds not better or worse, but less laboured, sounding in some tracks, more like a rehearsal, with a great garage feeling.Stevens goes great on drums, specally on Back of a car.best tracks: way out west, life is white (although the harmonica annoys me a little), mod lang (very bowie mood), back of a car, september gurls.At a glance, Big Star reminds me backing home from school,playing my guitar, calling my girlfriend on the phone and waiting for the weekend to go to the beach. A feeling of youthness that doesn't come back, just like those special moments in a band's career that later, they can't catch anymore, no matter how hard they try. For Big Star, no differ, they would never do anything like these two records. And sadly after Bell's death, chances are zero to none.Why didn't they succeeded. Well, ego stuff, lack of Stax knowledge to deal with rock n' roll bands, and the dicotomy that was ruling the rock n' roll scene at the time: Hard rock versus progressive rock. And what about Big Star? Neither hard rock, nor progressive.But, despite all that rubish, Big Star is pure rock n'roll, guitar band, 70's style, recognizable in many current bands recording all over the world.Big Star is eternal.
I purchased this album from Rasputina's website as soon as it was released there, and it stayed in my cd player (or technically, it stayed on repeat on my iPod) for a full fortnight after. It's full of the rock, groove, beauty, and madness that typefies the live Raspy experience.I HIGHLY recommend this cd to any fans who love to see the band live in recital, or who have not yet had the pleasure. If you don't have this recording, buy it now! Wait a minute... why don't you have it yet?The only reason I've given a rating of 4, rather than 5, is that I feel the sound quality could be a tad better in some spots; it can get a little murky. But for the most part, it sounds pretty good.I'll also mention, for anyone who doesn't know, that Zoe's latest solo cd is now available on her website, zoekeating.com. She's a wonderful artist in her own right - check it out!
For real, you gotta give this man props. I repect him and his music, but it's not my style. He still managed to make this a good album, so it's all good. Much repect. 
For any seasoned fans of The Waifs (or anyone out there with a predilection for folksy girl duets sporting brilliant guitar skills and voices to boot), 'Shelter Me' will be no departure --and no disapointment -- from what you've heard before. The album weighs heavily on The Waifs accoustical appeal. The majority of the songs carry themselves without backbeat or excessive instrumentation -- mostly it's just the girls, their guitars, and the usual, typically wonderful songwriting that comes from Josh Cunningham, the third member of this stellar folk ensemble. The title track 'Shelter Me' is a gorgeous, magnificently charged piece that will leave you reeling, "Take me now where shelter be/ before there's nothing left of me." Vikki's final track 'Spotlight' is a pure gem, emotional and raw but utterly beautiful. 'Attention' finishes the album well with that familliar Waify energy and pulse, almost blue grass, almost country, but totally wonderful.
This album is a classic, but its really short. Dead prez are the best duo in rap in my opinion. i highly recommend this and all of dead prez's other albums
This album is awesome!!!!  My favorites are Pure and Appreciate.
Wow what a great cd. I'm a big music fan of alot of different types of music and I have to say that this is one of the best cds that came out in 2004. You can't go wrong with this one. A
This is lovely stuff. The other reviews say why much better than I can, but I just had to add to the adoration
I love EVERY track on Ne-Yo's CD "in my own words!" Next let me thank Ne-Yo for bringing true R back to the industry! I dont consider songs about cheating on your bf/gf/husband/wife R R is supposed to be about love - thats why people call them slow LOVE songs. And from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist. I ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90's over and over until I got so tired of them, and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station (that plays mostly rap: a genre of music I dont like) to play "so sick" by Ne-Yo. It was a great song. This is literally the FIRST and only R album that I never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song! Ne-Yo's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too! He is a lyrical genius. His voice is soothing and melodic. Most R albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed R songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the CD out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the CD, but THIS album has ALL songs that are great. All of the tracks on this album are great, but here are the ones that are SUPERB:1. So sick - 9/10 (would be a 10 if it wasn't played over and over and with so many different versions. Although I can still listen to it over and over2. When you're mad - 9/10 (for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad. Maybe for Michelle Rodriguez fans. :) )3. Get Down Like that 10/10 (both versions) (I call it "dont get down like that") (This song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me) (if you're not a player, and proud of being faithful, this is da song for you)4. Sexy Love - 10/10 (great song. um hmmm.. what can i say about THIS one about its lyrics?.... oh yes.... this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them, it just feels like.... Magic.)This is da only CD dat ever deserved 5 stars by me, the only reason I gave OTHER R albums 5 stars is cuz i took into consideration: there was no R album that existed that had NOTHING but good tracks, and most had poorly done upbeat song
I just loved this album the songs really related to my life. It was nice to see that there was personal experience involved while writing the songs
Can't say enough about how great this record is. It still stands the test of time by remaining relevant. "Summerland," and "Mission Man" are my personal favs, but the whole album deserves raves
This album was so good to hear when it came out. I like every song on here but my favorites are "Still Dre","The Watcher","Xxplosive","What's The Difference" and "Forget About Dre. Those are my favorites but there a lot of other songs that people will like. Recommend this album highly to rap fans. Buy this album you have nothing to loose because its Dre one of the best producers in the game right now so click on add to cart and be happy you hearing this classic
Not speaking or understanding Tibetian, didn't lessen the joy of being totally absorbed by this wonderful movie, and the music from this soundtrack is the reason why. It guides you like a sherpa, gently leading you along the high trails, powerfully pulling you to the heights of ever thinning air. You are at once engulfed in the Tibetian life, you live the experience through the deep gutteral chants, singing bowls, and drums
Guys, if you've got feelings for Tim, you're gonna love this one. If you know anything about honest to God country music, this is what you look for. This guy is extremely good and his music fits
Great trip down memory lane.  Had forgotten that Paul Davis had recorded some of the songs.  "I Still go Crazy" is one of the best songs ever
O.G. Ron C did a good job Screwin'  Choopin'. He really gave the rest of tha U.S. a taste of Texas (Tha Lone Star State). Tha best time to listen to any screwed  chopped music [SwishaHouse, Chamillitary, D.S.R.(Dirty South Rydaz)] is you are throwed (drunk) off that syrup. This was a good thing that O.G. Ron C did, Choppin' Boyz Up  Not Sloppin' Boyz Up. CHAMILLITARY MAN!!
Oh! Boy! how things have change..years ago i invested thousands of dollars in a killer Dvd-audio/Super-audio multichannel surround System.This was done to capture the glory of the state of the art music mastered in the wide frequency response of 24/192kHz.Example ..Donald Fagen "Morph The Cat" dvd-audio disc..this dics captures the dedicated genuine glory of dvd-audio multichannel done superbly.Today we have the so call Bonus Dvd Audio disc packaged together for one low rediculous price only to be disappointed  with the amature quality of the 5.1 mix.If you are an audiophile like me and know the difference between the dedicated Dvd-audio disc sold between $14.99-$29.99 and the so call Bonus Dvd Disc...you will understand why iam so irritated at this new phenomenon.Today most good recievers can play back stereo recorded music in "all channel Stereo/multichannel stereo surround which sounds superior to the so call DVD 5.1 disc.The stereo version of the Beatles LOVE album is worthy of my expensive system and is highly recommended
I will state first off that I'm one of those hipster snobs who dismiss Pearl Jam's debut album, "Ten," as the whining chart-whoring pseudo-anthemizing overpriced-flannel-flying watered-down-grungifying crowd-surfer-pandering piffle that it is.  If you think that makes me inherently biased (unbalanced?) this review probably won't be "helpful" to you, and you can move on the other 250 or so reviews.  If you decide to hear me out, I promise to be fair, 'cause even though I may be a hipster snob, I can't deny to myself the sweet rockin' going on in "Vitalogy."This album represents one the best meeting points between what was then called "underground" or indie rock and the "classic" rock mainstream.  Thus the production quality is raw when it needs to be but polished enough so it doesn't sound sloppy.  Ballads like "Better Man" and its companion piece "Nothingman" are clearly influenced by Neil Young and even "Nebraska"-era Springsteen--they're sincere  emotional but not mushy  sentimental.  "Not For You," with it's lyrics about how Eddie Vedder's small table has been invaded by uninvited hordes, is a none-too-subtle complaint about Pearl Jam's status as "millions served" rock gods and a longing for the more stripped-down aesthetic of punk.  That, of course, is more directly the point of "Spin The Black Circle," an old-fashioned punk barnstormer that sounds like a close cousin to SST-era Husker Du.  For Vedder, the joys of vinyl are that they seem "warmer"--a symbol of "tradional values" in a rock 'n' roll sense: independence, hard work and homespun crafts are better than the shiny, sterile corporate plastic of compact discs.  Never mind the fact that vinyl was just as much a product of corporate culture; Vedder just feels a pleasing wave of childhood nostalgia cradling a 12" record sleeve in his arms and watching a needle bury itself into those mysterious black grooves.  Pearl Jam may be in many ways traditionalists who long for the simple joys of just playing for the kids without corporate interference.  On the other hand, the Big Corporate Evil has enabled them to reach a huge audience, which in turn helped them finance the elaborate packaging of "Vitalogy"--it's designed as a salute/satire of a very old hardcover book advising youths on good physical/mental/spiritual hygeine.  The album, therefore, aims to strike a balance between the fondly-remembered rock stars of the band's own youth (the Who, Neil Young) and the more recent indie-punks that re-sparked their interest in the Power of Rock (Fugazi, Sonic Youth)--hence the  title. The album is perhaps unnecessarily padded out with unfinished or noveltly tracks like "Bugs" and "Hey Foxymophandlemama That's Me," even though they're intended to give the album a looser and more light-hearted feel.  Still, some of the songs that work the best are gloomy ones like "Last Exit" and the somewhat proggy sea chanty "Tremor Christ" (whose title I dearly hope is meant more as metaphor than an endorsement).  Even though it's uneven, "Vitalogy" is the work of a self-reliant, even ornery band that's in full control of their ideas--even the bad ones.  It's also not their fault that they influenced the likes of true bottom-feeding whores like Stone Temple Pilots and Matchbox 20.
I love this Pretenders album and Chrissie always rocks but I love the songwriting skill of Billy Steinberg  Tom Kelley.  They wrote "Love Colours", "Night in my Veins" and the hit "Stand by You".  Her follow-up to this, "VIVA! EL AMOR!" also contains three tracks written by them.  I purchased this long after its release and was glad I did.  Steinberg Kelley write memorable hooks and good lyrics with interesting chord changes.  Something not all big names can do on their own and Chrissie wisely is aware of this.  
This cd has so much going on and going for it - it's one of the number one releases this year for jazz fans.  Lee Ritenour is one of those guitarists who sculpted much of the west coast evolutions in jazz during the 80's and you can hear why people followed his flavor on these tracks.  He's never sounded better and the musicians who contributed with him on this cd are tight and magnificent in their own right. "Blue in Green" is one of my favorite jazz compositions by Miles Davis and Ernie Watts on tenor sax more than does it justice.  "Ocean Ave." is as breezy and beachy as I think it's meant to be.  My favorite tracks are easily "She Walks this Earth" (Ivan Lins' vocals are bossa nova beautiful), "Blue in Green" and predictably for me "Papa was a Rolling Stone" with powerful, crystal clear, unique trumpet by Chris Botti and soulful, rhythmic vocals by Kenya Hathaway and Grady Harrell. I went looking for that track because I am transfixed by Chris Botti's trumpet and what I found was a remarkable cd in its entirety.  Happy me.  ;
Bone Thugs is always keepin it real. This album gots good production and of course them good lyrics. I love the beats on this album. The songs I got in my top 5 are straight bangers no doubt. This double album is a classic by Bone Thugs. You should cop this album. All tracks are 4-5 minutes long, each emcee spittin there verses, good stuff. Definately check out this album now!!!My Top 5 Songs1.Handle The Vibe2.Look Into My Eyes3.Body Rott4.It's All Mo' Thug5.Ain't Nothin Change
Feinstein is in love with the Gershwins and that passion is never made clearer than in Pure Gershwin.  Michael's love affair with Ira's lyrics, his reckless abandon to the light-hearted spirit of the familiar -- and  lesser known --phrases, more than makes up for the less polished vocal  production in this early album.  In fact, it is that very element that  sells these songs as I've never heard them elsewhere.  Michael pulls out  all stops, embracing the less-than-lily-white additional verses of  Embraceable You, with the unbridled passion of a first time  lover.  His duet with Rosie Clooney arrouses my curiosity about the movie  in which this unknown number made its debut.  What a delightful approach  Michael demonstrates throughout....  Oh, to be that young and exuberant  about life, love and music again
It would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the Mahler Eighth ever recorded; I believe it is. But it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something, because after experiencing this colossal achievement, the competition (including, alphabetically, Abbado, Bernstein, Chailly, Haitink, Horenstein, Kubelik, Nagano, Olson [Colorado Mahlerfest], Solti, and Tennstedt, among others) suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had. What sets this Mahler Eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy; of a transcendent vision being communicated, of a religious fervor. Mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work, such that he could bring us to the brink and say, "There. It's out there. You can't see it, but you can divine it" (and call "it" what you will: "God" or "Love" or some all-embracing power outside of ourselves). Most performances miss the mark, then, in one of two ways: by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand. The problem, of course, is that if we can understand it, it's no longer a vision, it's something mundane. In the closing pages of Wit's extraordinary (and that word, as well as any other, hardly begins to do it justice) performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension. You know it's there only because you're willing to take that leap of faith. And that's what I mean when I say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor. There is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion I'm referring to here.So let's look at the basic components of the performance, element by element:The sound: Spectacularly natural and all-encompassing. The soloists emerge from the overall sonic image like members of the orchestra, and the chorus, orchestra, and organ blend to perfection.The soloists: To a letter the finest group I have ever heard. There's a distinctly Slavic sound that seems altogether appropriate given Mahler's Bohemian roots, and a refreshing lack of self-importance. No operatic grandstanding here. And for the first time ever I felt as though I was missing something by not following the words (no libretto is provided, though it is available online and can be found easily enough elsewhere) because everyone sounded like they cared dearly about what they were singing. They weren't going through the motions, making pretty sounds. They had something imperative to communicate and wanted us to know it. To be honest, part II has often bored me to tears (with Chailly's performance being particularly offensive in this regard) but here I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout, impatient to hear what (and who) came next. And throughout it all, so importantly, there was a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end.The choruses: Easily the best I've ever heard. The way they rip into "Hostem repellas longius" with their shrieks in the great double fugue of part I is unforgettable, and the fugue itself, which has never reminded me more of the "rabble" section from the first movement of Mahler's Third, literally had my spine tingling throughout its entire course. That's nothing. I got chills right at the beginning of the Chorus Mysticus and six and a half minutes later they had not abated! I have NEVER experienced anything like that before. Ever. And I don't just mean while listening to music.The conductor: What can I say? He holds the symphony together with a tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with having before. How? I have no idea, but when the start of part II doesn't jar, as it usually does, you know you're in for something special. Maybe it's because the orchestral prelude there seems faster than usual, or because he finds so much inwardness in the first part (the first entry of the soloists, for instance, is so raptly caressing).The orchestra: While they don't have the "Mahler sound" that the Concertgebouw or Vienna Philharmonic may produce, there's an earthiness (but never sloppiness) that sets them far apart from the bleached, sterile sound of too many American orchestras that make Mahler sound not like Mahler.To sum up, then, I could not speak for an hour after hearing this recording, and still burst into tears at the mere thought of it, especially those radiant, visionary, and extraordinary closing pages. Record of the year; record of the century! It crowns not merely my Mahler collection but an entire lifetime of listening to great music.
If you would have told me last year that I would own an album of piano solos I probably would have laughed in your face. While I enjoy several kinds of music, most of my favorites are in the classic rock and alternative genres. The reason I bought this is my wife and I are having a baby in December and our birthing class instructor played and reccomended Brickman as a popular choice for relaxation music and her personal favorite. I bought No Words and Simple Things mainly for their absence of singing and something to play while she is in labor. I have been listening to them nearly every night since we received them while browsing the internet or doing chores around the house. It really is amazing music that is very calming and relaxing. He definitely pours everything he has into his piano and the accompanying instruments and background is fabulous. Everything everyone else has stated in their reviews is right on as well. I would definitely reccomend not only this CD but Jim Brickman in general if you are looking for a nice relaxing getaway
this is without doubt the most beautiful, moving song i have ever heard.  i cry every time i listen to it.  i will ask my family to have it played at my funeral.  the lyrics and symbolism are born of emotional genius.  the solo vocalist and the instrumentation are flawless.  this selection is the hope diamond of contemporary music
this album is a great representation of what spoon is about. great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one's ears. spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well. they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting. some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind, the two sides of monsieur valentine, sister jack and i turn my camera on. i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock. definately money well spent
This was the second tribe album i bought i was gonna get this cd before i got the low end theory but they didn't have it at the best buy i went to. I like this cd a lot but i like midnight mauraders more because phife got some more rap time and i like phife a little more than tip. Most people like tip more but i like phifes style a lot. All like all the songs but the most is luck of lucein, afterhours, foot prints, i left my wallet in el segundo, bonita applebum, can i kick it, rhythm, go ahead in the rain, and description of a fool. Man i pratically like all the tracks but the most remeberable. I wish they were still going to make another cd but its just tip coming out with another solo cd. The only complaint is that phife was only in a couple songs. This is one of my favorite rap albums with the jazz and r and b mix with the lyrics which makes this a absoulte must have for any hip hop fan is part of the tribe classics.  
The sounds were very convincing, I actually felt like I was there even my daughter thought it was really storming outside since I have a Subwoofer and was able to control the thunder intensity (all this was at night) the only thing missing was the strobe light to add to the lightnig effect. It does relax you and allows you to destress. There are other types of stress management cd's out there but if you like the outdoors and your'e not able to get away then this is what may work for you.Johnny Lina
This album is absolutely fantastic! Paul and the band are incredibly tight and sound great together. Paul sounds very loose and like he's having a lot of fun - not as serious as some live shows I've heard.The songs focus mostly on his solo records, with some Jam and Style Council mixed in (all on disc two). Wisely, only five of the twenty three tracks are from "As Is Now" and they're the uptempo ones - it's not a hard sell by Yep Roc to make you buy that album if you don't already have it.The extended jams for "Porcelain Gods/Broken Stones," "In The Crowd" and "Foot Of The Mountain" (one of my favorite solo tracks) all are focused and don't wander so they keep your attention. The crowd is energetic and into the show and are very appreciative when the Jam and Style Council classics get into the mix (although the sing-along to the album closing "Town Called Malice" is pretty lame).I haven't listened to the somewhat difficult to find "Live Wood" concert disc for a while to give a good comparison. However, since "Catch-Flame" covers all his solo discs instead of only "Paul Weller" and "Wild Wood," this is a more balanced collection. Highly recommended!personal highlights:Blink And You'll Miss ItUp In Suze's RoomPorcelain Gods/I Walk On Gilded SplintersIn The CrowdFoot Of The MountainThat's EntertainmentBroken StonesLong Hot SummerShout To The To
But a good debut album. This is when I felt proud knowin Ja was from ny. No radio friendly s*** here just street for the most part. But i guess when you were never really gangsta in the first place you can't keep talkin about it, which is why i guess he changed his style. Now the subject i wanna hit. Has anyone noticed that guy named progressive? Why does amazon allow goofs who hate hip hop trash our culture? And everytime I turn around its some damn rocker/junkie hippie. Last time i checked Rhythm and melody was part of music. I dont hear none of those when i through on heavy metal or rock. I'm tired of our music bein trashed. You know what im a go trash one of they "artist" right now
This album is by far on the greatest recent live recordings.  Sheryl Crow demonstrates her influence and talent by putting on an all star show with some of the biggest names in music history.  Sheryl shines on her own, singing some of her great hits, but it's the duets that really make the album.  My least favorite has to be the Dixie Chicks just because I can't appreciate the country flare they bring to "Strong Enough" but it's still a great version.  Chrissie Hynde, one of the album's highlights, brings intense attitude to "If It Makes You Happy", still one of my favorite Sheryl songs.  Stevie Nicks remains Stevie Nicks, giving more than enough emotion and flare to her own "Gold Dust Woman."  Sarah McLachlan's usually soft voice comes out strong on "The Difficult Kind" and compliments Sheryl's quite nicely.  My favorite rendition has to be Eric Clapton and Sheryl together on Cream's "White Room", the rock-out moment on the album.  The show is complete when all the guests return to belt out Bob Dylan's "Tombstone Blues" and close the show with a definite BANG
I won't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended. Being that I never heard all of her albums, so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin'. However for me, who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me. Some of the tracks I love, a couple I don't like at all and the rest I just like.My favorite ones are in order;EroticaRay of LightBeautiful StrangerThe power of goodbyeDeeper and DeeperThe prodution is excellent and I love the vocals. If your new to Madonna, my opinion would be to start here. But a true fan can give me lessons.
First of all Bob Dylan is certainly not for everyone. However, if his style is up your alley this is a classic. You can turn on the radio and hear all those classic songs of his like "lay lady lay" or "like a rolling stone" to name a couple. Planet Waves is the type of album where the sum of the songs come together wonderfully. This is probably my favorite Dylan album and I have all the "classics" like Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks, Highway 61 revisited. ect. I'd recommend this to any Dylan fan
So, Incubus rocks no matter who you are or which of their albums is your favorite.  Plainly put, this album was not my favorite of theirs.  It's good.  It's really good.  But if you're expecting Incubus good, you'll be slightly disappointed
Even though Gary Allen is a country singer, he rocks as an artist!  He has a vein of rock mixed in with his deep country voice.  This man's voice is so smooth, he could melt butter along with any woman's heart.  Guys will like him too, but he's a crooner, his ballads touch women (sigh!) and make men want to emulate him.  I enjoyed every song on this CD, but my personal favorites are: Tough little boys, and Songs about rain, both beg to be sang along with
It is good for old Eric Gale fans to be able to purchase thiscd. It will bring back many memories. It will also remind you of how great a guitar player he was. I am grateful that I've had a chance to own many recordings that he has played on. Payclose attention to She is my lady and morning glory. This is a must have cd.        jaye price                     Beltsville, md. 
I have seen Phantom on stage twice and regularly listen to this cast recording.  It is a different approach to the classic Leroux novel; one that is gentler and more romantic, but still intense and passionate.  The lyrics and music are excellent.Even if you are an ALW/PTO fan, don't miss this production if it plays nearby.
I read about Lila Downs' new CD, La Cantina, in Victor Cruz- Lugo's article entitled, "Sweet Sorrow," published in the June-July 2006 issue of Hispanic Magazine (page 76).It is an honor and a pleasure to offer these few reflections on Lila Downs' new CD, La Cantina:1.  The CD cover is awesome, a beautiful and colorful work of art illustrating  Lila in a pensive and contemplative mid-air pause with her guitarra ready to rock.  It strikes me as an example of the rising feminine in our time, awakening the historically-oppressed feminine from its slumber and into an alto canto of unstoppable and celebratory song.2.  Each track is a lively composition of Mexican corridos and sones impregnated with Lila's lovely voice that makes me feel so proud to be mexicano-chicano-hualahuisense and a member of our precious universal human family.3.  I first was introduced to Lila Downs and her musical talent when I enrolled in writer Juan Felipe Herrera's legendary Manikrudo Summer Arts class at Cal State Fresno in 2000.  Juan Felipe invited her to our class room and she impressed us all with her down-to-earth talented voice.  Later that night we all saw her in concert at the Tower Theatre in Fresno and I've been a fan of her work ever since.  4.  This new CD is indeed a delightful experience.  I appreciate that she moved into the corrido, son, etc. genres which makes me appreciate her music so much more.  It has so much more appeal to me without bordering on the commercial and superficious.  It's authentic and retains its articistic musical integrity.  I think that this is a hallmark that we can expect from all of Lila's work.  She is a true artist.  I've always appreciated her darker and earthier songs in her first two CDs, however, this new stride into popular folk corridos is a movement into another aspect of the heart and soul of the mexicano experience.5.  I am very impressed with Lila's voice and how it has matured since the summer of 2000.  There seems to be more color and flair in it and definitely mucho corazon. Ahua! Her solos in "Yo ya me voy," have my soul spinning to the outer edges of infinity.As Victor Cruz-Lugo writes, "Through it all, Downs' powerful alto voice cuts a path into the deepest pits of your heart, tears something out of there and somewhow we as listeners wind up asking her for more of the same."  This is my favorite of Lila's repertoire.  It is my opinion that those who purchase this CD will not be disappointed.  Enjoy!   
If you're a Strummer fan who is an historical completist then you'll want this disc.   Also, there are some really good tunes on here for anyone, particularly Joe's "Keys to Your Heart".  Some of the live material here is high quality and some is not.  This is likely not a CD you will listen to over and over again as you would artists who are fresh.  But, I'm just glad this finally appeared on disc as I've always wanted to hear it and as a Joe fanatic, I had to have it.  There's moments here that sound like a rough draft of JS and the Mescaleros, but also moments of pure rock 'n roll circa mid 70's with some great guitar solos.  If Joe had not been where UK punk started after this band there's no telling what he would have done but you can be sure he'd have kept playing in a band.  I'm a huge Clash and Strummer fan, but I rate this 4 stars more for its historical significance than for the actual quality and uniqueness of the content
Wonderful cd the music brings back a lot of childhood memories! A must have for those who are looking for a cd that includes Neil Diamond's top hits.
I bought this out of a cut rack for $3.99. It sat in my CD tower for at least 5 years before I ever really listened to it.I couldn't stand the way it sounded over my stereo and I came close to trading it.I brought it to work and put my headphones on and it sounds like a completely different album.I really like the whole experience. I'm lucky I brought it up here-it was going nowhere at home but I'm playing it a couple of times a day over my headphones. I don't know anything about this band,I bought it on a whim,but I'd reccommend this album and I may follow up on this band
There is a reason why Styx was the first musical act to have 4 triple platinum albums in row!  Find out why. They are a unique band, with their own uncatagorizable style and sound.  Not hard rock, but can rock. Not pop, but catchy melodies and great three part harmony.  Not art rock, but themed concepts in their writing and dramatic tempo changes and crescendos in their music.  It is probably true that Lady was the first power ballad, though Styx was not credited for it.  Lady paved the way for other rock bands to showcase their softer sides.   Perhaps Styx was not always successful in their attempts, but they took chances artistically and musically and should be given props for doing so.  Every song on this CD is great; however the two that stand out for me are Too Much Time On My Hands and Suite Madame Blue.  Most people who have spent time in neighborhood bar will would likely agree that Too Much Time On My Hands is witty, funny, and true.   Suite Madame Blue a song which is a metaphor for the United States is simply One of the Greatest Rock Songs Ever!! The lyrics of Suite Madame Blue are as powerful as the music, and this song contains all the elements which made Styx great
this is quite a sharp turn from francine's previous album (40 on a fall day)... whereas the last album was closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble's work in poundcake, this time around it's quieter, subtler, sweeter and sadder. make no mistake, this is a break-up album. even those songs that make no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold, lonely, hug-craving feeling only the best break-up albums can.the mood will draw you in and keep you listening, but after a few listens it's the songs you'll fall in love with. ahh, the songs. they're densely packed with chord changes, odd but appealing lyrics, and unexpected instrumentation. they're hooky without being obvious (a francine specialty). this was my favourite album of 2003, and i still listen to it pretty often these days.best tracks: this sunday's revival, silver plated 606, novelty, 13 years.best lyric: "read a year old mail / now you should've told me / i've been repeating myself / only far less convincingly
I am very satisfied with the 1999 CD by Prince.  It was in top condition when it arrived.  I would purchase again from the seller.thank
I'm biased, because I loved the movie and adore the book.  Gregson-Williams does an outstanding job here (before this, I was most familiar with his score work on Metal Gear Solid videogames).  The music is extremely touching and magical.  The "Evacuating London Score" (from the scene in the train station) tugs at the heartstrings.  And the "Battle Score" brings back the images of the dynamic battle at the movie's climax.  One song that's missing is the 1940s jazz song played in the movie when the kids are playing hide and seek.  Other than that absence (probably due to copyright restrictions), this is an excellent CD.  As for the "Bonus" DVD - I probably wouldn't purchase it if I had a second chance.  It's got some nice gallery art of movie stills and concept art.  There is only one trailer, and it is not the very first one released, which opens with the kids at the mansion and really gets the blood pumpin' with its intro of the wardrobe.  There are also behind-the-scenes interviews I haven't watched yet, but I wonder if they'll appear again when the movie DVD is released.  
Loreena has a pure talent for weaving melody music and words together. Her song The Highwayman is absolutely astounding to be able to put the old poem into music melody and verse is quite amazing
I saw Midlake at festival recently and had never heard of them. The live set was strong enough to convince me to order some albums and I'm now a solid fan. The opening track, Roscoe, reminds me a bit of Adrian Belew, a bit of XTC and a whole lot of Midlake themselves. It's like suddenly realizing how Coldplay should sound. The music is layered and atmospheric with a bit of an eels feel. Midlake is definitely their own band, for all the influences I'm throwing out. They make the sort of music that feels old, like your favorite album you lost long ago. Try 'Roscoe' or 'Young Bride' for an indication of their style. If you like either of those, you need to buy the album.
Everyone has their favorite Beatle. Some people love to complain about Paul's solo music, comparing it to John's. The fact is that each of the Beatles had their own style, and together they had a magical symbiosis. Separately they each pursued a solo career that simply solidified what we already knew. So Paul's music is light hearted? Maybe even silly? Sure, but if you are like me and enjoy each Beatle for what they brought to the group, then this is a wonderful album. No you won't find deep soul searching here, just fun! And fun is what this album has in abundance. So if you want to curse Paul for his naivet, don't buy this album. If you loved the Beatles, and enjoyed each one for their individual talent, this is a fun solo album. In my humble opinion it is Paul's best solo album, as he really spreads his "Wings" and you can hear the sense of freedom coming through loud and clear. Later albums seem to become too engineered, and never seem to have the same energy that this album has.
At first I didn't think there was enough new material on this soundtrack to make it worthwhile, but the four previously unreleased songs are so completley wonderful, especially All I want to know and Heather.  This is an essential for any Stephin Merritt fan
Del spits brilliant lyrics and produces excellently... the beats of songs merge together as tracks change... El-P makes a cameo... Casual makes a cameo... Prince Paul produces a track... get this album
I rarely write reviews, but I need to comment on how fantastic this compilation is.  I have a four-year-old and an eighteen-month-old, and this CD is in heavy rotation at our house.  My husband and I love the music at least as much as they do -- it's stylish and sets a great mood as we're making dinner and doing dishes.  The kids love it too, needless to say.  My four-year-old's favorites are Three Blind Mice (she loves when the farmer's wife squeaks that she'll give back the tails) and the final track by Peggy Lee (where she says the word *poop*, as in "party poop" -- endless laughter ensues).  Ella Fitzgerald's A-Tisket, A-Tasket and Chew, Chew Your Bubblegum are priceless.  All in all, I highly recommend this CD -- everyone will be happy to hear it again and again
Pinback BLOWS me away.  I consider my taste in music to be very diverse, with a tendency to love obscure indie rock-pop, from the last three decades (talk talk, split enz to elliot smith and death cab).  Pinback delivers some of the best, most consistent music I've heard in YEARS.  I started with Summer in Abaddon and was weak in the knees, then I acquired their debut album and could barely stand...and now, Blue Screen Life has about knocked the breath right out of me.  I haven't gotten through the entire back catalog because I can't stop listening to the three albums I have in my hands.  Words cannot express how fascinating this band is - intricate  complicated with a simple, straightforward delivery.  Their transitions are SICK.  They put their contemporaries (death cab, the shins, the killers) to SHAME.  I love all of the aforementioned bands, but Pinback slaughters them in delivering well conceived, perfectly executed, diversified albums that you can listen to from front to back, over  over.  How many albums can you say that about?  They are heavenly.  The standouts are XIY, Boo, Concrete Seconds, Bbtone, Prog, Pene... oh, screw it - every song is GREAT!
Sam Moore's new CD is a welcome return to the roots of soul.  This CD has got IT!  Sam's voice is superb and the duets he does with his guests are wonderful.  I'm not a fan of country music so I was a bit fearful of what Wynona and Travis Tritt would do with Sam.  Wow!  Are they ever good!  Wynona's got it.  I'm going to listen to more of her now.  The musicians are the best!  I thought I could hear that wonderful touch of Earth Wind and Fire on some of the numbers so I went searching the notes.  Sure enough--there is Reggie Young--the wonderful Earth Wind and Fire trombonist!  Go Reggie!  Billy Preston is wonderful on "You are So Beautiful" as is the accompanying guitar by Eric Clapton.  This is a musician's CD--quality all the way.I have had the great pleasure of seeing Sam Moore and Billy Preston  in person (with Bowzer's Doo Wop Party--thank god for Bowzer, bringing back all these wonderful artists) and they were wonderful.  I'd love to see even more of Sam Moore.  Thanks to Randy Jackson for putting this together.  This is a class-act. 
When I bought this I played it on repeat for about 45 hours.  Different versions than on the album (I think it's their demo).  This version of Modern Age is amazing.  Definitely worth buying
I have a few hundred surf CDs and I would have to say thet this CD is my favorite! My next favorite is their new CD called "Headin' Out". They have the reverb and the composition that just makes all of the songs fantastic. If you like instrumental surf you will love this CD! Buy it you won't be sorry
As a fan of both celtic traditional and bluegrass music I was wary of a CD claiming to be a hybrid - too often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original flavours become watered down and insipid. I need not have worried - Tim O'Brien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding musical journeys I've followed for some time. Not only do the players from the two traditions blend instinctively and harmoniously but the tracks , mostly songs, are marvellous vehicles for new and exciting directions. There are superb performances all round, vocally from O'Brien with guests Paul Brady, Maura O'Connell, Kathhy Mattea, Del McCoury etc and musicians Altan, Frankie Gavin, Jerry Douglas, Earl Scruggs, Seamus Egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh, acoustic and vital, requiring no production gimmicks or effects. Standout songs for me personally are Mountaineer is Always Free, Lost Little Children, Wandering and John Riley although there is not a weak track on the CD. It is obvious that for Tim O'Brien this has been a labour of love. If you like acoustic music, from any tradition, either side of the Atlantic, you'll love it. Several of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is brilliant
NWA was an original rap group and with that being said, this is definitely a must have album for rap lovers. Along with Public Enemy, NWA christened their genre with hard core lyrics and tight bass beats. Although I don't agree with some of their lyrics, one would not expect this white kid to fully understand their view on life. Anyways, buy this album, I recommend it. Keep it away from the kiddies though
Of course, no jazz musician can pack the energetic wallop that Dizzy could.  His trumpet can only be described as HOT, and hearing his music makes you think of people dancing their legs off with garbage cans burning all around and smoke in the air.   This man's music has LIFE in it. Unfortunately, the REAL energy to Dizzy is in his Latin Jazz work, and a more complete compilation of that style would be the Compact Jazz series. Ken Burns' collection here is more versatile, but just not as lively as Dizzy's music can be.  Proceed with caution
While not dissimilar to other excellent acts such as Coldplay, Keane, and Pete Yorn, Travis have distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style and sound. This, their 2nd album, is the best of their music: melodic throughout, with catchy tunes, solid lyrics, and tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first chords of 'Sing' to the fade-out from 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song'.If you buy an album once you know three or four or more of its songs are excellent, then I confidently recommend The Invisible Band to you. Rating each song individually for one's ipod: 1. Sing, Side, The Cage, Afterglow and the Humpty Dumpty Love Song are each worthy of four to five stars2. Pipe Dreams, Flowers in the Window, Safe, Follow the Light, and Indefinitely are three to four star songs3. The balance are two to three stars each. The only poor effort is probably "Last Train", which is too plodding relative to its counterpartsThe Invisible Band is basically a healthy mix of folksy, hopeful songs mixed with just the right amount of melancholy. Nowhere is this better reflected than in 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song', which defines this mix perfectly. While this is the best of the album, the rest is well worth listening to repeatedly.  Highly recommended
I really think it's Simon's best.  This, and perhaps (in a very different style) "Paul Simon."  I'm just listening to it again after several years...the melodies are intricate, the words are vivid and allusive, the range is astounding.  Graceland has a wonderful rock-style going on, but I really think this is my favorite.  I know a lot of non-Simon fans who love this one album.  It's just fantastic
Blue Note was on the mark to re-release this classic. Tina Brook's style of blues laced jazz is a sound that will bring joy to your soul. A must have CD for any jazz collection
This CD is absolutely wonderful. I am in Australia so Strawberry Shortcake merchandise is not as readily available down here as it is in the USA, so you can imagine my daughters delight when this CD is being played.The songs are just gorgeous - I just wish they were a little longer.I thoroughly recommend this item to any little SS Fans.
Comparing Gogol Bordello and JUF is like comparing apples and oranges. I have seen Gogol live more times than I have fingers and toes to count on. When I bought JUF I did not expect to hear anything remotely resembling a Gogol album. This is a dancehall album. You like it or you don't, but just remember it is a side project. It does not make any sense to compare it to other Gogol albums.Listen before you buy
This CD brings back memories of the early 60's when Vince Martin and Fred Neil played at The Flick , The Coffee House, and the Hootenanny here in Miami.  I've had the LP forever.  Now that I'm getting the CD, I can listen in my car and remember seeing them perform live
This is a fantastic holiday Christmas album. Doris Day's beautiful voice singing these terrific Christmas songs make for a beautiful sound that will bring all who listen years of enjoyment. A must have for those who enjoy hearing terrific Christmas music over the holidays
THIS ALBUM IZ OFF DA FREAKIN CHAIN!!!!! GREAT MUSIC AND GRACE SLICK IZ THE BEST!!!!!!! THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!
Sidney Bechet was one of the first real fathers of jazz. Burns puts together a great combination of early recordings. Jazz historions note Bechet as one of the only horn players that could keep up with Louis Armstrong. You have to include Bechet in your Jazz collection, and this one is as good as any
Great compilation of songs from Massive Attack, all of their singles plus new never release songs. The videos are great and their new single 'live with me' is a great song (very sad video though). Includes new version/remix of 'I want you' with madonna. The combo is great you can own ALL of the videos, is a lot of fun to see the videos from blue lines until 100th window from the 90s all the way to the new single, the changes in the way they used to make music videos. There's even the first video with Tricky). A must have for any massive attach fan, and if you never heard from this band, you get the best of the best with this cds/dvd. Massive Attack is a band that had influenced a lot of artist from Bjork, Tricky, Madonna, Morcheeba, Portishead, UNKLE, etc.  
I love this album. Mc Lyte is one of the best female rappers.How can someone not like her rap
I supposed I should not have been watching this movie when I was nine years old, but I remember seeing it several times via HBO. More importantly, my father bought the soundtrack and we used to listen to it over  over in the car. The songs stuck with me for years, and every know and then I'll hear something out of context and I'll be taken back to roadtrips with my family.  It's something that I won't think about for ages, but when I'm reminded of it, I can't believe I don't still have a copy of the soundtrack. I remember it had quiet and comforting songs mixed in with songs you could sing along too. It's perfect for driving and just having on in the background
This soundtrack cd is the perfect compliment to the visionary film--Cater Burwells score is a pitch-perfect aural equivocation of the profound sadness and blithe absurdity on display,with his sense of minimalist suggestiveness and rich textural instincts shining bightly.Also an added bonus of the above-mentioned dream combination--Bartok's Allegro(I know diddly about classical music,but Bartok rocks!!),and a typically great Bjork songAmphibian(in two versions),that book-ends the album with an etherial,dream-like haze
I would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years Into Eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here!! I think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is Tim Roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful (ive learned some of their songs this way) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just never see that these days. And the rest of this band has so much talent, Stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting. Plus jims drum work, how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers, he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well. This album plain rocks,  It should be known as these guys were on Gigantour and rocked there too. Be cool if them and annihilator went on tour.  I have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound the same!
The progressive metal world better wake up and take note of this outstanding band that hails from Poland. These guys are a breath of fresh air with the oversaturated and stagnant progressive metal market that has developed over the past few years. So what do we get for our money you ask, a band comprising of well-schooled musicians, incredible song writing skills and the ability to weave so many different moods and time-passages into each song. There are a few scatterings of influences that aren't a major detraction from the overall mood of the album, namely Dream Theater, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Genesis and Anathema.The vocals are clean without a trace of an accent,however they get getting slightly gruff in places but this only compliments the smooth flow of the music.  The guitar work is outstanding and David Gilmour from Pink Floyd is a strong reference point here. The rhythm section is outstanding; especially the drumming and the keyboards give the album a fuller sound with out being too over powering. If you want to start 2007 on a good note then Riverside is a worthy investment for sure.  
Back when Blondie was being hailed as the biggest new-wave band in pop music by fans and critics alike, there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed Blondie as "bubblegum pop," and one group that would never have staying power. But I think it's been observed enough how the group has had the last laugh. Parallel Lines helped establish Blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following into commercial success. This album is also the first where Debbie Harry's voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a sweet, vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind disco grooves the next. The album made punk, pop, and disco shake hands, which was a method unheard of in 1978. Songs like "Hanging on the Telephone," "Picture This," "Pretty Baby," and "Sunday Girl," have become irresitable pop gems, while "I Know But I Don't Know," and "Fade Away  Radiate," featuring a terrific guitar lick by Robert Fripp, are punk-driven classics. Last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting played on the classic rock stations of today in "One Way or Another," and "Heart of Glass." And how has Debbie Harry played out as lead singer after all these years? As Rolling Stone stated when this album was ranked #140 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, "Madonna was surely watching." 
I loved this album.  Strangely enough I was introduced to the title song by Gray's Anatomy where I just had to find out who was singing that lead (Alice Russell).  The rest of the album is like the R B music I grew up with.  Definitely worth a listen
I've always written how the American NOW compilations do not even come close to the British ones, and my opinion has not since changed. NOW 20's track list, however, is solid and pretty good for the American series. It has mostly good rap songs (which can be sometimes rare in this series), great rock songs, and not an overload of mediocrities. I'll go in depth.1. Missy Elliott Feat. Ciara  Fatman Scoop - Lose Control...AA great rap song - Missy Elliott has a great style and her lyrics are actually understandable and enjoyable. Ciara is a nice addition to the song. Fatman Scoop's random screaming in the background wasn't essential, but it at least adds some energy to the track. The music's actually interesting and something different from everything else.2. Black Eyed Peas - Don't Phunk With My Heart...C+Their first album was stellar, and their second is as well. But this was one of the worst tracks on "Monkey Business" and did not deserve to become a single. Annoying, but not horrible.3. Pussycat Dolls Feat. Busta Rhymes - Don't Cha...A-A really good rap song - Busta's rapping is a good addition to the song, making this radio remix better than the original on the Pussycat Dolls' album, "PCD". A dangerously catchy chorus elevates this song to a pretty high grade.4. Rihanna - Pon de Replay...B+Pretty catchy, and a good party song. But it gets pretty irritating after a while. And the "dip it low and you pick it up slow" from the first verse directly copies from Christina Milian's "Dip it Low". That's so unoriginal, Rihanna!5. Ludacris Feat. Bobby Valentino - Pimpin' All Over the World...BGood music, but it's not much without the video, which was, by the way, partly shot in Africa.6. Bow Wow Feat. Ciara - Like You...BBow Wow's returning to the rap scene was really unneeded, but Ciara's chorus makes this song better than mediocre.7. Dem Franchize Boys Feat. Jermaine Dupri, Da Brat  Bow Wow - I Think They Like Me (Remix)...CThis song does not deserve the publicity, and I'm stunned why people like this. It's worse than mediocre, it's horribly irritating. And much of the song is bleeped out because the original is so dirty. Rap just isn't rap when it's edited, and this song is proof. But even without the editing I don't think this song has a chance. Annoying "yep"s in the background and mediocre rapping...just skip it already.8. Destiny's Child - Cater 2u...B-Mediocre for Destiny's Child. Actually pretty boring. But they have great voices.9. Lyfe Jennings - Must Be Nice...C+Mediocre.10. Natasha Bedingfield - These Words...AA great "new" artist who actually found success with this song a year earlier the US. Great songwriting about bad songwriting (if that makes any sense at all) and a good voice. Now I'm just wondering when her brother Daniel's going to release another "If You're Not the One".11. Kelly Clarkson - Behind These Hazel Eyes...A-The only American Idol who earned over twenty minutes of success, Kelly's finding massive success with her second album, and for a reason - she's got an awesome voice, and pulls off rock quite well. This song was brutally murdered by the radio, but that's why I've moved onto the remixes (not on this album).12. D.H.T. - Listen to Your Heart (Unplugged Version)...AThough Furios F.EZ's hard trance remix of this song is a lot better than this unplugged piano version, this amazing cover of the Roxette track deserved all the fame it got. Edmee's got a fantastic voice and this is a perfect song for her. Beautiful song also.13. Backstreet Boys - Just Want You To Know...A-The Backstreet Boys' newest album  must have been the #1 most unwanted comeback of all time (let's just hope N*Sync doesn't follow...*cringe* Justin Timberlake), but this is their best song. And this comes from someone hard to impress by the Backstreet Boys, but they pull off this rock song pretty well.14. Click 5 - Just the Girl...AA really good rock song which many can relate to.15. Franz Ferdinand - Do You Want To...BAtonal, but Franz Ferdinand has a good reputation, so I'll let it slide. But this is definitely evidence of a sophomore slump.16. Weezer - Beverly Hills...A+Unfortunately it was flattened, torn apart, and buried alive by the radios, so I will review it as it was still last summer when I first heard it. This song is amazing and the chorus is way too catchy to believe. But I don't need to write this, as most people already know.17. Fall Out Boy - Sugar We're Going Down...AAn amazing song, but it's only good if you can put up with songs where you can't understand what they're saying. Seriously, it took approximately six times looking up the lyrics to actually realize what's being said here. But the music is great, and this song overall is a pretty good rock track.18. Lifehouse - You  Me...A-An instant classic.19. Coldplay - Fix You...A+I've read mixed reviews about this song, but personally, I think its amazing. Following a vaguely similar buildup as Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven", this song just keeps you listening until the end. The rockout part at the end is magical.20. Keith Urban - You'll Think of Me...BIt's somewhat annoying that Keith's been on NOW albums consistently for a while but his songs aren't as popular as, say, Gretchen Wilson. I'm starting to think Keith's been put on these albums not for popular songs but just so a default country artist could be there. A good song, but it could've been replaced with something better in the Country department.So overall, this is a great selection of songs, some amazing, some decent, and some mediocre to bad. I'd suggest you buy this, as it's a good list of tracks. Overall, this album gets a B+.
There are plenty of reasons to get this Dead Album.  One is the fact that this is probably the best recorded Psychedelic CD of all time.  It was the first Rock album recorded on a 16 track.  In fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology.  The remaster is splendid.   Another good reason is the great bonus tracks.  Almost 80 minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your SUV to the record store.  Can you dig it
This remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound, but the only way top hear Aoxomoxoa is to find a original W7 (Warner Brothers-Seven Arts) green label vinyl pressing. The CD features the 1971 remix (like the 1989 CD) in which 1/3 of the backing has been stripped like Constanten's prepared backrounds on "What's Become Of The Baby", the extra drums and barbershop vocal on "Doin That Rag". St Stephen lost something in the remix as well. Anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on CD. No hidden goodies on this disc, but the bonus tracks are great
This album is simply one of the coolest things around, and when I listened to it, it inspired me to a similar project using the same 'weaving and zoning from place to place' kind of method. What this basically is, are field recordings of various different indigenous and mainstream musics from mostly Indian/Middle Eastern/Oriental festivals; they are then mixed together nicely into one flowing peice. You get Indian gamelan, mussette accordion, vocal choruses, foreign tongue talking, and psychadelic bagpipes all in one 33 minute track, and then some. It's very trippy, and it hints at some kind of endless dream where we flow from place to place without reason. Get this for your own good
Back in the 70's and 80's, I listened to a really great radio station, WSGS in Hazard, Kentucky. From my home in Flat Gap, Virginia, and anywhere in the region, it was well known that if you wanted real country music, you simply had to turn on WSGS. 100,000 watts of pure, monophonic country music. I'm not talking about the big hats of Nashville, or the gussied up ladies who pose as country singers these days. No, it was the real thing, including local and regional bluegrass, gospel, hiccup preachers, Loretta Lynn, Lefty Frizzel, Merle Haggard, Bill Monroe, Grandpa Jones, and countless others.    When I listen to this Pattly Loveless release, I think she must have been listening too. It sounds just like the typical afternoon group of selections on old WSGS. Only better, because Patty is from our time, and seems to have that old time, mountain shout-it-out style much like many of those who came before. She reminds me a bit of Wilma Lee Cooper. What a voice!    If you have never heard of these early country artists, and you like the way Patty does it up here, it would be good to go back and see where she learned all this great music from. This is the real thing
Saw this fella in 'You see me laughin' on IFC.  Good straight ahead delta style blues.  This is the real deal
With all the recent praise heaped on Smile, Orange Crate Art still remains largely under-recognized and under-appreciated. Sure, Smile was supposed to be this grand Copelandesque landscape of America, from Plymouth Rock to The Grand Cooley Dam. But for my money Brian and Van Dyke Parks did it so much better with Orange Crate Art. Having written, what everyone unanimously agrees to be the most California of all anthems, Fun Fun Fun, I Get Around and California Girls, Brian turns his attention to a California not of Hot Rods and Surf, but of sun drenched valleys rich with citrus and vine. Here Wilson and Parks celebrate and pay homage to the likes of Jack London and John Steinbeck. And if all this were not enough, we're treated to My Hobo Heart, a latter day Van Dyke Parks / Michael Hazelwood masterpiece. There's also the lovely Palm Tree  Moon, a dreamy little ode to a moonlit beach, territory not unfamiliar to Brian. And Summer In Monteray is so unabashedly nostalgic it would even make Clint Eastwood Blush. If you haven't become familiar with this so very underated collection yet, you really can't call yourself a Brian Wilson / Van Dyke Parks fan until you give this one a fair shot. You might even find yourself humming Sail Away or Hold Back Time while in the shower. I know I did
I bought this CD six months ago because I am a Miami Vice fan.  I didn't expect it to be good, but it is wonderful.  In Dulce Decorum is incredible!  This is a hard-to-find CD.  You will love it!  I enjoy it more  with each playing
For anyone who loves trumpet music as I do, this album is a must.  Wynton Marsalis has mastered twenty all-time favorite pieces with such brilliance, that no other trumpeteer comes near by comparison.  Opening with J. Clarke's, The King's March, Wynton proceeds to favor listeners with such baroque favorites as Purcell's Entrada from "The Indian Queen," J. Clark's The Prince of Denmark's March and J. Stanley's Trumpet Voluntary.  Fantastic selections from Bach, Mozart, and Haydn follow, with the album also including such delightful listening as The Last Rose of Summer, Carnival of Venisee, and Flight of the Bumblebee.  You won't be disappointed with this purchase
I have seen Joe many years ago when he had played in a group called bloodline and he is even better now
This album gives me goosebumps.  I got it because of Eric Dolphy, but there is a lot more to listen to on this album than Eric Dolphy alone (though he's excellent as usual).  The inclusion of Booker Ervin gives the album the perfect texture, as his style in many ways contradicts that of Dolphy. Although the styles are different, they complement each other perfectly.  Mal Waldron is a great composer, and many of his most excellent ideas appear on this album.  The song "Thirteen" is a fine example...you'll just have to listen to it.  Everyone on this album smokes.  Get this...you wont regret it
If you liked the original Clerks soundtrack, then you're sure to love this.  Thirteen years after we heard Randall and Dante rant and ramble on about hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first Clerks soundtrack, now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs and which movie trilogy is, in fact, the REAL trilogy.  And we, the Clerks fans, get to hear these meaningless dialogues in between every music track.Oh, and did I mention the music?  Terrific!  Kevin Smith's choices are so fitting for each scene in the movie.  It's not too difficult to imagine that Kevin has been thinking about these track choices for a long time.  In typical Kevin Smith fashion, the usual array of artists are included as well as some cool surprises.  You've got your typical Soul Asylum and Alanis Morrisette as well as King Diamond and an unexpected Jackson 5 dance number.  If you have not seen the movie, please make sure to do so before purchasing the soundtrack.  Doing so is sure to give the songs so much more meaning as you listen to them.  Overall, a really good soundtrack compilation that is sure to please any Clerks fan.    
I am not Jewish, but you don't have to be to enjoy these songs. This album happens to be one of my favourites of the Putumayo releases. A couple of the songs were instantly familiar to me even though I thought I knew none of the songs when I bought this album. Each and every song on here is wonderful...some are traditional folk songs while others are newer compositions. The 23 page booklet includes a 3 page history of Jewish music, and each artist has a page about them, including a photograph. I highly recommend this album to just about everyone. My husband is Arabic and he too loves these songs. Music truly is borderless
I recently discovered Joyce Cooling. Yeah, I've been in the dark ages. She is one of the smoothest guitarists out there and she does not try to sound like everyone else. I especially appreciate her percussive use of intonations. She's got chops galore and is a beautiful woman to boot. You can hear it all in her music. Buy Revolving Door! You'll love it
Good old silly, irreverent Slade never really caught on in the US, but their melodic early-70s glam rock sounds as energetic and fun today as it did back then, and this is the best collection of their works, including all of the Slade's hit singles from the early '70s, from 1971's Get Down And Get With It to 1975's Thanks For The Memory (Wham Bam Thank You Mam).  Slade scored a whopping 11 Top Five hits between 1971 and 1974 (five of which topped the charts), and they're all here. So are their latter-day chart entries, like 1983's #2 hit My Oh My, but Slade never got better than they did at their stomping glitter-rock peak, and Feel The Noize captures them in all their glory, filled with Noddy Holder and Jim Lea's big, dumb, misspelled shout-along hits (Look Wot You Dun, Mama Weer All Crazee Now, Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me and Gudbuy T'Jane)
I have only recently become a country music fan.  I wasn't sure I would like Faith Hill, but this was the first CD of hers I purchased.  From the very first song "This Kiss," I was instantly drawn into her music.  What I love about her songs is that they are so real.  "You Give Me Love" is so real and so strong.  It's nice to hear a song that a woman sings about a man who is crying for a change.  "The Secret of Life" has taken some getting used to.  It is not my absolute favorite on the CD.  "Me" is the song that means the most to me since I have experienced trying to change for someone else in a relationship.  And "I Love You" is a heart-jerker for those who have loved someone from afar.  She has a big voice, and she nails each song on this CD.  Give it a try
This is a good collection, 15 of Supertramp's best songs and the best single-disc collection of theirs you will find. The sound is great and there are no filler songs, here, they're all great to listen to. Highly recommended
-unique-highly artistic-creative-more credit to drummers-beatifully polishe
This cd has alot of tight hits including: Nann by Trick Daddy and Who Dat' by J.T. Money. There are too many good songs to name for this cd, those are the biggest I like and I like all the others too. I can practically just  listen to the whole cd without stopping it, which usually never happens  with other cd's b/c u buy it for about 3 good songs and all the other songs  are junk. But this cd has all the Hip Hop Hits that it proclaims. I suggest  anyone looking at this review or cd, to buy the cd. It's worth it,  definetely!  One last word is that you will have no regrets buying this cd  at all I think in my own opinion.I am from St. Louie and I am telling ya'll  to look out for a new group called NELLY also, there hit single is already  out Country Grammar and cd soon to be out. Get that when it  comes out to. Peace out ya'll
This disc dates from Monk's early period before he achieved recognition and started to descend into a long series of formulaic recordings for Columbia. So it's valuable from that point of view. It's also a wonderful chance to hear him showcased without horns although the standard is perhaps not quite as high as the trio Blue Note recordings that immediately preceded it. The best tracks both from a musical and recording quality view point are an extended Blue Monk, which many consider the definitive version, and a lovely unaccompanied Just a Gigolo, which anticipates later solo masterpieces such as Alone in San Francisco. Sweet and Lovely is in a similarly reflective vein. Much of the rest of the album has a forceful, driving quality, with aggressive use of dissonance in places - even for Monk. A particular highlight is Monk tearing through These Foolish Things
As a collector of musical scores, I thoroughly    enjoyed this selection.  It is rated as one     of my favorites.  But I must warn that if you do not like     instramental style music, then this isn't for you.  But if you are then this is a must
this is a very well done record by 3 of Raps most elite personalities.  Cube, Dub,  Mack definitely knew what they were doin when they made this record.  The beats are amazing on all the tracks.  This is one you can listen to straight through and not feel any need to hit the skip button.  For me all these songs were hot from the first time i heard them.  If you're a fan of the whole West Coast gangsta rap thing, You GOTTA HAVE THIS!  My Fav tracks are "All the Critics in New York", "Do you like Criminals", "Gangsta's make the World go Round", "Westward Ho!",  "Hoo Bangin'"...although like i said, all the tracks are badass.  peac
Tosca's Suzuki is not breaking any ground, but by God they have mastered the art. This album is just so professional sounding, very nicely produced. This is how I envision trance to sound like, so much garbage out there it taked a while to sift through and find a golden little record like this. Funky bassbeats and killer sounds. It's what they call ethereal....I think. It flows so well from track to track, quite the odyessy in under an hour
Immerse yourself in the incredible genius of Mark O'Connor and his amazing chameleon-like creative ability to tease so many different moods and styles from his violin. If you like Cajun music - this is for you.  If you like Western Swing - this is for you.  If you like foot tapping fiddle with a Celtic slant - then this is for you! Classical? Jazz? Blues? Country Rock?  Then yeah - you guessed it - this is for you! This is an absolutely fantastic album - a brilliant collection of melodies that bring together some of today's greatest violinists.  Pure Genius
Right, so, you're reading this either because you are a big Oasis fan and realize that this album is wonderful, or because you've heard some Oasis songs on the ever-disappointingly-dull radio and it's sparked yer interest.  "The Masterplan" is a compilation of Oasis B-Sides that have been released over the years.  What has always made Oasis the best band in the world is the fact that the songs that they include on their "albums proper" are not necessarily their best songs.  As such, songs like "Acquiesce", "Talk Tonight" and "Stay Young" are vacant on their albums, yet they represent the best of this lovely band and are included  here in stunning fashion.  So in summary, I absolutely do not recommend you buy this album until you at least own and fall in love with "Definitely Maybe" and "Morning Glory".  To those who own and love this album, it is a part of rock history and is not to be overlooked. 
If you like music you can't help but like Mariachi From Mexico.  It is superb.  Is there another volume?  If so, tell me about it
Mr. Kimbrough done come thru with the dirt on this one.  This aint just blues music, it's soul music right in there with Isaac Hayes and nem. It's hard played and honest and that's the true pleasure of it
Fournier plays exquisitely, imbuing each note with an elegance of its own and keeping the piece lyrical yet still rhythmically precise.  Although his interpretation is Romantic, the spirit is all Bach with no egoism on the part of Fournier.  There is both serenity and tension in these recordings, and Fournier's smooth interpretation is one of the most moving recordings available
Wow! I love this spykids movie way better than the first one. I think of the first one as an introduction for the characters and the sequel is the big adventure for all the Cortezes and even more characters, like the Giggleses. We met Donnagon in the first movie, and he was the reason for the Cortez parents to go on the mission. Now we see that he has kids and we relize that he has bigger plans for the OSS. And what about Alexandra, the preisidants daughter? She is the main reason we know about the transmooker device, right? Also grandma and grandpa Cortez are joining us in this movie. I think Robert Rodregiuz did an execallent job on the sequel, Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams. ... The sequel is awesome!!!!
Can't really add much to the reviews. This is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older. I'll admit that when this came out in '94, I only bumped the singles. It didn't grab me at the time. Sometime around '97 I gave it a spin and I've been loving it ever since. There are plenty of bangers on the album, but classics like "Pour Out A Little Liquor", "Str8 Ballin' ", "How Long Will They Mourn Me", Cradle To The Grave", and "Under Pressure" make this album worth owning all by themselves. The rest of the songs are on point too -- there isn't much filler on this album. The production is handled by Warren G.  Nate Dogg (1), the awesone yet underrated Easy Mo B (1), Johnny J (1), Jay  Mopreme (1), Jay  Syke (1), Stretch (1), and Thug Music (4). I'd say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks.The only tracks that I would call skip material are "Sh** Don't Stop" and "Don't Get It Twisted". "Sh** Don't Stop" is probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and the lyrics are unimpressive. The production is on "Don't Get It Twisted" cool, but it's one of those songs that you have to be in the mood for it (in my opinion).Volume 1 is a passionate, if at times misdirected, release from the Thug Life camp. The production is nothing short of vintage mid 90's Cali vibes. It holds up very well 13 years after its release. Of course, if you're a Tupac completist, you probably have this album already. But even if you're not a Pac fan, this should be a part of your collection.R.I.P. TupacStandout Tracks: How Long Will They Mourn Me feat.

MariaS and Srayle, if you like the Guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the Winston,  Personally, I think the Winston performance is refreshing and a delightful 'twist' on Guaraldi's works.  The piano is brillaint sounding and at volume, thru a good system sounds like there's a piano in the room.  It should be emphatically understood, you are buying Winston in this case, and not Guaraldi.  I have both versions
Too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern Christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on CDs like this.  John Rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting.  The music overwhelms the senses and the joy of Christmas overcomes you as you listen.  This is one of the most peaceful Christmas CDs I have ever heard.  "Wassail Song" is incredible, and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble, this song is a must to perform.  You will not be disappointed when you purchase this CD
This CD is a must for any Horn player or lover of the instrument!  Cerminaro has tremendous technique AND extremely sensitive mucicality.   EN
I love this CD!  Everything they sing about is so true to life.  It's a great arrangement of songs
Wrathchild alone is worth the purchase of this album. Its just that darn good of a song. But hey, the whole album is good. the title track is brutally awesome, especially live on the beast over hammersmith cd (iron maiden box set). and murders in the rue morgue is another classic. then there is drifter, and the two intrumentals the ides of march and ghengis khan (who papa roach would rip off the guitar riff from for their one hit wonder song last resort). Maybe not as good as their debut album, but still a masterpeice of an album
Sony / Legacy does a fine job with this compilation, BUT it could've been much better IMO!! Here's what I did to improve this CD (fans can do the same thing!! There's enough CD space available!)...Include the FULL LENGTH VESRION of 'Encore' (the single mix has to GO!), and add the following RARE BONUS TRACKS...16. 'At Last You're Mine' (fr.'Heavenly Bodies' SDTK 1985)  17. 'Steppin' Into The Night' (fr.'Armed  Dangerous' SDTK 1986). The single version of 'Got To Be Real' is fine because it includes Cheryl's trademark "Soo-Hoo, Soo-Hoo" vocal break that's absent on the longer album version. All in All, I'd recommend this CD to anybody that wants the best Cheryl Lynn compilation, but serious fans WILL want more!!'The Best Of Cheryl Lynn, Vol.2' has been LONG OVERDUE for years, but you may have to make that one yourself until Rhino does the job!Peace, SD(of 'Chaka's World')
Coltranes recordings with his classic quartet of '61-5 varied between very good and stunning. Coltrane fans may want to get the Impulse! box set instead though (which includes this CD and the other works of the quartet
This movie was a favorite in our household and my daughters always enjoyed the karaoke a the end of the DVD, so we searched for the soundtrack.  I actually chose this volume over volume 1 for two reasons...it contains the favorite from the movie, "I want to grow old with you" actually sung by Adam Sandler and secondly, because Volume 1 contains the song that Adam Sandler sings about his ex-girlfriend, which contains quite a bit of profanity, so I didn't want to get it for my kids.  I would have given it five stars, but we find the introduction by Billy Idol at the start of the last track, "I want to grow old with you," which is dialog from the movie, to be distracting and it gets tiring to have to listen to over and over when you just want to hear the song, which I mentioned was the absolute favorite
only 2 words can describe this great Cd and they are (simply incerdible) im only 17 but i know great oldschool when i hear it and this is fantastic musi
I am 62 years old, and seen them all.  I have NEVER seen anyone as visually and emotionally stunning as Beth Hart at the Paradiso!  Simply the most powerful stage performance I have ever witnessed!  She takes every single song to an epic level of entertainment, and just plain never coasts through a song. Some of the spectators in attendance looked almost scared by what they were seeing, and most were mesmerized by her on-stage and off stage sexually potent antics!  She has been compared to Janis.  I saw Janis twice, and Beth Hart would bury Janis in any category!  I can't imagine how she can possibly maintain a level like that captured at the Paradiso for very long--it just doesn't seem humanly possible!  I am so glad someone was there with so highly skilled a video crew to capture one of the most shattering evenings of music ever.  Magnificent in its fury!
I first heard this album in the late 6o's when it was originally released.  Starting with the first track, Blood of the Sun, I was hooked.  Leslie West was and has been a vastly unnoticed guitarist treasure. His  throaty singing and driving band, featuring Felix Pappalardi, made  this band one that should be placed on the list of great ones.  Probably due to the many other better publicized bands, like Led Zeppelin  and the like, Leslie West and Mountain seemed to get shoved away into the  closet. Open the closet, you guitarists out there, and give this CD a try.  I don't think you will be anything but delighte
Like Louis Jordan, his less well-known contemporary jump/jive artist, Cab Calloway fits into an area much beloved by Americans who recall the boggie woogie era or simply love the jumpin bumpin scufflin shufflin sound of that pre-rock and roll music. Though in truth I do love Jordan more and think he was a truely protean genius who was the grandfather of RB, Calloway was the consumate showwman whose jive/jump music can't help but bring a smile to your lips and a lift to your heart
I have followed the Enigma project for a long time, and haven't found myself disappointed with a single release thus far. (That is, considering I am reviewing an older album.) 'The Cross of Changes,' the second chapter in the Enigma project, offers philosophical insight into Micheal Crtu's personal beliefs, in the form of an 'enigmatic' symphony of soft composition and chanson. While each album seems to hold it's own unique interpretation of life, I believe the purpose of this album is to inspire love, peace and wholeness within its listeners.The lyrical value of 'The Cross of Changes' seems to surpass that of its instrumental quality, which is, at times, rather poor in comparison to some of Micheal's other works. However, the lyrics are reassuring and inspiring, none-the-less, and make the entire experience worthwhile.Buyers who are curious about Enigma probably shouldn't start with this album, as it seems to be one of those things you appreciate only after hearing some of the latter releases. (In my case, at least.) The first album I purchased was 'Love, Sensuality, Devotion' (the greatest hits album) -- a good start, considering you will get a fair idea of what Enigma is all about.By the way, I am curious about track number 2 -- everytime I listen to it, I faintly hear Sandra chanting "open your heart, and push the limits..." in the background, though it could just be my imagination. It's strange that I mention that, because 'Push the Limits' was released after this album
The slowed down almost spoken version of Downpressor Man nearly makes it worth the purchase price alone.  Sure I've got most of the tracks on other Tosh collections, but these recordings are excellent variants
AC/DC is the greatest band EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! this cd has my fav song on it Rock N Roll Damnation I luv both eras, Bon Scott and Brian Johnso
One of the greatest rap albums of all time.  Wicked backgrounds and rhyming
Brubeck and Desmond work their special magic here and produce their finest live recording.  This is sophisticated improv to tame the beast.  I have listened to these tracks uncountable times and I never get tired of them.   This is truely a wistful soundtrack to transport one to a higher realm.   Try this the next time you are caught in heavy traffic on a rainy  afternoon.  You won't mind the delay.  It never fails
Sometimes, debut albums present an artist in full bloom, with an assured grasp on their sound and message. Sometimes, debut albums are nothing but promise, pointing toward what the artist could do. Public Enemy's gripping first album, Yo! Bum Rush the Show, manages to fill both categories: it's an expert, fully realized record of extraordinary power, but it pales in comparison with what came merely a year later. This is very much a Rick Rubin-directed production, kicking heavy guitars toward the front, honing the loops, rhythms, and samples into a roar with as much in common with rock as rap. But, damn if they don't sound like they've already conquered the world! Already, there is a tangible, physical excitement to the music, something that hits the gut with relentless force, as the mind races to keep up with Chuck's relentless rhymes or Flavor Flav's spastic outbursts. And if there doesn't seem to be as many classics here -- "You're Gonna Get Yours," "Miuzi Weighs a Ton," "Public Enemy No. 1" -- that's only in comparison to what came later, since by any other artist an album this furious, visceral, and exciting would unquestionably be heralded as a classic. From Public Enemy, this is simply a shade under classic status
What can you say about MFL that hasn't already been said. Sublime, perfect, classic. This is still the definitive recording of the show, and no one has ever come close to the original cast. Sadly, while the movie is wonderful, had Warner Bros. used Andrew's it might have been one of the greatest film musicals of all time. And while Audrey Hepburn gamely gives it her all, Andrew's had clearly made Eliza Doolittle her own, and she would have been uncomparable on film, and raised the level of the entire movie. Well, the rest is history, Andrews went on to be one of the biggest movie stars of the 60's.Still, probably the best example of a play being adapted into a musical. As George Bernard Shaw said (when he finally gave in and saw it during it's London run) " I don't know where Shaw ends and Lerner and Lowe begins.
I just love this CD. Over 8 years ago my much older coworker turned me onto this album. It is definetly not just for St Paddy's day. This is an album you can listen to over and over. The Sinead songs are a bit whiney, but she does have an excellent voice. You can not get better that Mic and Sting. Sting's song is just incredible.
I'm not sure what to call this CD other than genius. This was the first CD I've heard from Sonata Arctica and it's still my favorite.I'm not really really big on power metal/epic metal, but I defintely enjoy SA and Kamelot. With that said, I think this CD can even entertain those not interested in power metal. My friend enjors radio rock and rap, but after hearing me play this CD where we work, he begged me to make him a copy.Towards the actual CD, i'm not quite sure I can put what's in it into words. Songs like Silver Tongue and Broken have a very distinct, unique sound. The ballads, Draw Me and The Misery are both superb efforts, each making the listener feel Tony Kakko's pain. My favorite song would have to be a dead heat between The Misery and Gravenimage.The keyboardist in this band works in overdrive in each song. He plays fast, and keeps the melody in each beautiful and interesting (and lighthearted at times). The guitarist plays very fast when he needs to, and the right power chords other times. He's quite good. Overall, the sound they eminate is as uplifting as it is rocking. They do a great job.The lyrics seem much better than older releases (english lessons?) but still can be a bit odd. "...with long haired drummer in band" springs to mind. Still at least they write about mundane things... I love Kamelot, but the Knight in Shining armor routine will get old eventually. Anyway, the vocals are very well done, he obviously quite talented and the band harmonizes quite well, too. (They'd make Queen jealous!)Overall, I can't praise this CD enough. Every song is an adventure, none of them a tedious or unnecessary one at that. I would say that anyone could enjoy this CD, but I'd first recommend it to those who are tired of the American screamfest metal that's going on today. Then I'd recommend it to power metal fans, and so on. Simply put, this is one of the best CDs I own. Give it a chance
A great recording.  "The greatest bass solo ever recorded" (as put by another reviewer) is certainly a stretch, but the album is still magnificent.  Heavy Sounds is a title that accurately describes the music.  Buy and enjoy. 
The most juiced-up Sountern Rock around.  Check out the Tango guitar on "Too Hard To Handle" and I always get a kick out of Rick's ole' man.  It's a shame that there aren't bands like this around today. 
I must agree with the comments made by other reviewers.  This album is great.  Nancy Wilson's voice on this album is unlike anything I have ever heard.  You can't honestly say you're a fan of jazz if you don't own this
Very essential Music.The ArrangementsStyles work very well.He has Great Depthfeel here.it's Classic Ellington.He was always Constantly Changing Music
I've always been a Terri clark fan but this is the first cd I've purchased by her. I was surprised at how much I really enjoyed this cd! Terri has an amazing voice and the songs kept me listening to the cd over and over again
The Best of Taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. The albums consisted of two studio albums Taste, On The Boards, and the two live albums Live Taste, and Live At The Isle Of Wight.  This band was a power trio led by Rory Gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career.  The band led by Gallagher on vocals, guitar (electric, acoustic,  slide), harmonica, and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock.  The music has much in common with Cream.  However, the Richard McCracken and John Wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  The undervalued Gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of Eric Clapton.  Like Cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like Sugar Mama and I Feel Good included here.  The music included here is varied.  It ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of Catfish to the more acoustic cover of Leavin' Blues.  The cuts from On The Boards become more jazzy at times.  Tracks like On The Boards and It's Happenened Before, It'll Happen Again highlight the band's more improvisational approach.  Hard hitting tracks like Eat My Words spotlight Gallagher's outstanding slide technique.  Two cuts I miss from this period which are not included here are Dual Carriageway Pain from Taste, and Morning Sun from On The Boards.  The live concert favorite Sinner Boy provides a bridge to Gallagher's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album Rory Gallagher.  This anthology provides a great overview of the early work of Irish blues-rock guitar hero Rory Gallagher and his battered Stratocaster.  It is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports
Its kind of hard to deny what Krs-One has brought to the game. His flow is phenomenal and the insight he gives is precious even now. Standout Tracks: DUCK DOWN, RUFF RUFF(dope match up with Freddie Foxx), 13 AND GOOD(the story of a guy who sleeps with a teen that calls her father who is a gay cop will have you in stitches), POISONOUS PRODUCTS, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, LIKE A THROTTLE, WE IN HERE, THE REAL HOLY PLACE(the deepest track on here), WHO ARE THE PIMPS? and the reggae tinged joints like SAY GAL and SEX AND VIOLENCE are gems also. Filler: NONE! Bottom Line: BDP's six album is still a classic with a message that still isnt heeded till this day. Besides the slammin production, Krs showed that he was 100 steps ahead from the average rapper with this album. Any born again hip hop head would do well to start off with Edutainment and work their way down to this album.
Originally released in 1972,this was Can's fourth record as well as their follow-up to 'Tago Mago'(see my review).Some really superbly written and played cuts here to fully take in(might take several spins)are "Pinch",liked Michael Karoli's(R.I.P.)stellar guitar solos,the somewhat stunning "Vitamin C" and this reissue's lengthiest track,the ten-minute "Soup".First rate German progressive kraut.After I listened to this CD a second time,I realized that 'Ege Bamyasi' may have very well been a heavy influence on later bands like Gary Numan,Pere Ubu,Public Image Ltd. and Stereolab.Silly cover,don't you agree
A great sampling of one of top 10 musicians from the 20th century
this is the only albulm i have of the exies for christmas i am getting the last albulm. if its the same as this one the exies must be good.this is the best albulm i have listened to.my favourites are ugly, babtise me, splinter and dear enemymy least favourites are none i like every songits an amazing albulm. ihave listened to some of the tracks over and over again and everytime i think wowthis band should be more popularfrom craig from the uk
This record is one of the best that has found its way out since the new millenium. I am partial to good songwriting and Bill's particular folk-country-alt-emotive sound. The tracks to me all over the place and take it from someone who has been there and back -it was well worth the trip
Building a library of oldies to listen to just wouldn't be complete without this album.
Several tunes on 'Back to Oakland' feature Tower of Power at their best.  One in particular that keeps me coming back is the deeply funky instrumental track, 'Squib Cakes'.  Featured soloists include a short, mellow guitar solo from Bruce Conte, followed by Greg Adams' fluegelhorn that first lurks in the pedal range (leading one to believe it's a trombone!) and then soars brilliantly higher and higher to a dramatic finish.Tenor madness abounds from lead saxman Lenny Pickett (known primarily for his work as lead Tenor for the Saturday Night Live band), wailing in-tune in the difficult altissimo range (jazz musicians call these 'freak notes' because they are not notes typically included in the range of the instrument ... ), while at the same time refusing to compromise on excellent rhythmic and melodic ideas throughout. Chester Thompson completes the soloistic foursome with a chunky Hammond organ solo that takes you back to a smoky bar in LA in the early 70s - without the probability of cancer.  Lyrical yet hard-driving, Thompson lulls us first into his solo space by filling in behind the band as they chant 'Squib Cakes', then takes off on his own flight, delving out perfect 16th-note runs as though Bach suddenly had learned some jazz Hammond himself.  In the middle of the solo, as if to a testament to the tightness of the groove, Thompson lingers on a treble note in his right hand, chunks out chords so symmetrically with the rest of the rhythm section with his left, that in the days of hearing this on vinyl, I wondered if my record was skipping through that section!  To finish the groove, at the end of Thompson's solo, the horns return to fill in a bridge with quick triplets.  After he closes, we're back to the head to close out the tune. Even with so much to savor, this syncopated gem will leave you hungering for more, even after the final stroke of the last chord.  The musicianship and tightness of their groove more than make up for the bland lyrics on the album's other tunes.  I have listened to this album for 30 years and revel in its freshness every time I spin it. I recommend it as a definite primer for anyone wishing to explore Tower of Power's "sound."- Kathryn Shut
I loved the CD, it took me back to the days of the original recordings, however the sound was not as good as the original.  
This was 2Pac's last good album before he joined Deathrow.He was a good rapper but never the best,he started too much beef with other rappers for no reason.He had alot of beef with east coast rappers like Biggie,Nas,Jay-Z and Mobb Deep,but he never opened his mouth about Wu-Tang because they would lyrically destroy him.This is one of the best albums from 95 right behind Gza's Liquid Swords and Mobb Deep's The Infamous
On this album,Ice switches to a thrashcore style lovers of the style will go mad about.The songs are mega fast,with furious social lyrics and full of hatred.If you're into thashcoreand dig bands like Ratos De Porao,get this one at once.It suffers from some degree of dynamic compression   though,but if you can correct that,it'll blow your brains againt the nearest wall
its quite difficult to sum up the impact of this cd with few mere words. suffice to say, level 1 is a timeless classic, in fact, it was my entry pass into the realm of d-n-b. logical progressions level 1 is a must-have for all d-n-b heads  music lovers in general. demon's theme, western, danny's song  horizons remain some of my favorite songs in any genre. bukem's level 1 displays his flawless production  track mastery which cascades the listener with the ideal mid-tempo balance between dance-floor adrenaline  ambient bliss
I'll begin by saying this isn't the only "Ministry Of Sound Chillout Sessions" I've heard, in fact I love the MoS brand, so I can honestly say that EVERY single compilation has it's on flavour, from the "Clubber's Guide To" to "The Annual (Spring/ Summer/ Annual)" Which means, the previous and next instalments don't necesarily match this review. With that being said: This particular Compilation has a very elegant/ european/ underground feel to it. It's indie electronica and some rock-gone-acid-jazz, and of course, it wouldn't be European without some House music. It's fascinating that in the middle of an elephant-driven craze a song talking about taking a holiday so someone can love someone better starts to blend seamlessly. Yes, it's THAT type of record. It's not Pop, it's not a 'greatest hits' mash-up and it's definately not boring. I remember the first time I heard it (I was working graveyard shifts at that time) I'd listen to the first cd and it'd make me fall sound asleep after the first half. It's not a bad thing, it's just very relaxing, very soothing to the soul (Specially the Lior song "This Old Love", which helped me get through a rather painful breakup) Overall, it's THAT kind of session. It makes you think, it makes you apreciate it, it's a 'life soundtrack' from track 1 of the second disc ("we all live and die" from Kinda New) giving you a morning starter to the soothing track "Run (Jacknife Lee Remix)" on the first disc which invites you to THE promised dreamland. Nothing you'd expect from a regular MoS compilation, everything you'd expect from a really good chillout compilation. A MUST for any true Chillout Junkie

We can't forget about these great musicals
 The debut release entitled "Breathe" by artist called Blue Stone is one of the best New Age albums that I've heard in years! I would even go as to say that it is even better than any of Amethystiums albums. "I Am" is heavenly and "Contact" is an eerie number that is destined to be a future classic!
The performances for every sonata and every partita are wonderful. This is the kind of material one can expect from Deutsche Grammophon. Wonderful music, a wonderful violinist, wonderful interpretations, and wonderful sound (not just for its time). There are also very few "squeaks" and he is almost always right on pitch! Often called definitive, this is the one to get. Highly recommended
The only problem with Betty Buckley is that she isn't nearly as well known as she deserves to be, considering the length and quality of her career.  This album of somgs from her 1996 AIDS benefit concert at Carnegie Hall is simply flawless.  Naturally, it's heavy on music from Broadway, the London stage, and film scores, but she sings one Mary Chapin Carpenter song, Come On, Come On, that comes from none of those sources and is guaranteed to give you chills every time you hear it.  If you're tired of recordings by singers of little talent and less style, listen to Betty Buckley for fifteen minutes and you'll feel as if you'd never heard real singing before.  She is an original, and she has the best voice in theater of this or almost any decade
This CD is a classic, a must for all those who loved the movie. I wondered if I would get a crackling type of sound, but it is as crystal clear as the movie sound. This is perfect for those who want to practice the songs for a "sound of music" event or a singing class!
Rien a dire si ce n'est que Too $hort et ses potes a claque c'est tout
There is nothing more intimate then the human voice.  I am a voice major at a university.  Nothing speaks to me more highly then choral music.  I was a little skeptical about this CD when I first got it.  I have since fallen in love with every aspect of it. Of course if you get this CD you must get the companion CD Lux Aeterna by the Los Angeles Master Chorale.  You cannot have one without the other
All-instrumental collections of bluegrass are hard to find, and if you like it when a band takes a break from singing and just plays their instruments, here's your chance for total immersion. All the songs on this compilation are from Rounder Records albums released 1976-1998, by artists with familiar names like Alison Krauss and Tony Rice, and others you may never have heard of.  All are first rate, foot stompin' renditions of bluegrass traditionals, with a few great originals -- Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Breakdown and Earl Scruggs' Foggy Mountain Chimes. Best known for most listeners is a rousing version of Orange Blossom Special by the Johnson Mountain Boys. If you like bluegrass with plenty of pickin' at breakneck speed, this CD will keep you smilin' through many, many replays
I am listening to Badfinger even as I type this review.This is the Best Of Badfinger Vol 2, and I thought volume 1 was great !! As previous reviewers have said, what an absolute tragedy the story of Badfinger is (Buy the Book "Without You" the tragic story of Badfinger).Well I have everything they have released, if you do buy any of the Badfinger best ofs, you will more than likely get hooked and start collecting all of their albums.Some of the best songs on this Cd are off "Wish You Were Here" their best album by a mile IMHO.In fact 6 of the 9 songs on WYWH are on this compilation.They were such an original group with every member capable of writing an exhilirating hit song. just have a taste of "Just A Chance", "You're So Fine", "Meanwhile back At The Ranch/Should I Smoke".They were just so good, Damn I miss them
I really like this new singer, he has a style all of his own. I recently bought his new CD "A Swingin' Time" and I also had to have this, his first CD offered on Amazon. I'm really hooked on Monte Procopio's unique approach to these classic songs, can't wait for more
I never have understood how some people have an inate quality for music and some don't. Well , Willie was one of those that definately did. It is hard to imageine the blues without the likes of Willie Dixon: the writer, the musician, the producer, the businessman. I listen to his work over and over again , each time learning new nuances I did not hear before. How incredible is that 
As one of the founding fathers of today's heavy metal rock music, Iron Butterfly has them power, drive, and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. This live album serves as a testament to that fact. Eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid 1980's was primative at best (by today's standards), this live recording of Iron Butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era. This is a "must-have" for all Iron Butterfly fans
This is, I believe, the best Fleetwood Mac album ever record by the band. It begins with a nice quick paced tune, "Second Hand News" and proceeds to move into many textured songs from there.The album itself does not have a bad tune on it. In fact, of all the 'regular' albums from Fleetwood Mac (excluding Greatest Hits compilations), this album has more hits on it than any other. Hits like 'Dreams,' 'Never Going Back,' 'Don't Stop,' 'Go Your Own Way,' 'The Chain' and 'You Make Loving Fun." All of these get enormous radio play. Moreover, 'Dreams' was a number one hit, and the Album itself held the number one slot for months on end, and has sold over 18 million copies in the U.S. and over 30 million worldwide, putting into the top 50 best selling albums of all time.In fact, an interesting tid bit from the liner notes of the CD describe how the album had such an impact on America's youth that during that generation if you were to ask a student to spell 'Rumor' there would inevitably be two 'U's' in the spelling. Now that is a very strong impact on culture. Every song on this album is arranged on the album as if it flowed right into the other making for an overall well rounded album. One of my all time favorite songs from Fleetwood Mac is on this album, "Never Going Back" which contains some great acoustic guitar work from one of Rock's premier guitarists, Lindsey Buckingham, and, in my opinion, the best Christine McVie song ever written, "Songbird."Now, with this release, you can also get, on a second CD, the various rough takes and outtakes of the songs on this album. This makes for great listening, to hear how the songs developed and were recorded. Moreover, early demos are included along with two 'Jam Sessions." Now, more than ever, this is a must have CD for any lover of Rock music (or music in general for that matter).If you are a Fleetwood Mac fan, then chances are you own this album, but if you are just getting introduced to the band, then you must buy this CD. I highly recommend it
Have loved this album since it first came out years ago (bought on vinyl - lost to the mists of time). The CD was out of print but I kept looking and found it on Amazon (it was re-released), Yeah!!!!Last Steam Engine, From the Cradle to the Grave, Louise, Owls, You Don't have to Need Me - some of my favorites.This, to me, is Kottke in his prime
I don't know where this guy gets off saying that the drummer, Jorge Rossy, and the bassist, Larry Grenadier, are competent but do nothing overtly interesting.  Jorge incredible groove, use of space, and musicality is as good as one could ask for, and Grenadier's huge warm tone, amazing time, and great thematic development is unparalleled by other bassists of his generation
I finally got this cd, I have been looking for this CD for awhile now, a great by well worth it
Along with Son Volt's Trace and Nadine's Downtown Saturday, this is one of the best rock albums of the 1990s and certainly one of the best alt.country albums ever released.  Standout  tracks include Blue Canoe, Soul Sister, Eyes  of a Child, Wink and Let's Go Runnin' all  examples of first class rock songwriting.  The rest ain't too shabby  either.  Fans of the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd in particular  should give this Mississippi band a listen.  But so should any mainstream  rock fan
This is Beck's coming of age album.  "Loser" was a single that was designed from the bottom up to be a hit single and "Mellow Gold" landed Beck right smack center of mainstream pop culture for an entire generation.  His earlier recordings, featured in an album entitled "One Foot In The Grave," were evidence enough of his musical genius.  "Mellow Gold" might have represented an electro-acoustic adolescence for Beck.  If that's the case, then "Mutations" was his rite of passage, a moment of maturation that moves beyond the playful tongue-in-cheek wittiness of his previous album.  "Mutations" has dark, brooding moments with haunting melodies.  His lyrics inspire curiosity and sadness.   In one song, he sings, "Looking back on some dead world, that looks so new."  We can't always be sure of his references or implications, but the music in this album is fascinating and darkly beautiful.  His ambiguity of language is infectious and the compositions that he rests his words in are dynamic and graceful.  With "Mutations," Beck has secured an important place in music history.  This is a body of work that really goes far beyond album sales and radio play.  The arrival of this album shows us an artist finding a moment of clarity and touching the world with his craft.     
I can only say that this was my favorite record of last year. This record is hard to find in your local record store, so search it out... Incredible - can't wait to hear more!
I bought this because I thought this cd would be nice to listen to in the car while on out and about. I love that our 2 1/2 year old daughter who is from China loves this cd and will request it "Chinese Flute" please. This is just one way to keep her heritage alive and expose her to different kinds of music beyond the Wiggles  Lilo  Stitch CD.I would have liked to have had more information on the songs like what province of China. But not having this information really does not lessen the rating of 5 stars! Our family thinks this is an excellent cd
With Freddie backed by Herbie,Ron Carter,and Tony Williams.This is high-flight crisp and inspiring music.Worthy of repeated listenings. Listen and enjoy.Williams is over the top,very creative and will continue to suprise you with his unceasing inventiveness.I've  always noticed how Carter and Williams really spur Hancock on as you will notice in this set.Hancock,one the the truly great pianist of post-bop era,sounds like he is his having the time of his life.It doesn't get much better than this. 
Stiff Upper Lip is a good AC/DC album, it's not a great AC/DC album.It kills me when people say that AC/DC have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have done.  Nothing could be further from the truth.I have always thought that each AC/DC album has a sound and a feel and a story in it's own and that a track off each album would be totally out of place on another album.  For instance, can you image Shake a Leg on Stiff Upper Lip?  Or Ballbreaker on Back in Black?It doesn't work.  Stiff Upper Lip has its own kind of rough, bluesy feel to it.  Brian's voice sounds different, the tones and the guitars sound different.  It's good but not great.  The standouts...1. Stiff Upper Lip- Pretty rocking song.  Has a good attitude.  It's fun.2. Hold Me Back and Can't Stand Still.  Very odd rolling songs.  They sound a lot alike.  Again, these songs could NEVER have been on Back in Black.  I have heard that Brian sang Can't Stand Still in one take, that's why they all clap at the end.  I don't know if that's true, but it's an interesting song.3. Satellite Blues- This one is an instant classic.  I LOVE this song.  This song could have been done back in the days of Back in Black and if it were on that album I think it would be as popular as You Shook Me All Night Long.Everything else is ho hum.  Not good, not bad.  Better than most bands out there.  I am really hoping AC/DC put out a killer album with their new release, whenever that is.  I hope they don't turn into the new G and suffer from the Chinese Democracy syndrome
this one came out in '91. its one of the very few albums that included the almighty Joe Preston on bass. one of the great things about this CD is that all the songs are all on one track. so it forces you to listen to this long, winding, sludgefest in its entirety. as most Melvins fans know, this (along with Houdini) was the pinacle of their musical career. after this, they made some great albums and some good ones, but never better than their self-titled album (previously titled "Lysol", but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit). it would be ultra-cool if Ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re-issue treatment. it definitely deserves it
Released is the kind of album you put in, kick your feet up with a good beverage, and head off to someplace on the silverscreen of your mind that is pure tranquility. Oster's trumpet echoes on long after the music is off. Here's hoping there's more from this new and amazing artist
The beats is cool, but you understand his lyrics!  its not bout all that pimp trash! SNOOP NOT A PIMP...but this is a bangin C
Bo Diddley is one of the most underrated rock and roll artist. Such gems as Bo Diddley Say Man and Who Do You Love are just the tip of the iceberg. Add in the blues, like  I'm A Man and you have a truely outstanding set. The set also  includes a very informative booklet that includes a bio, pictures and  discography. Do not settle for less than what is offered here
These 3 discs (there is a limited edition 10 disc set which has obviously sold out!!)are a continuation of Live Dead. If you haven't heard the Dead Live then start with this or Live Dead. You will realise why to many they were America's greatest improvisational rock band. The playing, the interplay between the musicians - particularly Garcia and Lesh is staggering. And how about a big hand for Bill Kreutzman on drums
If you're a fan of Latin music and especially Spanish guitar, you will LOVE Cafe Tropical. Every song is different from the next with instrumentation ranging from guitar, to piano, violin, trumpet, and a whole host of spicy percussion instruments. Every time I put this CD on I hear new things, which I find makes for an even more enjoyable listen.As usual, Johannes Linstead delivers some of the most catchy and memorable melodies in the nouveau flamenco genre, and of course his guitar playing speaks for itself. Highly recommended
This guy is amazing. I keep playing this for people and they love it and tell me they have never heard anything like it. I even got a huge discount at the auto shop for just having this CD. After the mechanic took my car from the parking lot and listened to one minute of this, he came in and said"that sounds crazy! you have to let me copy this"After getting a nice chunk of cash taken off my bill, this cd already paid for itself and never collects dust.I know everyone compares Clark to Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, and Autechre, but for good intentions. He is already that good, after just a few releases
Few "metal" bands can successfully integrate melody into their music without falling back on the overused "power ballad". Tesla seems to be able to turn it on when needed, and shut it off when unnecessary. This debut from the Sacramento quintet is full of enough speed to satisfy any metalhead, yet also contains enough substance to satisfy those who want more from their rock than double kicks and 140 on the metronome.The album starts off with a great rythym section groove, then growing and ripping into EZ Cum EZ Go, a song that takes the listener up and down more often than a Valencia theme park ride. Comin' Atcha Live seems destined to be the song that the band opens their live shows with, falling back into the rif-filled melodic offering of "Getting Better". Then the pace swells again into "Too Late For Love", and thunders into the anthemic fist-pumping "Rock Me To The Top". "We're No Good Together" may start like the dreaded power ballad as Jeff Keith laments about the proverbial one that got away, but screams to a conclusion through a profusion of lightning fast (pun intended) guitar solos. "Modern Day Cowboy" is the token political anti-war statement, slows down a bit for "Changes" but up next is one of their fans' favorites. "Little Suzi" begins with a tasty acoustic piece, and progresses into the culmination of the bands' melodic songwriting talents as they chronical the ups and downs (pun intended) of a young starlet discovering the high costs of fame. I'm a little surprised at the way the album closes, though. After the huge highs through the middle of the album, the final three cuts are somewhat disappointing to me. Don't get me wrong,  they're still decent, but I would have liked these three shifted to the middle of the album and slid the rest towards the end - "Little Suzi" would have been a great way to end the album. Overall, even though the band did a lot of great stuff (including their biggest commercial success) in later albums, this remains their best body of work
No doubt about it, from start to finish, this is a classic for anybody's collection. I can remember back in the spring of '93 when the movie came out and it was a classic as well but the soundtrack matches up to what the movie was and this soundtrack sent a big message to a lot of us about what goes on the inner cities today. This was rap music at it's best from Spice 1 to DJ Quik. There will not be a soundtrack like this ever again that addresses what goes on in our neighborhoods. So add this to your collection if you still love the true gangster rap, west coast fan(like myself), or just want to hear a great soundtrack
Eddie's first all-studio recording, and the album that got me hooked.  I must say that even though they are uncomparably fantastic live, this album demonstrates the range and diversity of Eddie from Ohio.  Oh My  Brother is a particular favorite with Julie Murphy Wells displaying  her amazing range and beautiful voice, and Robbie Schaffer's talent for  emoting the absolute best of a heartwrenching situation.  If this song  doesn't touch your heart, you have no appreciation for music.  A particular  plus on this album is a beautiful violin solo of Yerushalyim Shel  Zahav by guest musician Pete Wilson on Jerusalem, another  song by Robbie, this time also performed by him.  As always, the amazing  prowess of this group is displayed magnificently
This is a really great CD. The Candian and American Idol winners are not usually that great, but Melissa is an exception. She just belts out her soul whenever she's at the microphone. My absolute favourite is definitely "Alive". It's just a beautiful song. Really, I recommend this CD who likes songs with great messages and a good beat. She's a great Pop/rock singer. You can't go wrong with this CD
I've been listening to Satoshi Tomiie for a long time and this is definetly one of his best CD's yet. Its one of those cd's that is a must have before a road trip. Just play it and let it ride. From beginning to end it keeps your ears on high alert just waiting for that next track to hit. Before you know it your at the end, but who says you cant just hit repeat and start the ride all over again.
The music intelligentia probably won't like James Morrison's new album because almost everybody else will love it.  Bourgeois = uncool.  However, if you just listen and feel this album, even if you have snobbish tendencies, it will move you.  Enjoy this amazing new album.  I am
"Burnin'" was the last album by the Wailers as a collective group, afterwhich Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer left the group to pursue solo careers and Marley reformed his group, calling it "Bob Marley  the Wailers" in 1974.  The album shows the original three at their best, balancing lead vocals on several songs between Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, and Peter Tosh.  The album not only serves to further reveal Bob's soon-to-be legendary work, but also to show the talent of Bunny Wailer with his lead vocals on songs like "Hallelujah Time" and "Pass It On".The album also shows Tosh taking lead with Marley on "One Foundation" and alongside Marley on "Get Up, Stand Up".  The album's biggest gem, however, was "I Shot the Sheriff," soon to be made a favorite in the U.S. and the U.K. by rock artist Eric Clapton on his 1974 "451 Ocean Boulevard" album.The deluxe edition also features a concert from the tour in Leeds, U.K. just one week before the Wailers broke up.  (Bunny, however, was already absent, having refused to tour outside of Jamaica once and for all earlier that year.  His temporary replacement,the Wailers' old vocal coach, Joe Higgs was also absent, quitting the tour after they completed their shows in the U.S.)  1973's "Burnin'" shows the original Wailers at their very best before their breakup and is a timeless classic for music fans everywhere, I can guarentee it
The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse is a groundbreaking suite, full of intriguing new sounds and grooves. Ellington didn't fade into predictability and mundanity in his last years; instead, his compositions became more and more original and exciting. This suite has rocking, swinging, waltzing grooves that, though seemingly disparate, work together and illustrate the theme stated in the Duke's spoken introduction to the suite: to show that "the whole world is going Oriental, and that no one will be able to retain his or her identity... not even the Orientals." Duke doesn't leave his standbys behind, though. The phenomenal playing of Ashby, Carney, Jones, and the rest of the Orchestra keeps The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse firmly rooted in virtuosity, even when playing to new grooves, melded with African, Asian, and Australian rhythm and sound.On a personal note, this is one of my favorite CDs. Aside from the remarkable music, it gets bonus points for the spoken introduction, at the beginning of the "Chinoiserie" track. Audio notes give the listener a greater understanding of the CD, especially one with a single focus, like this one.
The first time ever I saw this group "Amici forever" as they were singing "Unchained melody", I have confused that song like classical music. Because, it was very familiar. Actually, I didn't know exactly what's that song that moment. Finally, I knew that song is popular music I used to sing. So, laughed myself.It was brilliant and great performance I ever heared before.I bought DVD, too. And I recommended my friend and he also felt their singing like me. He said great and thanks to me
This was the first Queen album that I ever had so getting it on CD is great.  "Sheer Heart Attack" is an overlooked Queen gem
This is a great collection of hits from the 70's. It is packed with hits. It is a great addition to a 70's hits collection
This is the first of Alison's album's that I bought, many years ago.....I've watched her career blossom.....she was an unknown when she recorded this album but in my opinon, it's her best!  True bluegrass, beautiful voice, wonderful music!  I've had the opportunity to see her and the band in concert several times and their music never leaves me disappointed
If you don't love this cd (and many people won't), then you must have a very different taste in music then me.  Yes, it's different.  Yes, it's offensive.  Yes, it's incredibly powerful.  Mutiny in Heaven is insanity on a disc, Six strings that drew the blood is awesome, as is everything on this disc.  Simply brilliant, and best disc to start a birthday party obsession with
I went through a painful final separation from the love of my life when this CD was released in 1997, and I identified with every song.  I listened to this CD over and over for several months.  I saw Kim at the House of Blues in Hollywood during that time and sang along to every song.  This CD is my favorite bitter sweet CD of all time.  I love you, Kim
Not as epically gorgeous as 'Once Upon a Time in America', but still lovely.  There's a South American influence that lends a very fresh sound to the entire soundtrack.  My favourite track is an Ave Maria--in Guarani.  Haunting.  However, "Gabriel's Oboe" is the theme that makes this score.  Being an oboist, it of course holds a particular appeal to me--and the oboe performing the theme is really something to be aspired to
dope Cd..Im a huge Spice 1 fan..this CD is off da hook...Check out immortilized and bossalini cds...those are dope quality Cds..I have over 600 hip hop Cds in my collection..and i don't really express my fealings on amazon unless its worth it..I love hip hop till da day i die...and Spice 1 is one dope smokin hip hop lyracist...tru dat...plus im from da old school..NWA, PE,Rakim,Boogie Down, Naughty by Nature(1rst CD),Big Daddy kane, Old School Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince, Old School LL...naw mean..wor
This is a great collection of the many "Atom Bomb" songs that are in movies such as "Atomic Cafe", Dr. Strangelove, and other films of the genre. I highly recommend this to anyone who collects "bomb" memorabilia
I absolutely loved the string music on Track 3.  I remembered it from an old PC RPG called Quest for Glory IV.  I was disappointed to find out that Track 4 was only a minute and a half long, because I grew up loving that song from the various places I heard it (Fantasia and a kid Detective PC game from the late 80's).  Overall, though, Grieg's greatest hits is a must-have for collectors of classical music.  Grieg is revered as Norway's greatest composer of all time and he certainly has a knack for creating imagery of bustling fjords and majestic mountainsides with interlaced river ravines. 
I love this CD! I often put it in my personal CD player and take it to the coffee shop to help me as I study French. The music is relaxing but not sleep-inducing. Steven Halpern composes great music
I got Secret Story as a Christmas present last year. I had asked for Imaginary Day, because the only tune I had heard from Pat Metheny was "The Roots of Coincidence," and I was itching for more. I still couldn't wait to hear what was on Secret Story, but I was hoping it would be in the same vain as The Roots of Coincidence. What I ended up hearing was an incredible CD with a vast scope, filled with emotions that change from tune to tune. Searching for tunes to sound like Roots was not successful; instead, I joyfully found a complete and very unique set.I agree with others that for maximum experience you should have enough time to listen to it in one sitting, straight through. The musical roller coaster is the most extravagant when done this way. I found myself trying to pick out favorite tunes, but I ended up picking ones for only a particular "mood" (such as an upbeat or sedative one). I could just as easily pick a few different tunes for another mood. That's why it's fun to listen to it straight through: no other album of mine gives me so much in so little time. Of course, Metheny has apparently mastered the flow of the tracks, too: one leads right into the next, creating, oh, maybe a "story?" I don't know the story, but it's a lot of fun to make up a different story each time you listen to it. I guess the tune that I most like to play, no matter what mood I'm in, is "Cathedral in a Suitcase," with it's mesmerizing 3-against-2 beat and a well-crafted three-chord progression that it revolves around. Tunes range from the euphoric (Cathedral, Finding and Believing, Facing West, The Truth Will Always Be), to the sweet (The Longest Summer, Sunlight, Always and Forever), to the smooth (Rain River, Antonia, As a Flower Blossoms, See the World), to the calm and reflective (Above the Treetops, Tell Her You Saw Me, Not to be Forgotten). Of course, this is all the tunes, and it makes for such a satisfying experience.Since this is my first Metheny CD, I am definitely going to pursue more. Metheny seems worth my time and money
King Elvis.Queen Madiona.Prince Justin.And now Princess Hillary!Duff is slowly making her way up to the queen of pop.It was espicially nice to here my teen idol singing all Christmas classics with some other pop stars too.If you LOVE Hillary Duff and you REALLY NEED some new CD's by her and it's Crhistmas time then this is CD for you!Let me tell ya somethin', that girl can sing.So go to the CD store.Buy it!Play it!Plop down on the couch and have a glass of egg nog.
I recommend this cd to anyone stuck in a rut like I was.  Listening to the same artists over and over but wanting something new and fresh.  Life on Planet Groove will be a welcome addition to your collection.  Great for the drive
For those of us who thought Phil Collins was to be lost in the mass pop culture, think again... that was back in the early 80s when I heard this.. it is mastery distille
Not only do you get some great music with this cd, you get the beginnings of Climax as well. (The last 2 cuts are essentially Sonny Geraci solo songs done by 1/2 of the band that would play on Climax records)Includes their 4 hits (Time Wont let me, Girl In Love, Respectable  Help Me Girl) and a slew of other VERY like-minded material. If you like any of their 4 hits, you will LOVE the rest. If you like Climax, you should buy this for the 2 last songs which are essentially Climax tunes
I got this disc for one song, the uncut, full length version of "Boogie Wonderland" by Earth, Wind and Fire (with the Emotions).  The rest of the disc is good - but "Boogie Wonderlan" is in a class by itself!!  Five stars!
I saw this band open for Placebo in Tampa, Fl. I had never heard of them before that night. I bought the CD immediately. Though it's a bit plain, It's a GREAT CD. It's a comforting kind of plain  It rocks. I played it in my cd player for about a month straight. The lead singers voice is unique. This band definitely has much potential to become a well known group. A great debut album. If you ever get to see them live DO IT! Their live show definitely makes the cd come alive.
Tears for Fears was not the average 80's pop band, even if they looked like it on the surfice. They used synthsizers, drum machines with a meliodic and hook laden sound. But the music itself was often melancholy and they brought up serious issues like family values like few contemporary bands at the time had the guts to sing about. Tears for Fears got their name from Arthur Janov's primal scream therapy and they band consisted of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith, two highschool friends from Bath, England. Roland was the writer of most songs during the career while they both were co-singing. Some of the music may sound a little dated today (this being released in 1983) but the touchy subjects they bring up are still present today. The opener and title track is a great pop song and at the same time a good introduction to what is coming, it's about children suffering without anyone noticing or caring. Tears for Fears trademark was mixing good pop with serious subjects and they really succeeded with that. "Mad World" was one of the big hits and recently covered by Gary Jules and taken back to the charts again as the sountrack for "Donnie Darko". The moody alternative song brings up the sad reality we're living in, a world without rules or morals and the people suffering from it. Excellent and haunting ballad. "Pale Shelter" was originally released in 1982 but failed to make it big on the charts, so the song was re-recorded, remixed and re-released and the result was a big hit even for "Pale Shelter". The song is slow paced and distinct with guitars, synthesizers and percussion. It brings up the lack of love some children get cause of bad parenthood. "Ideas As Opiates" is almost minimalistic, it basically only feauture percussion and slow piano sound, the lyrics are also sparse. "Memories Fade" is also a stripped and melancholy song, with it's haunting lyrics and saxophone it's one of this album's highlights. "Suffer Them Children" is a synth laden pop song about children with problems growing up cause they're ignored and not given too much love. Watch Me Bleed" got very strong lyrics "Heaven comes to he who waits/ But I know Im getting nowhere/ And all the deeds of yesterday/Have really helped to pave my way" and is overall another great pop/rock song. "Change" was one of three big hits on this album, it got a trademark marimba sound and a great hook which paved the way to the charts. The song is focusing on the destructive behavior of a loved one. "The Prisoner" is the darkest of songs with some very strong lyrics and arrangements suited for a horror film, the lyrics are sparse and they're almost whispered. The last song is called "Start of a Breakdown" feautures a catchy synthesizer sound and meliodic percussion. Why this song was not released as single is beyond me, but it's one of the best songs. This remastered version  feauture remixed of Pale Shelter", "Mad World" and "Change and the non-album song "The Way You Are" is present. It's another fantastic song by the way. Uptempo with great percussion arrangements. Nice it was added.Overall, Tears for Fears magnificient debut was one of the most daring and thoughtful albums of the 80's. It's equally intellegent and beautiful full of good lyrics and great arrangements. With this remastered version you get better sound + bonus tracks and the non album song "The Way You Are". Some of the songs may sounds a little dated today, considering all the new equipment used in today's music, but the lyrics and subjects they brought up are just as present in today's society. This album may get a little too personal and the lyrics get frightening when you listen closely to them at times, however if you're a music fan that likes smart lyrics and lyrics that make sense then this is something for you. It's a concept album and it very thoughtful and sincere. One of the greatest debuts of the 80's, let alone albums.
I caught Sonny in a live performance this past November, so I got to hear at least 3 tracks off of his most current album...Sonny Please.  He opened the set with a fiery "Sonny Please" which smoked for a good 15 minutes (I believe that Victor Lewis was on traps that night so the percussion section helped do the driving).  For a man approaching 77 years of age, I was impressed with not only Sonny's playing and gracious presence, but his stamina in performing two 40 - 50 minute sets...trust me, the man can still play!   This album may not be another "Saxophone Colossus" or "The Bridge", but it is a solid recording and should satisfy a majority of Sonny's fans.  If you have no recorded music by this jazz legend, this CD is a respectable starting point
The first cd from Baby Anne is fairly typical florida breaks fare. I wouldn't claim that's a bad thing, but don't expect to be surprised if you're familiar with the genre. Overall it's a solid offering from Baby Anne and delivers the bass.The second cd is a surprising mix from Jen Lasher, who has abandoned her old breakbeat sound and fully adopted a more electro feel. To those who have labeled this "industrial" I will say first and foremost that you are wrong. There is not one remotely industrial track on the cd. What she does provide is an extremely varied mix of synthpop, house, and a couple breaks tracks, all very vocal and sporting an electro pop flare, sometimes approaching the full-on ny electroclash sound. From someone quite familiar with electropop artists I can't recommend highly enough this diverse mix guaranteed to please newcomers and electro afficianados alike.My only complaint is the strikingly misplaced Wolfsheim track, which I can only assume fueled the misguided and completely false Depeche Mode comparison from another reviewer.
Darren Aronofsky's movies are beautiful masterpieces. From "Pi" to "The Fountain", going through "Requiem For a Dream", they will forever stand as timeless jewels. So they are hard to top in any way, but Clint Mansell has been able to do it every single time, scoring each of them.For "The Fountain", he teamed up once more with Kronos Quartet and had Scottish post-rock band Mogwai join in too, to produce a score that fits the movie like a glove, in a very organic way. The central theme to the movie is instrumented in a way that works fantastically well across all the time periods the movie encompasses.The combination of the talents of Mansell, the Quartet and Mogwai yields a relatively dark, yet breathtaking musical piece that will stand the test of time much like the movie it was meant to score
We really liked the CD of music from the sound track of the movie, Elf. It was what we expected and we appreciated getting it promptly since it is Christmas music and we we able to enjoy it all through the holiday season.  
This album has some of the best country songs in the business.  Mark sings songs straight from his heart.  There are songs for every occasion from the slow ballads like Too cold at home, I'll think of  something else, and Almost goodbye to the fast, heels  kicking Bubba shot the jukebox, and Going through the big  'd'.  These songs are about real life realtionships  and how they  affect the heart. So if you're in the mood to cry about that lost love or  smile now that they're gone this is the album for you
Another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of Lou Donaldson. The album released on Blues Notes features Lou's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones. Lou even opts to 'chill' out on a  number called 'Over The Rainbow' but on other numbers like 'Donkey Walk'  Lou's style and also his unique band really shine. The unmistakable hammond  adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and  swinging drums this brings together another great album.Keep on funkin Mr  Lou Donaldson!!!!
Do I mean the best album or the best singer?  You are correct if you said both!  I saw Kristin Chenoweth on a PBS show "Broadway's Best at the Pops," (though it was not the first time I had heard her) and decided to check out the offerings here.  This is a collection of the kind of music and performances I love.  She has a great range, a precise pitch, and a great style that is at the same time true to the music and to herself. In an era when singers try to outdo each other re-interpreting the composer's original work, not usually with great success, she is a blessing
I really enjoyed the song Kids in America by No Secrets.  Both of my children enjoyed it as well.  In fact I have been looking for their CD or for more information on them.  I thought they were cute, fresh, and brought a new touch to the song
The Best R Band Ever!!! I know some will disagree with me, but this is the band that really rock my boat. I mean, they were awesome and it wasn't forced or fake. The rawness of their funk is sooo addictive that you will never put this cd down. I am in the process of getting ALL their cds, but this one is a great way to be introduce to their music
Like it says in the ("33 1/3") liner notes: "...world class chops and originality".  If jazz is your bag and guitar licks get your attention, these tracks will set off fireworks!  My music collection started circa 1960, but these guys made it to the top of my list in a heartbeat!  If I could, I'd give it 10 stars
Hermann Baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd. I don't think that there is recording of the Haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance, even better than Tuckwell's. The cadenzas are absolutely awesome. I haven't listened to the Rosetti before but Baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well. Clevenger plays ok on the Haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy. I'm a saxophone player but I can recognize  true musicianship when I hear it and Baumann certainly is a brilliant musician. Highly recommended
This is one of the truly great Handel opera recordings of the last twenty years. As usual, Nicholas McGegan proves himself to be one of the two or three greatest Handelian conductors of our time. The singing from beginning to end is first class. This opera is known for the famous largo "Ombra mai fu," but the music in this entire performance is a sheer delight
Although a couple of reviews said this was a great product, I was wary as I have never found anything that actually worked.  I have a job where my mind is always on the go, and often have a week or two a month where I just can't get to sleep.The CD arrived during one of these times, I put it on my portable CD player not expecting too much, and almost imediately felt a bit queazy, nothing too bad, and on later research this basically proves the Delta wave theory Dr. Thompson is working.The only time in the past when I have gone to sleep so easily when I have been out partying all night when I was younger.  I play the CD on a stereo I have in my room, and I rarely wake up at all.I am certainly going to buy more of his CD's
While Photek was (and still is) reknowned for his minimalist approach to breakbeats and electronic sound, his approach changes significantly on Solaris. Starting off with the first three tracks, his beats still retain some of the stattacco nature of his earlier work (especially on Modus Operandi), but sound more full, more resonant. The tracks where he wanders into the realm of House were quite repeditive, and despite Robert Owen's wonderful efforts (first time I've heard him), they were lacking. The best track on the album, and one of the best Photek works is definitely Infinity. The rumbling bass really cuts right to the core, and reminds me a little of Source Direct. The trip-hop efforts are good for his first attempt at such music, but the more ethereal Halogen left an impression. A wash of sound that previously Parkes would be itching to rip apart with a snare roll, it comes off much better for the lack of any true form. Not a great album, but solid and indicative of where Photek would like to go in terms of his future works
Love.This.Album.  EVERY song is awesome!  This is the kind of album you play over and over because you feel great after listening to it. My favorites are "In A Moment" and "Know".  Half Past Forever rocks!
Link this CD of great melodies with  "The Best of The Browns (1954-1967).  You'll not regreat the quality.  Such easy listening.  This group is simply the best.  I also suggest reading Maxine Brown's book "Looking Back to See, A country Music Memoir."  It's a well written (and interesting) cover of the the history of The Browns
As a kid, Out Of The Blue was one of the first albums (actually, 8-track) I paid for.  That decision was made after hearing "Sweet Talking Woman" as a single, and after I bought it, the album grew and grew with me.  Every few weeks, a different set of songs stuck with me as memorable.  The first few weeks, it was "Sweet Talking Woman," "Turn To Stone," and "Mr. Blue Sky" (all pop perfection); the next few weeks, it was "Wild West Hero," "Across The Border," and "Jungle."  After three months, there wasn't a corner or edge of the album I didn't know and like.       Thirty years later, the remastered CD finally comes around and, through the fan club at [...](Which I heartily recommend because of their labors of love) I bought this and Balance Of Power (review coming).  I have to say I was a little scared to put this on again after all this time as my tastes of music have evolved and the label of "pretentious" has been placed on them by my 16 year old son ( a prog rocker, nonetheless).      A big sigh of relief--the CD holds the same joys it did before.  The Moog synthesizer riff by Jeff Lynne in "Turn To Stone" still pumps the heart, while "Sweet Talking Woman" and songs like "Wild West Hero" and "Jungle" still delight.  But I'm amazed at how things like the "Concerto For A Rainy Day" (four songs including "Mr. Blue Sky"--still the brightest jewel on this album) still hold together, and songs like "Stepping Out" and "Sweet Is the Night" step up to dig their hooks into you even today.    While the remastering is very good and makes some tunes step up ("Across The Border"'s horns beg you to crank them up), there are a few drop outs ("Night In The City" has a couple), and of course, my tastes probably don't translate to everyone.  But, my 16 years old has given the album a careful listen, and he hasn't returned it to me yet--I imagine for the next few weeks I'll still enjoy listening to "Out Of The Blue" from downstairs for a few more weeks..
The title track is one of the best country songs ever performed proving the talents of Hank as a true caftsman when it comes to song writing. Fitting that category as well are Outlaw Women, and Women I've Never Had. Hank also lends his southern rockin' style to White Lightnin' written by J.P. Richardson a.k.a. the big bopper.  What Bocephus album would be complete without at least one tribute to his father? Hank serves up a whopper here along with Waylon Jennings in a classic called The Conversation.  In a time, much like today, when country was straying from it's roots Hank finds a way to keep the southern bluesy traditions alive on all ten cuts of this must have country album
And he know's nothing about popular music and really should get back to work and stop sitting around convincing himself that he does.  Dumbass
people, what a killer release this is. i bought it in '92 when it was released, not knowing what to expect, as i had never heard a single cut from it. i knew Schonn was the axeman on this baby, and that was all i needed to know. i popped this cd in the player, and was instantly floored. what great melodic, poweful tunes filled my ears. i'm not much of a ballad fan, but even those are great. Dean Castronova on drums was the perfect choice for this type of release, as he adds the power to Schonn's precision. this is how Neal would have played with journey, had the suits let him do so. the Gioeli brothers, unknown to me at the time, do a masterful job as well. it's such a shame that great bands make an album or two, and just fade away, ie. Lynch Mob, Badlands and these guys, to name a few. this release is far superior to their second offering, but that one is pretty tasty as well. i suggest paying the coin for this cd, as it's worth every penny. Hardline 2 will run you about twice as much, but imports often do. get 'em both if ya' can, but this one is the best of the 2. peace.    
Being quite the fan of Grace Slick, Jefferson Airplane, and other 60s groups, I bought this album only having heard two songs on it--"Daydream Nightmare" and "Outlaw Blues".  At first I was a little puzzled--The Great Society sounded different than any band I'd ever heard before.  After listening to it about two more times, I realized this uniqueness was a good thing!  They sound a little rougher than your average 60s band, and they were--Grace, her first husband, and her brother-in-law assembled this band out of a few of their friends and it only was around for about a year.  The Great Society definitely isn't a band for everyone, but if you love interesting-sounding music, want to hear some of the earlier forms of psychedelic rock, or are just curious about how Grace Slick sounded before the *smoother* recordings of Jefferson Airplane, this is the band for you!  A quick review of all the songs:Sally Go 'Round the Roses: A great way to open this CD.  Pay special attention to the instrumental break in the middle--it's amazing!  (Any time this group does an instrumental solo, it will be VERY good.)Didn't Think So: In my opinion, one of the weaker songs on this album, but a fine song just the same.Grimly Forming: An overall fantastic song to listen to with intriguing lyrics and another great instrumental section.  (I love the tambourine--it adds an interesting air to the song.)Somebody To Love: Yes, here it is--the ORIGINAL version of the Jefferson Airplane hit, written by Darby Slick, Grace's brother-in-law.  This has a much less *psychedelic* sound than the JA version, but they're both equally as good.Father Bruce: This is a very catchy song written about Lenny Bruce as if he were a preacher.  Fun to sing along with.Outlaw Blues: This is a cover of a Bob Dylan song, I think.  Grace's voice on this is incredible.Often As I May: Another fun song that's almost as catchy as Father Bruce.Arbitration: This song is mostly some great instrumentals but features some singing from David Minor (he did rhythm guitar, I believe.)White Rabbit: Yup, another original version of a JA song!  This song's about 6:20 because there are 4 minutes of great guitar/sax playing at the beginning.  Almost better than the JA version!That's How It Is: A cheery song with fun words.  You'll definitely be singing this one aftewards.Darkly Smiling: This is another "weak link" on the CD.  (There aren't many, thankfully!)  It does have some interesting lyrics, though.Nature Boy: Grace's singing/recorder playing make this song memorable.You Can't Cry: This is a fun rock song, with the usual great guitar playing from Darby Slick.Daydream Nightmare: This is one of the more *psychedelic* and dark songs on the album, with great bass and guitar playing and more of Grace's recorder.  This is definitely not a song to skip over.Everybody Knows: Also a fun rock song, and yes, another catchy one.Born To Be Burned: This song is a little less exceptional, but it does have a good bass line, and some good guitar.Father: A FANTASTIC way to end the album!  This song is a nearly-seven minute long instrumental that builds up to an amazingly frantic crescendo.  Not a song that will keep you bored
I agree with most of the reviewers that this band was very underated.great singing electric and acoustic guitar playing and great songs.why were songs like Natures Way and I Got A Line not huge hits?I Got A Line made the top 40 I think.Natures Way was a great acoustic ballad.also Nothing To Hide has a nice acoustic/electric section.also Mister Skin could of been a hit catchy.this band was better than a lot of the crap that came out in the late 1960's all the bad hippie bands of that era.as for the whole album I think it would get  five stars if it had some live tracks as bonus cuts,like a live I Got A line or Natures Way live hearing that live would of been fun. I heard samples on a live Spirit cd.a great unknown band that everyone should give a listen to and to remember what real musicians and songs were about in the old days
Tunisian Anouar Brahem's "Le Voyage de Sahar" finds him in the same company- pianist Francis Courturier and accordionist Jean-Louis Martinier- as 2002's highly acclaimed "Le pas du chat noir."Having toured in support of that CD, the trio developed into a true group, something that Brahem accentuates to great effect on this program of new compositions and three favorites that are recast with the new ensemble.With "Voyage" Brahem continues a trend of creating music that is not as overtly "jazzy" as some of his earlier outings.Nonetheless, he remains a master a crafting deliciously vivid, richly evocative compositions that distill Arabic music and European jazz sensibilities with a warm, sonorous chamber music vibe.Among the ports of call on this "Voyage" are "Zarabanda," whose elegant lope recalls the French Riviera.Elsewhere the title track exudes mysticism tempered with intrigue, while "Cordoba" and "Ete Andalous" are meditative pieces with a decidedly cinematic scope.  The gentle bounce of "Nuba" and introspection of "Les Jardins de Ziryab" both include uncredited but effective passages of voice.Rarely do you hear music this gorgeous
I originally purchased this CD at a local store.  So many of my friends and family loved it that I ordered 4 more from Amazon at a fraction of the cost.  It is a superb CD and I recommend it to all. 
1990. It dosen't seem like that lond ago. When a barley known Mariah Carey stuns the world with a powerful 5 octave voice that hasen't been heard since Minnie Ripperton. She made her appearance when she signed on to Columbia Records after the now forgotten Brenda K. Starr, whom Mariah was a backup singer for at the time, gave Tommy Mottola a demo tape of her songs and the rest was history. Now about the album.The album starts off with her first single "Vision of Love" a powerful song that spent weeks atop the charts and made Mariah a star. You can feel the suspence as Mariah builds up to the bridge and gives the world their first hearing of her beautiful 5 octave voice. Truly to this day, still one of her best songs."There's Got To Be Away" changes pace from love to world issues that are still relevent today. This was released as a single in the U.K. (it wasn't released in the U.S. for fear that it would break her string of four number one hits) yet it failed to chart."Someday" is the next song and was the albums third single. It too hit number one in 1991. This song is great to hear after a breakup as Mariah warns an ex-lover that "the one you gave away will be the only one your looking for." This song may seem a little out dated now as it still has some heavy 80's synth beats."I Don't Want To Cry" was the albums fourth and, in the U.S., the last release. It too hit number one in the summer of 1991 and within a year Mariah had a whopping four number one hits under her belt. Something that will not be accomplished for a long, long time. Though Mariah has declared her hatred for the song as she fought over the production of the song and was dissatisfied with the final product, the song still has all the work of a great Mariah song and it is the only song that Mariah does not hit her famous whistle register with."Vanishing", though never becoming a single, is probably one of the best Mariah recordings. A gospel like song with amazing vocals over a pounding piano is enough to make anyone think their in heaven. Though the song is spookey enough at the chorus when she softly coos "swiftly you're vanishing, drifting away." It has also been called a "hidden treasure" by many reviewers."All in Your Mind" is another song that realy showcase Mariah's vocal capabilities. Though this is one of the few songs that sound dated, but definatly worth a listen."Alone in Love" is a song that is soft and pleading would make anyone run back to Mariah. Truley a Mariah great.The next two songs,"You Need Me" and "Sent Up From Above," really are the weakest tracks on the album and do bring down the feel of the album. They also sound dated and are not the style in which Mariah is famous for. Still, every Mariah song is worth a listen, so go for it!"Prisoner" is a truley a great Mariah tune. Though this has a rock influence as well, she does a great job with the vocals and the lyrics stay insode your head. This almost became a single in the U.S. but Mariah finished her new album quicker than originaly planned."Love Takes Time" truly will have a place in my heart. Every time I hear this song it takes me back to 1990, almost like a little time machine. Putting this song on her first record almost didn't happen, as Mariah har intended it to be on her next record. Though Tommy Mottola and other executives persuaded her to. The style is not that different than "Vision of Love," where it build untill the brige where Mariah lets off her signature high note. This was also the second single of the album and became her second number one in late 1990.Though Music Box, Daydream, and The Emancipation of Mimi would go onto break records and are considered some of Mariah's best albums, there is no way you can leave this one out. This album truley is the one that started it all. To this date it has gone 9X platinum and made Carey into a star and would be the start of years and years of great music from THE voice of this generation. Though this album was heavily criticized for being to similar and formulaic to Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson, and especially Whitney Houston, it still ranks as one of the best albums of the 90's and of all time. For some people this album may be a time capsule of 1990 and for others who are now expiriencing this music for the first time one fact will always be true. This is one of the best debuts and albums ever and was the start of a simple Long Island girl named Mariah Carey, who became a superstar.
This was one of the first Hiphop albums I ever purchased and I still listen to it today I think that krs's style was best suited to Primos production. Once he lost Primo (with the exception of a few albums) he couldnt hold it anymore musicly. krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack MCs that deserved it. This was also the album that introduced the world to krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his BDP days as well as few musical/lyrical tricks up his sleeve This album along with any other BDP release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters out there who are just getting into Hiphop this was the era that I belive Hiphop was the best about 93-98 its a shame that kris is doing the crap hes doing now I wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a live battle rapper.  
This truly is a masterpiece of pop music. There is not a wasted moment. The songs all blend together majestically one after the other. You really must listen from beginning to end to get the full effect. I agree with the reviewer that stated that 'Don't Look Back' is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I told a colleague that my heart melts when it plays. I don't mean to be gushing but this album stands apart. I had to put it away for awhile because it is somewhat addictive.
Gerry Beckley is "timeless". His new CD is awesome and seems to go back to his roots. His songs over the years last lifetimes and bring back amazing memories.This new CD just proves he hasnt lost his touch. Anyone who does not agree, doesnt know the real Gerry. I have had the privilege to meet him and talk with him many times, including being able to celebrate New Years eve with them after a concert with the rest of America and their families.He is one of the nicest people i have ever met, and his songs have always been a part of my life. I hope there are still many more CD's still to come and look forward to seeing him again in the near future in concert and afterwards
THIS IS A CD THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE! THERE ARE FOUR GREAT VOICES AND THEY DO COUNTRY MUSIC THE WAY IT SHOULD BE! LORRIE MORGAN IS THE BEST AND I LIKE EVERYTHING ON THIS!! BUY IT AND ENJOY! CHERY
If you like the Beach Boys and appreciate the technical quality behind Telarc recordings, then this disc is a must have in your collection. First, Papa Doo Run Run does an excellent job covering Beach Boys tunes to the point where some people can't tell the difference, but you can still hear the uniqueness they bring to it. Second, you'll feel like your hearing parts of the music you've never heard before because there is so much more foundation and clarity to the recording. You can hear each instrument clearly. The beginning of I Get Around is almost explosive, they way the original recording should have been. Telarc and Papa Doo Run Run have made a special album here. When I feel like listening to the Beach Boys, I usually grab this CD first
I assume you already know what's on this recording or you wouldn't be here, right?  Don't you probably have a thirty-year-or-so old vinyl copy of this that you haven't listened to for years because it's dusty and has scratches and pops and who listens to that stuff anymore anyway?  Well, I won't review the music here because others have done better than I would, but I will say that listening to this remaster through a high quality set of headphones (Sennheiser) has enabled me to hear this as if it were the first time.   It's totally worth the money to get this new version, and the bonus tracks just make it even more fun. 
Joe Bonamassa is a blue/rock musical phenomenon that is awe-inspiring to anyone who will take the time to listen to his music. In his musical style/class, I would count him the second greatest musician on the planet - with Walter Trout weighing in first place.  As you can easily see from all of the other reviews, I believe that you will find this CD well worth purchasing - as I have found all his material is. (After purchasing this item, I eventually went on to purchase everything he produced and haven't been disappointed.) As with any CD, you may not like all the selections but I believe the vast majority of his material you will. Among my favorites on this CD are: `Pack It Up', `You Upset Me Baby', and `Man of Many Words'. Bonamassa is an extraordinary adept and versatile musician. Since he is young and gifted, we can expect many more superb CD's in the future. Highly recommended
Does anyone know whether this set will become available on SACD or DVD Audio format?  How would you contact GRP records to ask? I only give it four stars until multichannel format appears.
Together with  'THE BEST OF KOOLTHE GANG'.....    T H I S is the ULTIMATE  bit of funk that i've found so far.  The tracks may not always have a song structure (and for me the women singers may be omitted..)  -  the funkiest bits in history are found here!!!!!!
In August 1969 five session singers were invited to form a new session group. Main singer was Tony Burrows of Ivy League and Flowerpot Men fame. The first success came with the second single United We Stand. This CD  collects together the three US hits of the session group plus the only US  hit of the group that was the face of the session group in concert during  1971-1973 and that would become the second outfit of the group, the  Eurovision winning song Save Your Kisses For Me. The rest of the songs are  a mix of songs from this second outfit 1974-1980. This outfit is still on  tour at the end of the centur
First off, to the above comments, while I thoroughly enjoyed your well articulated history lessons, and would be interested to read other history lessons from you, you have to realize that this story is not directly based off of the 300 Spartans at Thermopolye, but of the Graphic Novel. Now this is not to say that it is historily accurate in some sense, but the movie is tuned more to the direction of the graphic novell itself.**** Caution SPOILER ALERT *****Besides that the Soundtrack is amazing and it is always a Joy to listen to a soundtrack that really captivates the real emotion of that particular scene, I especially enjoyed the music when they fight the "beasts" and it is really hard rock, and I especially LOVED the ending music when the entire Spartan Army is gathered and the one spartan is telling them to remember Leonidas (It is called Remember Us on the Soundtrack).May we all find our own "Glorius Death
"The Essential Jimmie Rodgers" is highly recommended for any serious country music fan. If anyone is the genuine article, it is Jimmie. Listeners will recognize some old favorites among the tracks including "Frankie and Johnny", "Mule Skinner Blues" and "T for Texas".  There are also fine versions of "Waitin' for A Train" and "In the Jailhouse Now" though some may prefer Jerry Lee Lewis' version of the former and the Webb Pierce recording of the latter. The most interesting tracks are less well known.  These include "My Old Pal", "My Old Sunny South by the Sea" and one devoted not to a mother but a father (!)-"Daddy and Home". For this reviewer, the album hit its high point on the final track, a mournful "TB Blues", a reference to the disease that took Jimmie's life at 35. While Jimmie's yodeling style may not be for everyone, this reviewer considers this album a safe bet.  Keep in mind that JR was elected to both the Country and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Further, the "Essential" series of albums rarely disappoints. These almost always sponsor well- produced compilations of our past heroes best efforts. "The Essential Jimmie Rodgers" certainly falls into that category
I have to tell you Lionel Hampton has yet to be matched in talent, and drive on the "phones." Funny Story, it was Tito Puente the late and legendary " King of the Mambo" was the one who showed Lionel (by carefull persuation) the light of the "phones" and shuned him away from the piano. Unfortunatly not much was known on this subject of the two meeting but I believe they meet in the service or right after Tito was discharged for WW II. I can tell you Lionel, to me, is best know for His BIG version of "Flying Home". A bigger, badder version of the small groups version he did with Benny Goodman, and teddy wilson. Lionels closest match would have to be Red Narrvo form the 1930's, but still Mr. Hampton 's drive and moves on the stage has yet to be matched
For someone who knows little about Bach and wants to learn something, you couldn't do better than to give them this CD.  Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra give their signature warm, plush sound to the work of the great Johann Sebastian Bach, making him sound very nearly like a Romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer.  This is not a bad thing--some complain that Bach, with his mathematical leanings, leaves them cold.  That isn't possible with the inviting material on this CD
This is one of his older CDs, but one of my favorites.  The music is smooth and wonderful to listen to.  Great CD after a long day or to play on a special night
I have to say I was getting worried that John Adams was becoming a has-been.  El Nino's first half was much better than the second, I didn't particularly like Transmigration and I defy anyone to listen to his 2001 piano work American Berserk and tell me it's any good.  But after this release, I stand humbly corrected -- he's still, in my opinion, America's, if not the world's, best living composer.Dharma at Big Sur is scored for an electric violin and orchestra and uses a tuning system that's not well-tempered.  What really makes this work special is the way the electric violinist plays soulfully and beautifully above the orchestra for almost the entire work in a sliding style I've never heard before in classical music.  The first movement "A New Day" with its quiet and contemplative opening really feels like it's the creation of an entire universe.  The climax of the second movement might be the most satisfying conclusion to any of Adams's works to date.  Dharma is an absolute masterpiece.My Father Knew Charles Ives is wonderful too, even if it's not as powerful or moving as Dharma.  The work is both an homage to Ives and a reflection of Adams' life.  Clearly, Adams had a great childhood.  The first movement, Concord, is playful -- the clearest tribute to Ives, since it's sounds structurarlly similar to his Fourth of July.  The chaos in Adams' Concord is a little more rigid than Ives', but it's still fun.  The second movement, "The Lake", features a beautiful clarinet line that evokes the composer's father.  The scurrying of the last movement, "The Mountain", seems needlessly frenetic at times, but the cathartic ending that results of it makes the voyage worth it.My one bone to pick is with Nonesuch.  The two works together represent about 52 minutes worth of music -- an amount that many would already consider stingy on a single CD, especially when other works like Guide to Strange Places go unrecorded.  So why put these two works on 2 CDs?  Is it to justify the $20 sticker price?  An artistic statement to completely separate the two works?  It just seems silly.  But it's also forming a nasty pattern of sub-30 minute CDs that really should stop.  People want to hear the astonishing sound world that Adams creates -- why try to limit it to 25 minutes at a time?Buy this disc, even if it's split into 2 pieces.  It's the best of his works yet
I love almost all of these songs on this cd. If you want songs that grab your every emotion...this cd is for you! I also recommend their other cds also
Ace rolls out its second volume of early girl and girl-led group sounds.  This time, there are six tunes that did not make it into the top 100 and that may seem to be a bit of a letdown in content but when looking at the overall repertoire, this series still beats just about anything else of the genre out there.  With enough (ten) top-10 songs to keep the music familiar, there are lots of seldom-found sides making the listening much more interesting and not sounding like every other oldies comp.  Between such monster hits as Lesley Gore's pre-womens' rights anthem You Don't Own Me, the Exciters go-and-get-him Tell Him and Kathy Young's barely pubescent A Thousand Stars are cradled such rarities as the Secrets' The Boy Next Door (a Madara-White, of You Don't Own Me and other Gore tunes fame, composition ), April Stevens' Teach Me Tiger (later with brother Nino Tempo striking it big with Deep Purple) and Timi Yuro's (of Hurt fame) What's A Matter Baby.  In this volume three of the tracks are acknowledged as having been lifted from disc but only track 10 is of substandard sound quality even so.  Many of the tracks (2,3,6,8,12-15,17,23,25,28) appear in stereo, the remainder in mono.  The 16-page booklet accompaning the disc provides pages of fascinating backround to the artists represented.  Ace again hits the mark with this new compilation
Undoubtedly, Marnie belongs to the top list of Bernard Herrmann's best film scores, a wonderful musical image of Alfred Hitchcock's underrated movie. Written for small ensemble (strings, woods, harp and horns) Herrmann gives the music a wonderfully flowing mood, tasteful and delighted along with the dark characteristics in every second bar that Herrmann so masterful handles in all his works for Hitch. Joel McNeely's reading is simply stunning as ever, so is the performance, but I just don't like the overall acoustics on these Varse rerecordings with the large hall reverb giving the orchestra no room for details. They simply are overheard in this muffled sound. This is far from ideal for recording a film score and I bet Herrmann would not have liked this! But, it's a great, great score
I am new to Ron Sexsmith. Where have I been? This Cd is outstanding and so soothing.... The instrumentals are soul syrup, the melodies are whipped cream and the lyrics are full of cherries, nuts and fudge sauce.....It is putting something so sweet and so nurturing into the hearts and minds of the hungry and starving. I am still in the stage where his songs resonate in my mind just before I fall asleep at night and that waking up means I get to hear his "comfort food" again.... This honeymoon will last forever....  Fall in love folks, it's worth the risk....Calorie free, I promise...Thanks Ron, God Speed !
I am realtively new to country music. I purchased this because I had the pleasure of hearing Willie sing "You Don't Know Me" on CMT one afternoon. I was quite taken with his rendition and recalled hearing this song growing up. From this one time "soft rocker" I couldn't be happier. Go Willie
This will be short.  It is worth the price of this album just to hear the Branford and Harry Connick Jr. duet Carolina Shout.  That being said, all of the other tracks on this album are excellent. From Jungle Blues to Doug Wamble's solo guitar on Autumn Lamp, with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for Romare Breaden's art.  A must have.  Branford keeps outdoing himself
Ice Cube is back for his 6th solo with the Peace Disc.  This may be my favorite album from Cube (close with "Lethal Injection").  His lyrics are much different then his first few albums and the beats changed with tthe times but it's still nice to hear from Cube.  With 13 songs, none ar ebad, 5 are ok, 1 is almost a classic and the rest are good.  Guests are on 4 songs so you still get enough Cube to satisfy you.  Production is decent as well, Chuckey Thompson  One Eye each do 3 songs, Puff Daddy, Younglord, Bud'da, Battlecat, Dr. Dre, T-Bone and Charley Bear all do 1 song.  A must have album for fans of Ice Cube.#1 - 8.5 (f/ MC Ren  Dr. Dre -- N.W.A. reunion)#3 - 8.5#4 - 8.5 (f/ Jayo Felony, Gangsta from the Comrads and Squeek Ru)#5 - 7.5 (1 minute intro before he raps)#7 - 8.5 (nice beat)#8 - 9.5 (f/ Krayzie Bone -- nice beat)#9 - 7.5 (f/ Mack 10  Ms. Toi -- also on the "Next Friday" soundtrack)#11 - 8.5 (nice beat)#12 - 7#13 - 7#15 - 7.5#16 - 8 (good beat)#17 - 8O'Shea Jackson -- b. 6/15/69check all my review
Nas' Street's Disciple definitely has plenty of memorable/outstanding cuts on it. Nas sounds very confident and his lyrical skill is prevelant throughout both discs. The subject matter varies which is way cool in that, it delivers to all audiences of his fans. Every Nas fan will be doing themselves a huge favor by supportin him and pickin this up today. A
I hesitated for so long to get this.  Having followed Moby's rise since circa 1994 it has been amazing to watch what an impact he has had on music and on various cultural media over the years.  I like his early techno/rave stuff and have enjoyed the gift he has for using electronica to score some beautiful and haunting hymns.  But I wondered: has Moby gone soft?  has he sold out?  I was pleasantly surprised.Look at the cover and add rain.  That's the overall mood of this album.  I find rain to be cleansing on many levels, often building a mood of pensiveness, reflection and a fragile peacefulness.  There is a glorious melancholy in the music, the lyrics and the singing on the album.  Take the chilled out moments from Moby's other albums and build on it.  That's what he's done here.Almost every song has singing - primarily Moby's longing, almost cyring, voice - and almost every song is for those rainy nights, when the world doesn't make sense, when longing for companionship and understanding burdens the heart, yet with a subtle hope underneath it all.  It's downtempo, mellow, moody and sometimes sad.  But it is beautiful.  Don't expect "old" Moby, don't look for the commercial jingles of Play.  Just put it on and listen
"Animal Farm" is a personal favorite of mine. And I dont understand why this song does't get more recognition - in my opinion, the most underrated song ever written (yes i know, its a bold statement). Theres something about Davies' voice in "Animal Farm" that makes this song unforgettable - particularly in this part:'While I lay my head upon my pillowLittle girl, come play beneath my windowThough she's far from homeShe is free from harmAnd she need not fearShe is by my sideAnd the sky is wideSo let the sun shine bright' The build up to Davies screaming "She is by my side" is really breathtaking. The title track and "Starstruck" are just as excellent. This album is a real treat and should be in everybody's collection
...yes, the Beatles by which I'm not comparing Supergrass to them. No, Supergrass are riding the road built by not only The Beatles, but other British rock'n'roll greats like The Kinks, David Bowie, The Zombies and many others. But the exploding energy of Supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000's. This will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of British rock'n'roll of the 1990's and 2000's, and without doubt represent the Bohemia-Intellectual-Hard Rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since Circa-Sgt. Pepper. An intoxicating and highly addictive album. 100% recommended for anyone any age.
When I bought this cd I did not know that much about supergrass.  The only songs I had even heard were "pumping on the stereo" and "sun hits the sky" and I liked both of these songs a lot.  So while I was cruising the aisles in the record shop, my eyes caught a glimpse of Supergrass is 10, so I decided to buy it because it was at a great price, and I am glad I did.  The CD has not left my car since I bought it two months ago.Every single one of the songs can get stuck in your head, and you won'tbe upset.  From the opening track "caught by the fuzz" to the finale "Wait for the sun" the album just rock throughout, and everytime I listen to it I want more.  The album clocks in at 71 minutes, but everytime I am done listenintg to it I feel unfulfilled.  That is a sign of a band making great music
I had first bought the "Here and Now" hoping to hear the original recordings, but was slightly disappointed that on that CD the older songs were live performances only. If you want their hits as you remember hearing them on the radio or your old album that may be trashed, this is the CD for you
This is the best CD I have ever listened to! I highly recommend i
To start off i am a huge grateful dead fan and i have prabably about 150 cd's that cover many years of there carrer.  This release is very good and worth buying.  it has some great music on it and the price of the album is worth the eyes of the world with Branford Marsalis on the sax alone.  All and all this was among my first bunch of grateful dead cd's that i got and it got me hooked so do yourself a favor if you are thinking about listening to the grateful dead and you want to hear something from the 1990 era buy this cd.  But i would also get something from the 77 era too
Buy this CD now if you don't have it, it is an instant classic. The beats are banging, and fit Cougnut and C-Fresh's lyrics perfectly. The lyrics are tight, and touch on many different things. The Last Breath is real life song about death and injustice, and decisions we all have to make in life. Protect What You Hustle Fo is gangsta, about the individual struggle/hustle. Tell Me Something Good (remix) is even better than the West Coast Bad Boyz version with Master P. Its about real life in the ghetto
This Mos Def album is a good album to listen to.  He shows off his lyrical skills and gives social commentary that is on point.  Why listen to a bunch of guys who have "lil"  in front of their names when you can listen to a man give his views on life, love, and this country we live i
Plain and simple...Cage is one of the best Underground rappers around.....And soon after Hell's Winter drops I think he will be accepted into mainstream......This CD is Cage at his craziest, the beats are hott, the rhymes are hot...BUY THIS CD....and if you like this CD buy some of his other CDs, Weatherproof, Night Hawks, Smut Peddler's : porn Again, The Leak Brothers: Water World, and Hell's Winter
 While nothing in the film works very well except perhaps the chemistry  between Travolta and Stowe, the sublime soundtrack is another story. Descriptions such as "haunting" and  "soul moving" are right on the money,  one might also add ineffable to the list.
The Clean kick-started the illustrious New Zealand label Flying Nun in 1981, providing a key blueprint for indie-rockers from Australia (the Chills) to California (Pavement). Over this two-disc, 46-track set of rarities and essentials, the trio takes the chugga-chugga racket of the Velvet Underground and stretches it into an entire garage aesthetic of excited, rudimentary playing, shaky, Kiwi-accented vocals and endearing melodies. Disc one, as influential for the lo-fi sonics as for the songs, ends with the Clean's 1983 breakup. Disc two spans their 1988 reunion and 1996's Unknown Country, mining similar material with even more exciting (and even better-sounding) results. But by then, lots of bands were doing what the mighty Clean had helped pioneer.
Stick to singing in Spanish, Shak
Vet producer Don Was is aboard for this one and he pushes the Ladies to write some of their most mature material, relying on their trademark humour as a flavoring rather than a sole ingredient. The result is that even the radio tailored material is better than on "Stunt".Best tracks here are: lovers sparring in "Too Little Too Late", twangy "Go Home" (possibly the only time you'll hear a country tune with glockenspiel. Parental warning: this is one you'll want to skip if young ears are in the car because of a gratuitous F-bomb at the coda..), the tale of a co-worker dalliance in "Conventioneers" that ends with them feeling awkward about it ("So I wait, come in late, It'd be great if you transferred out of state"), the cheater finally caught in "Humour of the Situation" ("Have you heard the one about the boy who moved into the henhouse to sleep? He woke up with egg on his face, When he found that all the hens had crossed the street") and the ethereal "Tonight is the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel", which utilizes an almost Disneyish melody in its tale of a man in a traffic accident who, disembodied, surveys his own demise ("In all the confusion, there's something serene, I'm just a posthumous part of the scene").The least interesting tracks are "Off the Hook", another cheater gets him comeuppance tune and "Baby Seat", a gentle nudge to accept responsibility instead of wanting others to look after you.  Bottom Line: While not as consistently fabulous as "Gordon", this one hits on all cylinders more than it misses and it utilizes more of the band's talents by allowing more lead vocals from Ed Robertson ("Pinch Me","Falling for the First Time"), as well as Kevin's first on the hidden track "Hidden Sun". You also hear the Ladies do things they haven't before: Steven's flute on "Tonight's the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel", Tyler's 808 drums for "Off the Hook", and a dash of retro courtesy of Ed's wah-wah pedal on "Conventioneers" and Kevin's vocoder on "Humour of the Situation"
This is one of those rare CDs that you'll leave in your car CD player for months and not get tired of, because it fits most moods. Feels like Melissa Etheridge meets Cheryl Crow, with an old blues feel here and there, and some nice, heavy Tori Amos-like piano and vocals here and there too
The Rosary is very well produced. A powerful tool to crush the devils head
This cd is so awesome, It stays in my cd player and I have recently added it to my MP3.
Just loved this CD!!!!  You'll be singing or humming this to yourself for hours after you hear it.  If you are 35 years old or older you'll LOVE it.  The memories will come flooding back to you.  Enjoy it!!
What a wonderful and diverse CD.  Sit in front of a fire on a rainy day with a nice glass of Oregon Pinot Noir in your hand.  Close your eyes relax and let the sounds of Liebert surround you.  His talent is evident in the expressions as he's playing.  The guitar seems an extension of his own form, not a separate instrument. 
Spice 1's just different from every other rapper. And he's awesome. If you love hardcore rap, you'll love Spice 1
This album is essentially a fusion of great musical minds.  The legendary Khan payes more attention to making this a better experience for the western audiences of the Sufi music by playing more with his (brilliant) vocal skills then with the lyrics.  Micheal Brooks' music stands out and enhances the experience further.  This is not to say that the mainstream Indo-Paki audience won't enjoy this album ( This is one of my all time favs).  It is fabulous background listening while doing work which may need focus - for those who need music to do such things... :) For those who have been thinking of testing out Sufi music, this is the place to start.  This is a fine introduction to the great NFAK and Sufi music. 
Despite the excellent screenplay by Sam Shepherd and the solid acting by Harry Dean Stanton, I found "Paris, Texas" a rather unimpressive film, and the only thing that kept it together for me was Cooder's astounding soundtrack. The music here is simple, yet very moving and even haunting. His guitar stylings really captured the mood and feel that the film was otherwise supposed to convey. It seems to seep right out of the desolate landscape of the Southwest. Every time I listen to this CD it reminds me of driving along some deserted highway in Nevada, SE California, etc. Also, it's really nice that the soundtrack contains the story ("I Knew These People") told by Stanton's character, since to me that was the best part of the movie. Even so, seeing "Paris, Texas" is not a prerequisite for enjoying this CD, the music is phenomenal in its own right
The first four albums are so unbelievably great that for me it's almost impossible to say one is better that the others. Taken together, they are almost like one long album. The Family That Plays Together shows the band turning a slightly more commercial corner without sacraficing any of their artistic integrity. Their blending of styles is a bit mote intergrated than on the first. Randy California's influence on the music was becoming stronger as well. One thing that differd Spirit from most of their comtempories was the strength with whch they were able to convey their songs in concert. I saw the original version 11 times and they never failed to astound me. It's a shame that the only legitimate live recordings of the band are of the later Ed Cassidy/Randy California version. Not that the later versions of the band weren't great - they just weren't quite as good as the original band. If your'e just being introduced to Spirit, The Family That Plays Together is a fine place to start
Eloy (name taken from H G Well`s Time Machine) is a German Atmospheric, Progressive Art Rock band that was formed back in 1969. Through the years, personal wise, the band has totally turned over, in some positions, several times. Their originator Frank Bornemann (guitars/vocals) has persevered, presiding over a three decade band, that has turned out some of the best progressive rock music, I've had the fortune to hear.OCEANOcean, their sixth album, released in 1977, is a concept album, depicting the rise and fall of Atlantis. Though there are only four tracks, they average almost eleven minutes each. Many Eloy aficionados point to this album as their `tour de force'. It is excellent, but as far as I'm concerned , based on what I've heard so far, there is no album that stands heads above the others.Overall, Ocean has an atmospheric ambience reminiscent of Hawkwind or a more unknown band that I once reviewed named Ship of Fools. It also reminds me Jeff Wayne's, War of the Worlds.Track listing1. Poseidon's Creation (11:38) **** Has a long droning medium pace and a whinny guitar intro. At the 4:40 mark, Bornemann finally begins the vocal. There is quite a lot of guitar playing on this song, augmented occasionally by the synth.2. Incarnation Of The Logos (8:25) **** Has an atmospheric vocal beginning. The song doesn't seem to have much of a melody until the 3:40 mark when the synth/organ takes over with a pleasant one, assisted by some percussion and a bell now and then.3. Decay Of The Logos (8:15) *** The shortest song at eight minutes seems a little jerky at first with more monologue than music. When it does get going after about three minutes it's still jerky in a medium paced beat. Strong synth playing through the middle.4. Atlantis' Agony At June 5th - 8498, 13 p.m. Gregorian Earthtime (15:35) *****This is a monster song. It is like nothing I've ever heard. Except for a fifty some second monologue at the beginning, "Atlantis..." starts with a truly intriguing eight minute plus instrumental intro. Not just any intro, like you're used to, with a full orchestra and violins. No this is an spacey atmospheric intro that would make the great Pink Floyd, envious, with the propitious use of ghostly sounds and special effects segueing into an amazing five minute organ bridge, with no beat just the Hammond a few side effects and you. No it doesn't get boring. Instead it sets you up for the vocals, which issue forth at about the eight minute mark. Slowly the rhythm section establishes a slow beat, while the singer does a great imitation of Bob Dylan, with a remarkable spacey synth breaking in between the vocal. But we're not done. With about two minutes left, the band picks up the tempo to a medium fast tempo (the first time I`ve heard them play at this speed). Now the violins join in with the guitar and synth for the finale of this great finale.Total Time: 43:53Line-up- Frank Bornemann / guitars, vocals- Klaus-Peter Matziol / basses, vocals- Jrgen Rosenthal / drums, percussion, flute- Detlev Schmidtchen / keyboards, mellotron, xylophone, voice- The Boys Of Santiago / chorus (1)CONCLUSIONOne of the factors, I find appealing about this band, is that in the span of three decades, they managed to present a style of music which was compatible with each era, so listening to their albums from different periods gives us a window into the progressive music of various time periods. Eloy's musical tempo almost never exceeds medium and on Ocean tends to be more in the medium slow range.Listening to this and other Eloy albums I hear influences from numerous other bands. Like many prog bands I hear Pink Floyd but I also hear Uriah Heep, Moody Blues and Bob Dylan (really, on track four!)
Very good piece of music history. I still like the LP's sound a bit better then CD's due to some of the characteristic noise flaws but unfortunately LP's do not play in the car.
I remember hearing of this band when I was just a lad, but I never owned any of their albums, and none of my closest friends played this for me, so this is a great discovery for me. I'm only on my second listen, but it's already obvious to me that this is going to become a favorite. It's from my favorite rock period, the early seventies, and it's not only nicely remastered, it's also remixed, meaning they went back to the original multi-tracks, not the stereo master. I wish more reissues were done this way
Really enjoyed hearing all of them again. There is some great talent on here. I hope they all get their own opportunities! I do think in some cases there are some better songs to show off these great singers voices.
If you want to learn about Texas music just buy this disc.  Tom's love of life and artist's eye infect every song.The opening number "Tonight We Ride" is hard to beat.  He sang it on David Letterman's show (Paul Shaffer played the accordian!).  Letterman described it as a "song that will make you want to saddle up a horse, ride up to Connecticut and rob a liquor store." Me, I just went out and bought some good Reposado Gold. Letterman's got a point, though- the songs on this disc will move you one way or the other.  My other favorites are Bucking Horse Moon, and All This Way for a Short Ride.  Tom Russell is true American artist like Woody Guthrie or Pete Seeger, and this is one of his best.
IF YOU LIKE BEATLES, MONKEES AND THE WHO, THEN YOU WILL LIKE THE GROUP THAT IS BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM ; THE RASCALS ! "LONELY TOO LONG" IS A SAD ROCK POP PAINFUL STAPLE IN YOUR 60'S ELBOW...IT HURTS...THEN THERES ALL THIS OTHER GOOD SH*** HERE...AND I DON'T MEAN GROOVIN ! THE HARMONYS AND THE KILLER KEYBOARDS AND TIGHT DRUMMING IN THESE LITTLE POP ANGRY YET CHEERFUL NUGGETS IS WHERE ITS AT !...I CAN REMEMBER LISTENING TO THE RASCALS INTERMITENTLY WITH BLACK SABBATH AND THE STOOGES...AND I REALISED THAT ABOVE ALL...I LIKED MY RASCALS RECORD THE MOST BACK IN 1987 UP IN THAT COLD LONELY BEL AIR GARDENING CABODE ! ALSO KNOWN AT TIMES AS 'THE YOUNG RASCALS' BUT TO ME...THIS BAND WILL ALWAYS BE THE ONE FROM WAY BACK IN CHILDHOOD THAT GOT ME LISTENING TO QUEEN AND THE WHO LATER ON........ITS HARD TO SAY THAT THEY ARE UNDERRATED SINCE IN ANY GIVEN CONVERSATION, YOU REALISE THE RASCALS GET TONE OF RESPECT AND PEOPLE WILL TAKE OVER AND TALK ABOUT THEM ; FIVE STARS...BUY THIS THING 
Fluke's latest album had been long in coming, and plagued with issues (word on the grapevine is one of the trend-setting trio left some point during production).  Still, years after their masterpiece Risotto, Fluke has returned intact and delivered another album, the oddly titled Puppy.Puppy is for the most part a dark album.  It's clearly the evolution of the track Absurd (off Risotto) and its particular taste of big beat techno, with numerous tracks featuring similarly styled lyrics and vocals.  The sound has been expanded with touches of industrial guitars and beats that would sound right at home in Prodigy's Fat Of The Land or at a Nine Inch Nails concert.  The opening Snapshot shows this most evidently.  The album takes up a rave feel with the tracks Another Kind Of Blues (a remix of the stellar number Zion featured in The Matrix Reloaded and its soundtrack) and Hang Tough, which flow into each other and result in a mesh of old-school rave beats with new-school industrial grooves.  YKK is a wicked track that would easily be at home in a big-budget spy or action flick, while Expo is a sweeping and epic song.  Blue Sky is as close to an uplifting number you'll find on the CD, with a full choir used in the song's chorus.Compared to Risotto, Puppy inevitably comes up short.  Like BT's Emotional Technology, Puppy has the misfortune of being the follow-up album to a complete and utter masterpiece (Puppy to Risotto, Emotional Technology to Movement In Still Life).  And let's face it: it's hard to surpass yourself when release an album that's nigh-perfect.  Still, I wasn't sure what to expect with Puppy and I found myself pleasantly surprised.  It's darker and meaner, but it's an overall rock-solid album, and fans of the grittier side of Fluke (Absurd, Atom Bomb) will likely be pleased with Puppy
I recently decided to go through some of my old cds that I haven't listened toin ages. Dj Cheb i Sabbah's Maha Maya: Shri Durga Remixed was one of those cds that I came upon. This was my first exposure to Indian music, let alone world music. I wasn't really familiar with music outside of western culture. So this was a new experience for me. Listening to Maha Maya Shri Durga Remixed certainly takes the listener on a trip to India with its traditional Indian melodies. I envisioned myself in the Taj Mahal and watching a slew of belly dancers performing. The music took me awhile for the melodies to grow on me. It is certainly by no means your traditional dance remix album. I however dug Transglobal Underground's version of Kese Kese (Where's the Sarangi Mix right from the get go. It has a nice beat. Dj Cheb i Sabbah did a good job at mixing and making sure that the music flowed well together. I am definitely curious to hear dj Cheb's other cds now that I have re-discovered this little gem of a cd
Hey there all, want to listen to some great songs by a country  artist, Chely Wright, then go ahead and purchase this CD you will be amazed at the talent Chely has. songs spanning from her ealier days to her current hits, a great collection for the diehard fan, and a great gift for those who have not been able to experience the very TALENTED Chely Wright
This mix starts off heavy, and never lets up, with the quirky, yet hard hitting vocal track Grace (Anxiety) by Troy Pierce (as Louderbach) starting things off in a very energetic way.  This track worked well in Sascha Funke's Boogy Bytes 2 mix, but it was deep into the mix.  I feel it's even more effective starting a mix off.  Things quickly lighten up with the bloopy Claude VonStroke next, and then it's into the M.A.N.D.Y. remix of Tiefschwarz's excellent track Damage, featuring Tracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl on vocals.Two solid tech house tracks follow, especially Touane's snappy track Bassic, and it's right into the gritty, churning, techno sound of Thomas Schumacher's incredible track Rotor.  The mix then hits a very slight snag in track 7, which I feel is one of only two so-so parts of the mix.  It's not bad, it's just a little too light and bubbly tech house for my liking.  It's quickly forgotten as the mix races through with 4 solid tracks in a row, and right after the melodic Freefall, it's into Tiefschwarz's own remix of a Depeche Mode track.  This is the only other slight miss in the mix for me, as I feel the track was a tad too long at nearly 7 minutes, and could have been trimmed to better fit the flow of the mix.  Another solid melodic track is next, and we end with the dubbed out vocals of Kate Wax.Overall, it's an exciting tech house mix that's a full lineup of solid tracks, with not a bad one in sight, and very few dips in the scorching pace of one, very sound, top to bottom mix.  Do not miss picking this one up, as it's easily in the top 5 techno/tech house mixes this year
How dare you compare Oasis to Phil Collins. Phil Collins sucks and Oasis rules! How come you don't get the message? You're retarded
As much as I hear time and again that "Mindcrime" was the Seattle quintet's finest, I always have to argue that this 1986 gem is the pinnacle of their career. While I was a big fan of Mindcrime and it's predecessor "The Warning", Rage For Order is QR's most consistent release and is mezmerising from start to finish. In a word.."perfect".So few bands can boast having made a perfect album. I can think only of The Beatles (Sgt. Pepper  Revolver to name a few), Pink Floyd (The Wall, Dark Side), Dream Theater (Images  Awake), and Boston (Debut). Rage is an album to be listened to and appreciated. Released in the hey-day of "hair metal", this album has not one single song that lends itself to the tag. None of the songs, while very image provoking, could be easily made into an MTV hit. Although "Gonna Get Close To You" aired on MTV (rarely I might add) it didn't even scratch the surface of this album's potential. Overall, the performances of each member outshine anything before, or since. DeGarmo and Wilton trade licks masterfully. Rockenfield and Jackson keep a very tight bottom end. Tate...well...Tate was THE metal singer at that time and this was his finest performance.While the mix was somewhat lacking, the production was incredible. Each song blends into each other perfectly. This was metal that was unique and completely original. I think the term "thinking man's metal" was coined at the time. That said, I can think of no other release at the time to which that term could be applied. Unlike most of their metal contemporaries at the time, Rage was athmospheric, intellectual, and surreal. Rage succeeded where Priest's "Turbo" failed abysmally. It was a stark vision of the future and the metal was more futuristic than we'd ever heard before. It was like listening to a whole new machine. It still holds it's own 20 year later, seeming as fresh and "now" as anything in progressive metal.
"Debut" is used to describe someone's first release.   Not their third.A Classic, 5 Stars...PMG in an exciting, formative mode
This CD was beautifully sung by the Cambridge Singers, a boys/mens choir, mostly a' capela.  It's the first Christmas CD I've bought that really tempts me to crank up the volume so I can revel in every note
This album / CD rocks! Can't stop playing it! Nuff said
this is what music is all about, the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note, or the raspy, delicious vibrato of vocalist David Sylvian; it makes me melt and feel so good and pure. think if Tweaker were to make jazz--and really chill out--this is what it would sound like. you'll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet, ever. there is everything one could want. possibly the perfect record. it's jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul.absolutely brilliant and definitely essential.  one of my favorites from the year.
If you like late 60s British rock-psych, tough-not-fey production/vibe, white-soulful vox, and mixing electric/acoustic elements (think: a cross among BEATLES + ZOMBIES + TRAFFIC + SMALL FACES, even a lil' BYRDS feel occasionally), you shimply MUSHT try ROLLED GOLD, which compares to the cream of these groups' output!! -"the Ac-WHO-"!? you might well say...'Where have they been all our life?'; 'A gem beyond price has languished all these years unsavored,' we repeat nearly speechless. Not since our belated introductions to Moondog...Skip Bifferty...Billy Nicholls...Stones' "Metamorphosis"...Dantalian's Vehicule...It can easily be yours.We very rarely care to replay any c.d. over and over but this one warrants such: well-crafted blend of nonchalance poetry and passion, delicacy and yarbles, hooks and chops and pacing and SONGS up there with the legends. The news that this cohesive album was only DEMO'S* ('haps fortuitous in retrovision) catapults one's estimation higher still.Singer Reg King: on ROLLED'S strength his visage deserves a spot on some Rushmore-in-Avalon alongside fellow soulful Brits Winwood/ Marriott/ Reid/ Lloyd/ Stewart...: just hoarse enough/just sweet enough (+ a 'secret': optimal use throughout of unison doubletracking)...perfection. ROLLED GOLD'S production is on the raw/monoish/hotly-compressed side-- a flute/piano occasionally to augment the basic guitar quartet formula  keep things unexpected-- suiting the songs  performances to a Tee (just to offer another clue to their magic brew).Homey's in no way related to any bandmember..
I'm not sure what took me so long to get it, but I'm just coming across this album.  It never made a blip on my radar I guess.  Anyway, I saw it at a local record store in the used bin for $2.00 and it was hardly used -- even the jewel case was flawless (it looked like it was only played once and then taken back to the store).  Obviously the owner before me didn't know what they had on their hands and the store manager didn't know either due to it's low price tag.  Balance is a must have album without question.  It came out in '03, I'm just getting it here in late '05 and it still sounds fresh.  There are so many bangers on this album that listing them would make this a five paragraph review.  Of the 16 joints (including the bonus track), I'd have to say that 14 of them are amazing.  Akrobatik rhymes with an honesty and realism that is rarely heard in rap (even amongst underground emcees).  The songs compliment and play off of each other without them all sounding the same.  I did mention that there were two songs that I could've done without.  Those songs are "Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and "Always Bet On Ak".  They aren't bad, but I find myself skipping them everytime I play this CD.Balance is a must have LP.  I still feel a bit cheated since I just found out about this album.  There has to be some sort of promotion for this guy.  I did get the Black Dialogue (Perceptionists) album and I knew about The Lost Adats and The EP, but somehow I completely missed this one.  Don't be like me, if you haven't heard this yet, grab it as soon as you can.  You won't regret it.  This is one of the best albums on 2003.  Highly reccomended.Standout Tracks: Time, Woman II, Remind My Soul, Balance, Hypocrite, Limelight, Front Days, Here  Now, Wreck Dem feat. Mr. Lif, Cooler Heads, Feedback feat. Diamond D, and Bone Crushe
A great series concept - highly significant artists performing material which taken individually or collectively represents a major section of the  American Music Library. Ofcourse the originally withdrawn [w. new  at-the-time Funky people] Talkin' Loud.. by JB (I bought it  retail! ) is the highlight, along with the live  It's My  Thing... by Marva Whitney. (Yes, I saw MW sing it **l-i-v-e** at  Madison Square Garden in July, 1969). The prev. unrel. Bobby Byrd track and  Vicki Anderson's contribution to the Cold Sweat session also  reinforce the value for listeners
In 1976, MY FAIR LADY returned to Broadway, in a revival touted as the "20th Anniversary" production.  Perhaps most famously, this particular revival was the first big professional splash of a young soprano called Christine Andreas...  At long last, this much sought-after cast album gets its CD premiere.  Christine Andreas is one of the best Eliza's ever captured on disc, and Ian Richardson's performance as beleaguered tutor Higgins is full of wit and humour.  George Rose (in a Tony-winning turn as Eliza's dustman father) is very enjoyable in his main numbers "With a Little Bit of Luck" and "Get Me to the Church on Time".  Jerry Lanning also makes for a fine Freddy, with the winsome "On the Street Where You Live". This recording also features the "Embassy Waltz" sequence, which was never included on the OBC, and only featured as a bonus track on the reissue of the OLC.The production itself heavily recreated the original production, complete with Oliver Smith's sets and Cecil Beaton's costumes.  Hanya Holm's choreography was revived thanks to original dance captain Crandall Diehl.  Christine Andreas picked up a Theatre World Award for her breakthrough performance.  The show opened at the St. James Theatre on March 25th 1976, but later moved to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre where it closed the following year after 377 performances.  The following year, Andreas returned to Broadway in another important revival, the 1978 production of "Oklahoma!" in which she made a thrilling Laurey (cast album available on RCA); before cememting her position as Broadway's ingenue of choice, with the role of Frankie Frayne in the 1983 revival of "On Your Toes" (cast album available on Jay/TER).  More recently, she played Marguerite St. Just, in the original company of Frank Wildhorn's flawed "Scarlet Pimpernel" (cast album available on Atlantic).I heartily recommend this particular MY FAIR LADY
.and SO worth the price of admission.  6 CDs worth to be exact.   Coleman's musical voice is so free and full of life!  It really is beautiful
I discovered this album some years ago as i'm workin' in big music stores i've got the opportunity to listen to so much music....well!! this album is a very difficoult one to find in a record store nowdays, and every time i have it in stock i play it straight away and some customer who listen to it buy it instantly,Blakey and Potato are swingin' so much in those salsa like rithms Mobley is -as usual with Art Blakey and K.D.- in such a great shape givin' a wonderfull touch to evry note he plays,basically one of greatest Blue Note of all time!
This is by far one of the most beautiful recordings made by the Bill Evans trio. This was I'm told  Bill's first all ballads record. Riverside records released it on vinyl way back in 1962.  None of the music sounds dated. considering it's 41 years old. This is the first recording Bill made with Chuck Israels taking over for the late Scott Lafaro as the bass player. This album has a very haunting and romantic feeling to it. The music is sad in tone and suggests feelings of longing and sobering reflection. One goal that Bill always strived for was to ballance intellect with passion to make intelligent and  original sounding jazz. I dont even know if jazz is the right stamp to put on this recording. To me it sounds more like European classical music. Also thank god for Bill's college music theory teacher at Southeastern University Gretchen Magee.  Because if it werent for her motivation {Evans often thought of his work as unsatisfactory and sometimes needed alot of motivation from from bandmates and peers} he might not have composed his gorgeous original composition "Very Early" {which is the last track on the CD its just breathtaking...}Being an amature pianist myself, "Very early" and "childrens play song" were the first two Evans' compositions I taught myself to play. The piece is a composition played in C major at a slow waltz tempo. He played the tune until the end of his life in 1980, but the original version on "moonbeams" might be the all around finest one.  It is given a very slow and delicate treatment, and when he restates the theme at the end you can almost feel an imagrey of leaves or snow  falling gently around you. I also really like his interpretation of "It might as well be spring". I think that Bill Evans was a beautiful person and pianist because he was never flashy and this album proves that. He didnt play anything he didnt have to. He always played just the right amount of  notes and chords. With this record it all comes together coherently to make a truly stunning musical statement. Evans once told Tony Bennet to forget everything else and just concentrate on "truth and beauty." With the album "moonbeams" fans of Evans' music and important legacy will clearly be able to hear his own truth and beauty about life glowing from this gorgeous album. Highly recommended
sounding thing occurred when ex-Springfield Messina melded with Loggins,and it was LARGE!C.S.N.Y. strove to be this good every time they released a tune. This compilation not only displays the music-crafting  abilities of these two in conjunction,but also showcases their power to  deliver dynamic LIVE performances. dedicated to Todd j
A top quality recording with all of Artie Shaw's favorites.  Artie's music as fresh today as when it was recorded - with the power and appeal that hits you right between the eyes
The opening song "Cups" by the Salt Lake City Orchestra was one of the first songs I downloaded on my ipod.  It is such a great mix!  I just love it!Oh yeah... and the rest of the CDs aren't bad either...  ;-)                       
Leo Kottke is a national treasure.  He is our greatest living solo acoustic guitar virtuoso.  Having said that, you'd expect his CDs to be at a very high level of brilliance.  I have at least a dozen of his titles.  If there is any trouble in deciding the merits of any one disc, it's because there are so many Kottke releases to choose from."One Guitar, No Vocals" clearly ranks as one of the best.  The compositions tickle my brain, warm my heart, and put a bounce into my step.  The guitar playing is dazzling.  You really get a glimpse of the man behind the guitar by listening to this music - brilliant, thoughtful, odd, complex, quirky, a huge heart, and the wackiest sense of humor.  It's spirited music, so thoroughly drenched in the personality of its creator that it's unmistakably and immediately recognizable as Leo.  The world is full of acoustic guitar instrumentalists these days.  Some of them are quite excellent.  Many are not.  But there is only one Leo Kottke.  And his guitar music is a gift to the world.A very strong recommendation for this CD
I saw her perform most of these songs on Austin City Limits. I must admit I hadn't paid much attention to her since her debut album, back when I was playing in country bands.Much of this material is kinda introspective, but hey, on the plus side you get great vocals, well crafted songs, tons of sincerity and just flat out integrity from this great artist who doesn't have to pretend she is anything she isn't. And these days, that is pretty refreshing!I think I am becoming a fan
And finding stories of stacks of old vinyls, dripping Yesterday and glowing Always.  Cali's finest, Madlib, is definitely one of the heirs of DJ Premiere, Pete Rock, DJ Quik and other previous beat konductas that helped established the sound of true hip-hop as a platform where old school soul and new school technique are amalgamated.  The latest Madlib Invasion is not for everybody; those of us who's butts were undeniably moved by Tribe's "Low End Theory" will definitely appreciate this endeavor.  Those of you who are tired of what MTV and other corporate entities and pass off as hip hop, clean out your crazy Uncle Otis's attic check out the Beat Konducta. Then walk down the street to Mr. Yancey's house, go into his basement and check out J Dilla's "Donuts.
It's a testament to the noncomformity of the era that XTC's quirky debut album had the band initially lumped in with the late 70's first wave of British punk rock. Those were different times, after all. You couldn't find a teen punk these days who could make head nor tails out of the herky-jerky, spastic wit of White Music. Come to think of it, not many people could make much sense of it back then, either. Andy Partridge's elastic vocals refused to clearly enunciate any words with more syllables than pop, and Barry Andrews' keyboards were more an attempt to interrupt rather than complement each song. Nevertheless, the album worked. It rocked in its own art-damaged way, and fearlessly toyed with the sacred relics of the previous generation. That lone strum of a single chord at the beginning of the Fab Four's Hard Day's Night was cleverly appropriated for the intro to This Is Pop. A few songs later Dylan's All Along the Watchtower got twisted into ominous goofball paranoia. There may have been more intense punk artifacts from the Class of '78, but not many were anywhere near as smart as White Music
Jeff Beck is the best guitarist on the planet and has been for a very long time.What you get here is an abbreviated version of him live.His song selection is not the best, but Freeway Jam which is one of my all time favorite Beck songs is included.You also ger Scatterbrain and Blue Wind.She's a Woman the old Beatles song is also included.Jeff Beck at this time was playing some of his best guitar and his solo instrumental career was taking off.The songs with the Jan Hammer Group to me are very average and infact distract what Beck is trying to to.Unfortunately this is his only Live album from his instrumental era. I truely wish he would release a DVD of himself in concert for those who either havent seen him live or would like to see him live on DVD.The idea was good, the Cd is too short and not up to snuff
This is one of his best cd's. You really have to listen to the words on the cd, he takes you to  whole another level. He is one of the best r singers ever, just close your eyes and listen to the song "maybe" and think of that special place for you and your lady
Europe and Japan - the final great pop frontiers ! ....last I heard it was Austin ?  - OH WELL ! Canada shows love too...our favorite neighbors....do ya a favor ! There are some really interesting Japanese based labels...search on web and be impressed !
I have listened to this wonderful soundtrack and I think it is superb!! I now know that the ALIEN movies rock! The tone of the music fits the movie. I especially like  Ripleys Them Because it reflects on what has  happened with Ripley through-out the movie. The cloning, learing,  remebering and also meeting her clones. I would also like to say that the  movie was  excellent aswell. The cast did a great job, acting their hearts  out.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet should be proud of the music and his film.So if  you aren't an Alien fan, you sure as heck will be after you listen to the  soundtracks!               ~   Jenna  
Its a pretty good mix, good song choices, its mostly a harder mix, thought it could be smoother flowing though, but all in all its pretty good, also thought the robot walk to the party deal woulda made a better begining, it was a lot of down time during the middle of the cd, but hey people gotta switch it up now and then, like the last 3/4s better...
Hard, smart, creative funk can be a hard pursuit in life these days.  Even with the age of the reissue firmly upon us, finding a decently accessible funk album can be a real biyatch.Thankfully, "Secrets," under the usually readily available  Columbia jazz header is probably just sitting there in your jazz section pleading with you to pick it up for $9.99.  Should this be a hard decision? Emphatically: No.Although I can see where previous reviewers are coming from, trying to compare this outing to Headhunters is truly unnecessary.  With this '76 effort Herbs is definitely toeing the fine line between jazz, funk and disco but it all works.  "Doin It" is a super, super heavy funk jam and sounds like it was culled from the "Man-Child" sessions.  And although "Gentle Thoughts" can be interpreted as a dated sound it probably stands as my favorite rip on the album.  It's got a great walking bassline and super funky breakdown and, as always,  Herbie dancing on the keys. Go get "Secrets," don't think about it.  It'll always be an easy go-to funk bomb just when you need a little infusion
For hard-driving well-crafted rock-and-roll from the late 70s/early 80s, you can't do much better than Pat Benatar (and Heart) and this collection carries most -- but not all -- of the singles that dominated the airwaves for 4 years: Heart Breaker, Hit me With Your Best Shot, Love is a Battlefield, Fire and Ice, Promises in the Dark.  But no Benatar collection is complete without 'Treat Me Right', 'You Better Run', and 'I Want a Lover who won't drive me crazy' (superior, in my opinion, to the John Mellencamp version), especially if you prefer Benatar's hard-driving rockers to her slower ballads.   Nevertheless, 'Best Shots' is a great place to start and certainly - at $10-15 versus $50 for the more complete 'All Fired Up' --  the best value for the money.  
I was thrilled to see this available on CD .......... it is the most delightful Christmas 'album' of it's time  IT CONTINUES TO DELIGHT!  I purchased several and gave to friends for Christmas - every single receipient was immediately thrilled to have this 'album' on CD stating, 'this was my favorite, where'd you find it?"  Great gift
Throb was my introduction to jazz back in '69 or '70.  I havelistened to it all of these years on LP then CD, and it neverlost its charm.  Steve Swallow was just as nutty then as he is now, "Chickens" is my favorite cut.  The play between electricviolinist Richard Greene and guitarist Jerry Hahn is a thing ofbeauty. Hahn is still a player who can put just the right notein just the right place (like that other countrified genius ofjazz Bill Frisell), he can fuzz and wah-wah then tinkle thestrings just right to make his musical point.  One interestingthing is the organ playing by Burton on Throb, besides his vibes. The Jarrett-Burton album also has Hahn and Swallow, and drummerBill Goodwin --It is very much an album that shows all the newideas sprouting in music.  Fortunately, the ideas of that timedid not die out, but have continued to grow, making room for allsorts of fusions in Jazz, many of which have been remarkable toexperience. These two-LPs-in-one is like having a Superstaralbum before they became superstars.  As I said before, Istill play this CD after almost 35 years, and I still get a kickout of it, and still find things that amaze me
Which I suppose I'm not allowed to say, what with the worldwide phenomenon that was Songs From the Big Chair. But I think it's right. Roland took the opportunity following the breakup with Curt to make an aggressively postmodern record, and return to the steely-eyed austerity that the lyrics on The Hurting always suggested.  Indeed, this album is continually proving to be ahead of its time; as a previous reviewer noted, "Goodnight Song" has what has since become a familiar AOR sound. I call it the first "Coldplay" song, and it's fair to suggest that band would never exist without Tears For Fears.Roland also finally nails the pacing of an album here. On Songs and Seeds, 8 tracks was not enough to allow for a full dynamic arc, a sense of opening, progression, and completion; the 10 songs here have room to breathe, vary significantly between each other and finally close satisfyingly with "Goodnight".As both Roland and Curt have matured, they have also mellowed. The anger they felt at the world and towards each other seems to be gone. And their latest album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, has none of the dge that made their older stuff so energizing. But CDs don't age, so pick this sucker up. It really doesn't get much better
I have both the Heat and Seduction CD's by Oscar Lopez and listen to both of them with wonder.  This man is magic.  I have about 20 new flaminco CD's and these are right at the top as  far as my tastes are concerned.  Oscar, if you're listening, I check at  least once a month for your next one
The Animals, a group that included Eric Burdon and Alan Price, were the first major pop stars to emerge from Newcastle, a city located about 300 miles north of London, therefore far removed from where most talent scouts were searching. It is fortunate for us all that the Animals were discovered because they recorded some of the best R+B music to come of the UK in the sixties. Their biggest hit was House of the rising sun, a re-working of a folk song (apparently inspired by Josh White's version of the song) that gave them a transatlantic number one hit. They had five other top ten UK hits with Mickie Most, these being I'm crying, Don't let me be misunderstood (a cover of a Nina Simone song), Bring it on home to me (a Sam Cooke cover), We gotta get out of this place (the version included here is the UK version - a markedly different recording was released in America but was unavailable for inclusion in this set) and It's my life.Apart from their singles, the Animals recorded many other covers including Boom boom, Dimples, I'm mad again (all John Lee Hooker), Around and around, Memphis Tennessee, How you've changed (all Chuck Berry), I'm in love again, I've been around (both Fats Domino), Talking about you, Hallelujah I love her so and I believe to my soul (all Ray Charles). These covers clearly demonstrate what their main influences were, but they also wrote some of their own songs.All the music I've mentioned so far and much more can be found on this excellent compilation. Nevertheless, despite the title of the compilation, it isn't actually their complete recordings - there is a sub-text explaining that these are the complete recordings that they made with Mickie Most as producer, although the liner notes describe their whole career. After the split, they switched to another record label, where they had some success using the name Eric Burdon and the Animals, including two more UK top ten hits (Don't bring me down, San Franciscan nights) and several lesser hits, all of which can be found elsewhere (search for Eric Burdon). Alan Price left the group before the split with Mickie Most and had several hits as a solo singer. These are also outside the scope of this collection but are easy to find.This complete collection (apart from the American version of We've got to get out of this place) of the first and most important part of the Animals' career may be more than some people want - there are single CD collections available if you just want the hits - but if, like me, you like to explore beyond the hits, this is for you
When this first was released I really wasn't expecting much. The last two releases Mega-Dave put out Risk, and the World Needs a Hero excluding the live Rude Awakening while certainly had some moments were 3 out of 5 material, but in defense they had to do what they to do to stay around. However, this album from the up tempo Blackmail the Universe, Kick the Chair which could have been on Rust In Peace, the Scorpion another return to form, and Back in the Day definitely were a few of the many highlights of this album. I wouldn't put this up there with Rust In Peace or Countdown, but I certainly would put this up there with So Far So Good or Youthansia actually this album kind of takes elements from those albums, and put's it into one. If your a new fan and just getting into Megadeth this isn't a bad place to start. Certainly a must have, and am looking forward to the brand new album next year. Long Live Mega-Dave
Other than that this is a proper introduction to the Heavster
Quite different from his later big-band recordings. Some of the songs that you may find on Wes' 'BEST OF' collections sound too much like elevator music. Not so with this debut album. A drummer, a organist, and a guitar player; no horn section. Stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing. He shows of his trade mark octave playing, his chord solos (played over the organs rythm chords none the less), and flashy runs across the fret board when needed. A good CD to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz.
This is the latest entry in the lost legend series and it is the best alblum since the very first lost legends alblum release. The songs match up and compliment each other better than any of the previous alblums in this series, so well that it sounds like a dance alblum. I give it a high recommendation for any surf music fan. Try alldirect.com for the best prices on this series of alblums
My personal favorite dashboard cd.  Every other one of their cds have maybe a few good songs that I like, but the places you have come to fear the most has pretty much a solid tack lis
Five stars may be excessive if you judge this CD alongside the greatest classics, but when compared to similar CDs within the singer-songwriter folk-rock genre, this beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines.  I find myself coming back to this CD more often than to many better-known classics because it has a freshness and originality that sustain interest.  The writing, while occasionally a bit awkward, is consistently interesting, honest and moving.  The themes of introspection, nostalgia,  regret, and defiance are presented in a searingly personal manner.  The song "If I Were a Man" is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to relationships and the world; "Child of Steel" plucks the heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy; and "Take my Body" is a strong lament about the objectification of women.  I especially love the pared-down guitar arrangements; the simplicity really works with Ms. Cash's strong vocals and makes me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally just get back to basic guitar accompaniments.  I've seen Ms. Cash perform live and, while she has other hits that may be more popular, this collection reveals her unique brilliance
Even though Mitchell wanted to feel reckless in this album, she accomplished one thing with her music: coming closer to Weather Report.  It's obvious she loved its jazz-fusion and admired Jaco Pastorious and Wayne Shorter so much to have invited them to reach their peaks, but as master musicians they could only achieved what Joni allowed them to do. In "Paprika Plains" (a song over 16 min. long) Joni unloads wonderful lyrics but only allows her group of pioneers to explode at the last two and half minutes. I would have hoped to hear a longer and more robust instrumental finish worthy of Weather Report's reputation.  Over all the album is interesting because Mitchell is not afraid of going out on a very tiny limb....
The Soundtrack is great but some of the good songs from the movie arent on it.  Overall it is a good produc
Yeah, Johnny must've been drinking heavily during this recording. It's evident in his slurred lyrics...It's Raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted, although you can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed. BUT  all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of this c.d.---- Johnny Winter really becomes the archetypal BLUESMAN on this c.d.  His guitar work is quite sparse, no long solos on this one but, nevertheless, the feel on this album is wonderful.   I have to say this also..Johnny must've been VERY, VERY brave to release this album back in 1977. That was a very bad year for the blues, appalling infact...disco music was king. Alot of bluesmen, like Johnny Guitar Watson etc were opting for the commercialism of the disco dance floor. Johnny might've thought of releasing a commercial type rock album , like Edgar was doing. Instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and I have to admire the determination and resolve of Johnny Winter. Very few would've stayed faithful to the blues. The last track with Muddy Waters ..Walking Thru The Park...captures Johnny in his element. He was SO happy back then and it filters over into the song itself. I remember seeing them both do this song live at the Capitol Radio Festival, Alexander Palace, London/England in July 1977. Never again to be repeated, sadly
I really like this cd a lot and I am looking forward to seeing them live
I prefer the live versions of these pieces. Its nice to get more material from that period but you can hear the strain that was going on at the time of this final album by this line-up. I was at the concert for live record and think that they (the pieces that are on this CD) really come alive when being performed live
OK (I imagine there's still drool over my earlier review...and my wife is none too pleased either...) TRUTH OR DARE time! I bought this CD out of none-too-scientifical curiousity, that, and Let Me Blow Ya Mind - and guess what?  I'm beginnin' to dig the entire CD.  As I mentioned, 99  44/100th% of rap music fully explains to me what Gregg Allman meant when he sang, It's not my cross to bear. OK, that being said, Eve pulls no punches (although the skits on the thing about wet myself laughing), and she's not a lady whom'd I'd like to cross.  But I bought the ticket, so I'm gonna take th' ride.  And enjoy myself mightily while doing so..
A friend of mine at work just recently introduced me to the music of Chris Rea via this very nice Best Of comp. He also recommended getting his Road To Hell cd. Both of these cd's were money well spent. I'm surprised that this artist flew by my radar screen in the 80's when he was at the peak of his songwriting and popularity, mainly due to his top 20 hit "Fool (If You Think It's Over)". For some reason I never equated that song with this artist. The thing I like most about Rea is his musical diversity. He can lay down a very memorable AM pop hit like "Fool" or "Let's Dance" and then turn around and make a great blues rock album like "Road To Hell". No matter what the genre of music, this artist is very good at laying down a nice groove. There's plenty of catchy tunes to be found throughout this cd. "Auberge" and especially the wonderful "On The Beach" stuck out for me. But you get many styles here. And each song sets a different mood. From the easy listening "Winter Song" or the catchy "Looking For Summer". Or some excellent blues rock like "Road To Hell", "God's Great Banana Skin" or the excellent instrumental hidden track at the end of the cd that shows off Rea's tasty slide guitar skills. I don't know how I missed this artist after all of these years. But I'm a new Rea fan who now looks forward to his next album. Whatever style that it might be, I'm betting it will have some versatile playing and some very well composed melodies like this superb Best Of. This is a nice place to start listening to this fine artist. If your like me, after hearing this cd you'll probably want to search out some of his individual albums. I've since picked up his late 80's album "Dancing With Strangers". Another very nice cd. Most of the music on this Best Of cd is almost 20 years old, but it feels like it could have been written today. In other words it's well composed music that holds up very well over time. And I'm sure if your like me and not familiar with Rea's music, the minute you hear "Fool" or "On The Beach" it's going to bring the good part of the 80's back to you. Greatest hits cd's should all be this good. Highly recommended
This record is a must from the middle of the 50's .Excellent singer , very good musicians and an excellent recording .This record is still amazing and seems to sound very modern due to the quality of the recording and the mastering.I recommend this record to all rock and roll fan
Ummm if you buy it you will know I borrowed it from a friend and he never  got it back...so I bought him another
I pretty much agree with EJ Rupert, but the good songs on this soundtrack are so strong that they make this album damn near classic all by themselves.  I gave this album 4 stars for that very reason.  Though it was never released as a single, "My Block" is one of Tupac's best songs (pre death row era is the best 'Pac in my opinion).  I don't think there's any question that every rap music fanatic recognizes Red and Meth's "How High" as an unquestionable classic (and this is the grimy version of How High....not the fluffy remix).  I still get open to that beat 11 years later.  Though it is somewhat formulaic, "Poppa Luv It" is still a dope cut from LL Cool J.  Bone Thugs N Harmony, Mary J. Blige, and  Onyx contribute "Everyday Thang", "Everday It Rains", and "Live!!" which show each artist in vintage form in my humble opinion.  Also, "Sowhatyousayin'" is the ideal west coast gangsta track in my mind.  Even when you get past those great tracks, you have other bangers like "Kill Dem All" [Kali Ranks], "Glamour  Glitz" [A Tribe Called Quest], and "Still Can't Fade It" [Warren G.] that still make for a great listening experience.  Hell, even The Dove Shack blew up on the strength of "Summertime In The LBC".  And the live version of Biggie's "Me  My B*tch" is definitely different from the studio version and it's great.  There's plenty to love about this album.I also agree that there are too many filler tracks.  "What's Up Star", "Ol' Skool", "Domino's In The House" and "Zoom Zooms  Wam Wam" all fall under the filler category.  Actually, the filler tracks are the only things wrong on this album and I'd say that only 10% of the album is filler.  The rest is bangin'.The Show Soundtrack is definitely a worthwhile pick up for any hip hop fan.  There are bangers on this album that make it a must own.  If you were into hip hop around the time this came out, you remember when half of these songs were played for the first time.  There are definitely some classic tracks on this album.  I highly recommend it.Also, for those of you that want more artists represented, check out the "Rhyme  Reason" soundtrack (which is pretty much similar to this, but with better collabos).  You'll find a lot of artists there too.Standout Tracks: Poppa Luv It, My Block, Live!!!, Kill Dem All, Summertime In The LBC, How High (My Favorite), Everyday Thang, Everyday It Rains, and Me  My B*tch [Live
This is an awesome EP Slayer owns all even when the production isn't that great. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman shred fast as hell with their blazing fast riffs, Tom Araya's vocals are very hellish and gruesome and Dave Lombardo's drums are fast as well. This EP is Slayer at their prime and even if it's only four songs it's well worth the price. Below are my views on each song.Chemical Warfare 100000000000001/10, Yes it is that awesome, this is a legendary Slayer song and a fan favorite. If you're gonna buy this for one song this is it, the lyrics are great and I love the riffs in this track.Captor Of Sin 10/10, The opening of the song is great. The song is really good too. My second favorite on this EP as well.Haunting the Chapel 7/10, I didn't really care for this song much, it's good but not mind blowing.Aggressive Perfector 10/10, Slayer's first song ever, the opening sorta reminds me of Metallica's "Hit The Lights" but the song is very different though. A part of this song sonds like the guitars are making video game like noises. The vocals are also a little different from other releases but it's still awesome. Overall this EP was a great follow up to their debut. It also led to what the band would later become, thrash legends. A must have for fans and general metal fans alike. Highly reccomended
We bought this - on cassette - in Washington DC on our first day of honeymoon in September 1997. Having flown from Northern Ireland, it provided us with the perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from  Washington to Nashville, along the Skyline drive, down through South West  Virginia, across Eastern Kentucky to Berea, and down to Smoky Mountains  National Park in Tennessee. We are from an Ulster-Scots/Scotch-Irish  background, and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that  our forebears had settled in so many centuries before, bringing thier  fiddles and folk songs with them, creating what was the core of mountain  old-time music and bluegrass. From the Carter Family right through, every  song is a classic. You must buy this
This album is hard! E-40 always come sic wit it. If you don't got it, ya betta git it. It reminds me of his (my fav.)I a major way album. Sluppin' from intro till outro. He is the bay area's finnest. Please belave it
More like 3.5.So. Half of this album is excellent. The rest is filler. But, due to "Times Like These", "All My Life", Disenchanted Lullaby (the intro irritates me but it gets better), "Have It All" (kinda sappy but I love the intro), "Low" (have you SEEN the video?) and "Overdrive" (again, kinda sappy but there's something about it I love), the album is pretty enjoyable. It doesn't compare to the first three, but it has its moments. The riffs are slightly heavier, most songs are pretty upbeat. "Times Like These" is an instant classic with awesome lyrics, while "All My Life" rocks harder than pretty much all previous songs. Kinda sucks how the best songs are/were singles, but if they had released other songs, no-one would buy the album. Mind you, my friend loves "Burn Away", so listen to the previews and make your own mind up
I heard this music on the excellent P B S Documentary: Liberty - the American Revolution and I knew I had to have it! It is the finest music I have heard, capturing the heart and soul of the American Revolution. The documentary Liberty was a masterpiece that was beautiful and moving. So too this music with its most wonderful arrangements and accompaniment. I love it! I could hardly wait to get it in the mail. It framed the documentary (which I also bought) like a great frame compliments a beautiful canvas painting. Superlatives fail me. This music must be experienced by first watching the great series on the American Revolution and then by listening to it apart. This is some of the most wonderful music I have ever heard. It reminds me of the genius of Aaron Copland who wrote the Applachian Spring and Rodeo suites
This is a great CD. Back Where I Come From, is on of those feel good songs that gives me chill bumps every time I here it. Chesney is a extremely talented artist whose passion is shown in every song. I  recommend all his albums
Very rich in music, fully orchestrated and full of energy. I highly recommend this album for everyone who loves New Age music and to all those who like Classical Music. David took it to another level on this one. I myself like New Age artists that incorporate Orchestra to their music and that is why I loved this album. If you like this album, I recommend you to explore Yanni, Secret Garden, Giovanni and Bernward Koch
The music here frequently reminded me of Pagan's Mind with a touch of Porcupine Tree and flashes of Iron Maiden.  A fantastic mixture of 1970s Progressive rock bands such as Yes and Kansas molded with European-style Power Metal and Brazilian folk music.  While this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that don't quite mesh.  In actuality I give the CD 4.5 stars for its superb songcraft and inspired, sometimes flawed ambition.  But as an overall package, this Special Edition of "Temple of Shadows" is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus DVD holds a concert in 5.1 surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog.  This is a great album filled with high quality Progressive Power Metal and a DVD concert that gives a taste of their other albums (not to mention it's just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves, smiling throughout the show).  Highly recommended.
Solas' previous CD Words That Remain is a classic in Irish traditional music and the loss of Karan Casey certainly affects their sound on this album. However, instrumentally they are incredibly strong and as inventive as ever and Deirdre Scanlon is a gifted singer with a wide range of styles. I don't think the choice of tracks is quite so strong but it is a powerful performance of a very high order of music. The instrumental playing at times leaves you breathless and the energy levels are very high. There are some lovely songs - i like Bonnie Mae and Miner's Life in particular and I Will Remember You is an original gem. I am disappointed to hear critics complain of the lack of traditional music on the CD and about the use of rock instruments. Based on those criteria the only instruments tolerated would be harp, uillean pipes, wooden flute and fiddle (tin whistle (flageolet), guitar, mandolin, bouzouki, accordion and banjo being modern, foreign invaders)and what a pity! What defines traditional - is it pre-Planxty? Can no more traditional songs be written? Seamus Egan and Co have done their apprenticeship in the rigorous disciplines from the book of traditional music (rhythm and melody) and have enriched it with a new chapter. In general i agree that bass and percussion is often unnecessary but in this case the augmentations are tasteful and generally effective. I would also highly revcommend Liz Carroll's Lost in the Loop although if you're a purist it has the Solas rhythm section playing on it and features many of Liz's brand new traditional tunes (brilliant)
First off, I'd like to say that I am not a Country music fan, but I am a Johnny Cash fan. He transcends the genre that turned his back on him in his later years, but here the man can do no wrong. Now, I bought the 2000 "expansion" release of this concert which at the time was dubbed the "complete concert recording". It was misleading because I had seen the British documentary (the DVD of this is included in the set)in which Johnny   friends were performing songs I never knew existed from this legendary event because they were absent on CD. Now this is the full sha-bang, complete with amazing packaging, the concert spread over two CDs, and the DVD mentioned above. If you bought the previous CD like I did, let me tell you, this is worth the upgrade as it seems this is the "definitive end to all release" of Johnny singing to the boys at San Quentin.For new fans, the single CD release might be the best place to start since it has at least 85% of what Johnny sang that night at San Quentin. The rest of the legacy tracks feature The Carter Family, Carl Perkins, and The Statler Bros.So if you're looking for a "Johnny Cash" solo concert, then get the single CD version. If you want the absolute complete version in a great package, 40 page booklet, and he Legendary British Documentary of this concert for the first time on DVD; The Legacy Edition of this memorable night is the way to go
Mountain Music offers what Alabama is famous for, great music and great harmony all packaged together. The title cut is great, that harmonica and old man of the mountain intro is unique. As for Close Enough to Perfect if any man sings that song to his lady, she is his forever. The cuteness of Never Be One also reminds us of the sadness that our children grow up so fast we hardly know it. There isn't a bad song on the whole CD and will make a good addition to any collection
Better balance of songs on this Cd. This Cd shows growth in a the band.They are great fun live check them out if you get the chance!!!!!!!
This is a wonderful view into what is the best and worst about a Tedeschi concert.  She can be as soulful as the best of the blues singers but it also exposes her weakness:  She just can't rock enough to provide the balance her act needs.  She's terrific on the ballads but isn't a good enough guitar player to hold up the guitar playing for a band so they have to make do with her fabulous vocals.  She's got solid keyboards and vocals in support, so it's not apparent until half way through the gig.  But keyboards can't provide enough of an edge to the very few fast, upbeat songs and the whole concert lags.  Zzzzz by 2/3rds of the way through.  Look at the audience at the end of the concert when she plays a lethargic version of "I Fell in Love."  Very few people (besides the B3 player who has kept the only energy up through the show) are energized.Put this DVD on when you're in bed with a glass a red wine with your loved one and the fireplace is going and it'll be terrific, at least until you fall asleep
"The Passion of the Christ - Songs" is a fine collection of great songs, each in their own way a reaction to the spectacular film that Mel Gibson has created. The standouts are the song "I See Love" by Steven Curtis Chapman, Third Day an MercyMe; Scott Stapp's powerful solo debut song "Relearn Love;" "Rainy Day" by Big Dismal, and the emotional "New Again" by Brad Paisley and Sarah Evans.  Despite a couple of songs that don't reach their true potential ("The Passion," and "How Many Lashes"), this is a fine CD that belongs in anyone's and everyone's Christian music collection. Grade: A-
if you are a fan of Oscar Peterson this belongs in your collection
If you are a fan of the Winter's Solstice series, than you will enjoy this cd, especially if you like the earlier volumes with the more original pieces rather than mostly traditional christmas music.
Sorry, ya just can't replace Michael Hutchence. This is a great overview of all of their greatest hits.  I am not a huge fan of greatest hits CDs b/c people tend to buy them and, therefore, miss all of the excellent songs that weren't released as singles.  All INXS CDs are worth buying separately. But, if you must.....this will work
Miss Saigon is my favorite all-time musical!  I was hesitant when buying this recording because in my mind Lea Salonga is and always will be Kim!  But I was pleasantly surprised.  Joanna Ampil as Kim holds her own.  While she doesn't have the vocal range of Lea, she has a beautiful, crisp voice which she uses to emote the emotional turmoil of Kim.  She expresses herself in a way that makes you feel her love, pain and anguish and in turn she makes this part her own.  The rest of the cast is superb (especially the amazing Ruthie Henshall as Ellen) but make no mistake, this show belongs to Ampil!I also fell in love with some of the material left out of the LCR.  There a beautiful bridges and songs which enrich the story.  "Back in Town" stands out for me because of the gorgeous melodies.  Anyone who has fallen in love with the story of "Miss Saigon" will appreciate these added gems!  This cast recording is definitely worth a listen!
In many ways, this album is everything one would have expected-- somehow the natural successor to "No Pussyfooting" and "Evening Star".  In other ways, its nothing like I would have expected-- the usual stamps of Fripp and Eno's recent work seems to be missing.Its really quite hard to largely identify the identity of the musician generating the sound on much of this material, there's obvious stuff (we'll come to that in a minute), but as a rule, the backgrounds could be either of them.  Sonically, it moves through a number of backdrops, with delicate, percussive, synthish loops dominating the early part of the record ("Meissa", "Lyra", "Tarazed"), wheras the middle of the record feels more like their old collaborations updated, the sort of modern Fripp soundscapes being more apparent ("Lupus", "Ankaa").  The remainder of the album features on track that is totally unexpected, the downright funky "Altair", with its train shuffling rhythms, drum loops, and funky guitar (in ways similar to material from the Eno/Schwaum "Drawn from Life" record), and the closer, "Terebellum", is an aggressive, haunting, and almost angry sounding piece almost reminiscent of "Radiophonics" or the other more aggressive soundscapes.Over this material, Fripp largely solos using a variant of his legendary fuzz tone-- its a bit mellower, and rounder though, similar to his leads on "Starless" and "The Power to Believe Part II" but in a more hushed feel.So that tells not much, the real question is, what's it like?  Largely an ambient affair, the collaboration is what you'd expect-- there's no real incindiery moments here-- don't look for a "Baby's On Fire", but it is comparable to their previous collaborations in quality, and it certainly sounds nothing like Crimson.  Some of it is full of delicate beauty ("Lyra"), some of its just a blast ("Altair"), some of its actually quite hard to listen to at all ("Terebellum").For fans of ambient music, especially the work of these two gentelemen, this one will be quite rewarding.  It falls short somehow of being a masterpiece, but it is really a great record.  Recommended
Hands down, a 5 star, two thumbs up, classic joint.  After it dropped, Puba reigned supreeeme.  Disregard the Amazon reviewer, there are no "gaffes" in this one, period...  These guys were true to their beliefs.  They weren't packaging a product for "pop" consumption, they were telling a generation what THEY THOUGHT.  Check it out and the music will speak for itself.  The best track in my opinion was "Wake UP", but the whole album was great.  As someone else mentioned, fast tracks put it in the 90's but most of the tracks are relevant sound as good as ever. 
My roomate from two years ago had a cd of Doris; and I must admit, at first, I was a little skeptical.  But soon I became stunned by her vocal prowess and the emotional heart juice that she brought to these classic  songs.  Plus, you should see her in a football uniform!  Man can she catch  the pigskin
This is Roxys last gasp...I mean "wheres Eddie Jobson??" Actually this really a good recording, its just that the first 5 Roxy Music albums were so flawlessly perfect that its hard to stand up against that level of perfection...anyway..with that said...I have NO IDEA why they took off the great rock version and put the disco-fluff version of Angel Eyes, which is hard to find on CD. This, to me is really the last Roxy Music Album, because you just CANT have Roxy Music without Paul Thompson...sorry. I mean Avalon and the others are nice pieces, but they really should have been Bryan Ferry solo albums because Andy and Phil are really playing more as session players there
I wonder if the two reviewers who said they were disappointed in this soundtrack watched the film? My guess is that they did not. The film was ENHANCED by the James Horner score and it would have been hurt by anything that was not light and subtle. It is a unique and amazing film and the score is a perfect match. By the way, the bigwigs at Universal nearly died when they heard it and then were equally stunned when they asked Horner for the written score and he had to admit that none existed!WONDERFUL MUSIC
What can I say about Vince Gill that his many fans haven't already mentioned.  I had never been particularly interested in country music.  But, one day I was listening to a country radio station and Vince Gill was singing When Ever You Come Around and I was hooked. This CD is as consistant as all his others. Great lyics and superb musicianship. I rate this five stars as I believe Gill is one of the best singer songwriters in the world today
Brilliant, glorious music--all of it, although I agree with those who have come to feel that the Ellington/Strayhorn version of The Nutcracker Suite, in particular, is an all-too-often-buried treasure that no Christmas season should be without (and if you can ignore it for the rest of the year, you have more willpower than I).  What happens to Tchaikovsky's marvellous music--and Grieg's, too--in these hands is creative homage of the highest order: the music is re-imagined from the inside, in wholly jazz terms, in a way that simultaneously illuminates and completely reconceives the original.  What Balanchine did for Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky in dance, Ellington here does for Tchaikovsky and Grieg in another realm of music, and leaves us with works that deserve to be every bit as loved and celebrated as their older and better-known prototypes.  And to top it all off, you get Ellington and Strayhorn's own superb Suite Thursday.  Listen and rejoice
This CD is Dave Bromberg's best effort. Playing solo allows his guitar playing capabilities to be clearly demonstrated.
I love this album but the other review from Anonymous is wrong. this cd is not remastered. I baught this cd because of that review and got burned. The cd even says right on it AAD. in other words analog recording/analog master/digital playback. I will say this much though, the transfer is better than MCA's version which I own. However, If you want a remastered version of the song Monster look to the "All Time Greatest Hits/Original Recording Remasterd" cd From MCA. It also Has Move Over from this cd, I Love this cd and want it remastered. If you gotta have this album (I Do) than this version sounds better than the MCA version
This is one of the ultimate collection's of pure music at its finest....1 problem thou...on the inside cd cover all the tracks have the wrong names...kinda crazy if u like to rip songs for your collection :(
This album has new meaning to me now in 2007, where I go to a college next to a high school, where I see a bunch of "punk rockers" spending lots of money to make sure their hair is pretty and that their clothes are properly tattered to maximize trendiness.  There are plenty of punk rock bands out there that keep the spirit of Social Distortion alive, but sometimes their music is hard to find, and all the posers you see start to slowly extinguish that old punk rock fire.  Albums like this exist for times like those.  Just stick it in, turn up the volume, and rock out
I felt compelled to write a review having read another written by someone who gave it one out of five stars.  I felt it a grossly misleading and inaccurate review, so here I am...As a musician I could think of nothing more intimidating than attempting to cover a Buckley song.  Their fan bases are fiercely loyal and protective of their material.  So first things first I would like to congratulate the artists for their bravery.  Furthermore a quick glance down the list of performers will quell any suspicions that this is 'just another tribute record cashing in on someone else's success', these are musicians that know what they're doing.What struck me the most was the variety of voices on this disc; you have the ethereal whisper of Sufjan Stevens, sweet folk harmonies of the Magic Numbers, the lazy drawl Micah P. Hinson.  Not only that, but these are great interpretations from the Jeff  Tim cannon.  Very inspired and innovative - a beautiful accordion riff on 'Grace' , an Irish-jig inflected 'No Man Can Find The War'...these artists do not desire to replace Jeff or Tim, they're merely reuniting us with what they left us - their music. 
Basie's best players come to Duke's place, the Columbia Records 30th Street Studios in 1961 and face Ellington's finest. Not a battle, but not quite a merger, either, since the Count's contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel. There's more than an hour of good music on here, laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras. Popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible. This is one of those rare CD's in which the booklet is almost as good as the music. This one reveals that during this 12-hour late-afternoon-to-early-morning session, one of Ellington's long-time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague. Also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics. Basie hated Columbia's first idea to bill the date as a competition, and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art. The end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt because no one knows its name. The cover finally chosen says "The Count Meets the Duke" but in larger letters it declares "FIRST TIME!" and then adds "2 Great Orchestras" and finally states "Duke Ellington and Count Basie." The label Columbia/Sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says "Duke Ellington MEETS Count Basie" which makes no sense because they had known each other since the 20's. If you already like both orchestras, you'll want to own this late career session. If you want an introduction to each group in its waning years,  the CD serves nicely for that, too. This disc really jives, so don't be expecting any ballads here
This arrived the other day, I pre ordered it. Two of the greatest songwriters ever in my opinion. Its about time this was available on CD and here it is. Sounds great! Go get it for the collection
I get the sense that The Fleetwoods'body of recorded work isn't given the respect it deserves. Over the course of their career, the trio recorded thirteen albums and yet this collection, as good as it is, is pretty much all that's out there on cd, save for a few other compilations that cover much of the same ground. Rock and roll has always had a soft side and it's in this area that the Fleetwoods really shine. Their cover of Thomas Wayne's Tragedy is an evocative slice of 1961 teen angst-I can't put it any other way. Maybe that's the reason why the Fleetwoods are given short shrift today: they're the perfect embodiment of a (then)nascent teen culture's soft and gentle side.This collection features all of their hits, some well chosen album tracks and the original pre-overdub version of Come softly to me. If you like this recording, try looking for their original lps. (My personal favourite is the 1963 Goodnight my Love album.
If you're a Dion fan don't miss this CD. All the hits including my favourite - Donna the Prima Donna
I don't like this album as much as their earlier stuff. I have liked each release less than the previous, and this one falls right in line with that trend. The opener Quality Revenge . . . is one of their best songs hands down, though. This is a very good CD, but the farther from Braid we get in time the less I seem to like their music
My first Monk album was Monk's Dream from Columbia.  I loved that album 15 years ago and had been searching for the same satisfaction from the multitude of Monk recordings from the Blue Note Years, Presitge, and Riverside.  What Monk's Dream offered that the prior work lacked, was production.  Raw, edgy, spontaneous ...yes all those recordings offered that.  But I longed for that sense of confidence, tightness and richness of sound Monk's Deream provided.  I found that in this set which makes sense since Monk's Dream came out of these sessions at Columbia.  So what if these are reworks of the old stuff...they sound just as new and gripping produced as they did in their earlier days without big money helping out.  WIll I throw out my older stuff and just play this? No chance..there is a time for polish and a time for purity
What makes a voice distinctive and memorable? Nat (King )Cole I believe had the smoothest voice of any male singer. Clarity and a sureness in phrasing was also gifts of his. Aside from 'Unforgettable' the songs I best remember are 'Mona Lisa' and 'Nature Boy'. But this recording also includes originals of the 'Nat King Cole trio'. It also includes  the famous duet put together of 'Unforgettable' from his early version and his daughter Natalie Cole's recording made after he had passed on. That particular recording was a 'knockout' sentimental and beautiful.
This is their best studio album.  What more can I say?  Brokedown Palace may be the most beautiful rock song of all time.  A must
I purchased my first Weill recordings in 1960, the off-broadway Threepenny Opera, and Lenya's Berlin Theater Songs. I have treasured them all my life. Lenya was, of course, incomparable, but Ute Lemper carries on her special genius. This new recording is as near a perfect realization of this unique masterpiece. John Mauceri gives the unique orchestration nuance that even Klemperer missed in his masterful Kleine Dreigroschenmusik. Every member of the cast, even the bit roles, is perfect in the characterization. Kollo is the first performer since Harald Paulsen (the origninal Mackie Messer) to bring all of the tradition of Viennese operetta to this music. He is a miracle. Macheath has subtle characteriztion hitherto unknown except from Paulsen. Most noteworthy is the Jenny of Milva. Two delightful bonuses in the recording: a reprise in Act 2 of Seerauber Jenny by Milva (the Jenny) and the inclusion of Lucy Brown's aria after the Jealousy duet. There is brief dialog before most pieces which  adds a dramatic integrity to the recording. I cannot find high enough praise for this new treasure
I admit when I listened to this album I was blown away by the powerful content of Kenny G's music. I was moved by the story line and also by the music that was used during  the movie. Kenny G's music is perfect for this kind of movie. Not only that it adds flavor to the movie by his sensual playing of saxophone but also adds mood to the entire show. This is the perfect soundtract for the movie Dying Young because it just simply shows the real mood in the movie
That Nigga's Crazy and Bicentennial Nigger both surpass this album in laughs, but it would still rank high if it wasn't for the poor sound quality--there's a few audience members who can be heard a lot more clearly  than Pryor himself half the time.  But some great classic bits, and believe  me you're never bored
THREE SIX MAFIA has out done there self with this new guy CHROMEabout every song is decent which is hard to find these days 
This talented woman can sing anything. I really enjoyed this cd with the lights turned down and a glass of wine to relax after a very stressful day at work. Renee could definitely have another singing career outside of opera should she choose. Hearing her drop that gorgeous voice down one octave rivals the best chanteuses in the business - Cassandra Wilson, Nancy Wilson, Regina Belle, Sarah Vaughan, etc. This cd of different musical styles reminds me of Nina Simone and Cassandra Wilson, two great singers whom could interpret any song genre and make their versions special. I loved all the songs and the standouts here are "Haunted Heart", "River", "My One and Only Love", "My Cherie Amour", "Cancao do Amor", and Beatles "In My Life", and "Hard Times Come Again No More". I hope Renee keeps recording whatever catches her fancy because I'll certainly always listen
I can't believe the harshness of some of the comments on this album.  Not a lot of in between among the notices -- those that hate are mean and heartless.  Very hurtful.  Lousy counterpoint to her warmth.  I don't think they understand that she doesn't have to lose control to be meaningful and touching.  Take her as an original instead of as a mimic.  What do I hear?  I love her lush voice on this album and Fred Hersch's brilliant piano accompaniment.  Bill Frisell is very good, too.  I love jazz  pop as well as opera.  Ren?e Fleming can make it any of these genres. These songs are very much her own interpretation.  They are 'deeper' than what you've heard before.  Even if I prefer Nancy Wilson or Eva Cassidy singing "You've Changed," Ren?e Fleming sings it warmly and beautifully, in her own style, and very touching, too.  She's not carried by full orchestration, mostly just Fred and her.  I was going to write that "My One and Only Love" was especially good, but as the cd kept playing, I must say that they are all especially good.  Enjoy
When a young artist names her first two albums not Judy or Collins but A Maid Of Constant Sorrow and Golden Apples Of The Sun,you know she takes herself seriously.Originaly released in 1961. and 1962. their names were all I knew until I saw this CD recently.Who will buy this? I wondered just to see the only copy snatched right in front of me.The comparisons with first two Baez albums are inevitable (some songs were recorded by both) althought Collins shows much more passion and involment where Baez seemingly seduces herself with the beauty of her voice.On these early albums Collins is frighteningly devoted keeper of the flame and her repertoire is almost exclusively traditional - which means not only ethereal beauty but also a certain (to some ears,overpowering) seriousness,cleverly mellowed by inclusion of joyous O Daddy Be Gay,a cousin to her Grandfather recorded years later.Althought I honestly love these songs and listen only this CD for days,these early albums are today much more significant as seeds of Collins later trademarks (voice will soar much higher in the future,she slipped W.B.Yeats into traditional folk collection just to later blossom into first-rate art-pop singer) and as they were product of their Greenwich Village times,they may sound a bit dated to some modern ears.But they are still hauntingly beautiful to me,I waited their re-release for too long
Excellent 24 track compilation of this surperb psychedelic Dutch band. Each tune was a single sometime between 1965-69. These guys are NOT to be confused with a U.S. band from the same era of the same name. Cuts that make this CD a true keeper are "Sun's Going Down", the tripping "Feel Like I Wanted To Cry", "Keep On Trying", the familiar sounding "Touch" and "Ballad Of John B". This is yet ANOTHER band I've heard at least one or two tracks on the Rhino release of 'Original Artyfacts: Nuggets II' 4-CD box set.Should appeal to fans of Pretty Things,Q65,early Beatles,Creation and The Action.A must-have
La pelicula es mas o menos, pero la banda sonora es buena, en especial la cancion #1 CRUSH de GARBAGE, es una excelente cancion...
I put off buying this for many years.  Having heard many posthumous albums that were just hideous, I didn't want to taint my perceptions of the Queen legacy.  So I ignored this album.  Then, one day, I was listening to Innuendo and that old curiosity crept in again.  I came here and read many positive reviews, so I took the plunge.  I came out the other side very content. The legacy had not been tainted.The album is uneven in places, but the songs that are good are VERY good (Mother Love, Let me Live).  With some albums like this, it is often easy to tell that the vocals were spliced in.  Now, I don't know exactly how this was done, but the songs feel seamless, even the dance track "You Don't Fool Me," which I can picture being blasted at high volumes in a late-night club.  Of course there is some sadness in the songs and that feeling that time is running out (especially in "Mother Love"), but upon the conclusion of the album, I want to say to the Brian and the boys (men), "You've done good.
Ms. Melua is from Georgia.  Her voice is quite like the Swede, Lisa Ekdahl.  Neither has range or power; both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse.  Both have musical partners.  In Ms. Melua's case it is Mike Batt who is to her what Nelson Riddle was to Linda Rondstadt, except that, in addition to arranging and conducting and coaching, he writes songs.  Most of this album are her and/or his songs.  They are well written and well treated.  They are are a careful team abnd do not cut corners.  Mr. Batt, among many other things, worked with Steeleye Span and Art Garfunkel long ago.The original sogs are interesting and liquid pleasant in rendition.  But my favorite cut is her rendering "Blues in the Night", which some might remember from Looney Tunes cartoons many decades past; "My mama done tole me..." it starts.  Knowing she cannot belt it, instead she works it.One short note on Steve Sale's engineering because another reviewer was crabbing about reverb and above all, clipping.  Perhaps because I bought it on vinyl, but I hear none of these defects.  My set is revealing, and it reveals excellent engineering, considering the largeish ensemble Mr. Batt has assembeled.  Fear not, unless the CD really is badly made
Watching the Melvins evolve was extremely interesting and entertaining. They began as an unassuming punk band, and proceded to incorporate the heaviness of 70's rock into their sound. Then they stripped away any and all of the "punk" trappings and went for pure HEAVY. It all culminated with this record. It just doesn't get any heavier than 'Roman Bird Dog/Hung Bunny'. 'With Teeth', rumored to actually be written by Joe Preston, is one of my all time favorite Melvins songs. Speaking of Joe Preston, he was the by far best of the Melvins' 7000+ bassists they had over the years. Shame they got rid of him shortly after this album. As soon as they fired him, they went straight down the greased pole to mediocrity Hell. Bad karma. Thank God that rock bands record their music so that it isn't lost forever every time they make stupid decisions. The only song on this record which I don't like is the cover of Alice Cooper's 'The Ballad of Dwight Fry'. Thankfully they made up for it with a cover of Flipper's 'Sacrifice'. Some of the Melvins' subsequent records have their moments (Stoner Witch's 'Shevil', Stag's 'Cotton Mouth'), but for the most part it seems to me that the Melvins gave up the ghost after recording this. Maybe someday they'll make a comeback
When I bought this CD it was for a little bit of nostalgia - Those Were The Days.  Since playing it once when it blew me away with the tracks and the memories, I have played it so often that if it were vinyl it would be worn out by now.  If you liked Mary Hopkins then this is a fantastic selection of her music and well worth a place in your collection
I am a Motown,Oldies,Rb,Soul,Love Songs, music Lover.I like the songs  that hit the heart and soul and hearing them brings back memories that come  alive to the rhythem and Bill Withers definately fits right in there. I  don't realy have a favorite artist because I like sooooo many of them but  if I had to pick my top 10, this album would be in there
no diggity was a monster hit in 1996. If you love this album you will also love michael jackson's dangerous, which was also co-produced with teddy riley, the lead singer of blackstreet
I just saw the movie and throughly enjoyed the performance by all the actors involved.  Kevin Spacey has a velvety, smooth voice.   I was surprised to learn his background is in musicals.  He has a beautiful voice and in this movie, it rocks!!!  Love the music!  I highly recommend you buying the CD and the DVD
All of the Isleys early work without the younger Isleys is just as good with them. But these early workouts are more raw-stripped down and pop-oriented. Ron Isley has a way of making country, and rock remakes sound like they were never before recorded. Not too many black artists can do that. To get a taste of the Real Isleys before the Mr. Biggs persona, get this with Get into something, and Givin' it back
Julieta Venegas did it again. She scored an album that is not alternative in style, however it is very catchy pop music. Her melodies are perfect for a morning drive with the radio on. You can sing along and express day to day feelings. Julieta continues to use instruments I like such as the harmonica. And of course, Julietas nice character and her lovely behavior shine through in her public appearances. My personal favorite is "Me voy", a very positive song about a not so positive event, breaking-up. Keep up the good work, Julieta. Your songs are appreciated.
I thought this album was good not great, but saying that i do recomend it to everyone because it does have some great songs it.The best songs on the cd to are.2. Comfortable Liar   3. Send The Pain Below    4. Closure    5. The Red   6. Wonder What's Next  And my favorite track is #2 it sounded so sweet, you will love that song
One can't go wrong with this one.  A classic, which according to the well written liner notes was recorded 3 days after opening night.  And, a pit orchestra that sounds like a pit orchestra...before the days of electronic music
...heart-wrenching break-up with his girlfriend of 8 years, Elastica's Justine Frishmann.  13 is a dark record, produced by William Orbit.  Nearly every song is injected with despair, sorrow, bitterness, and an achy, heart-breaking sadness.  These moods are encompassed on such tracks as Tender, 1992, Battle, and the tear-jerking No Distance Left to Run.  Also included are the trip-hop masterpiece Trimm Trabb, the humourous Trailerpark and B.L.U.R.E.M.I., and Coxon and Albarn's co-written pop-masterpiece, Coffee and TV
The relaxation set is just that, pure relaxation.  I love the active relaxation CD.  I can read or work and I am real calm, on an even keel, feeling like when you go to sleep at night, not quite asleep and not quite awake.  I also enjoy the water and the piano playing.  Highly recommended
Ministry Of Sound has always had the reputation of putting out the best music.  They have a way of findind the best DJ's, Artists, producers and remixers from the 4 corners of the earth and bringing them to us on a CD.  This CD is no exception. Soothing beats without lacking in tempo or energy, this CD could literally be enjoyed by a cowbow from Kentucky.  It's just that palattable
It all started when I was a little kid and my dad gave me this album (he wasn't a fan, he probably picked it up with a crate of used records.)  It was one of my first exposures to rock and roll.  Nearly 30 years later I still own the original vinyl (the one that had the exploding fire extinguisher rooster album cover.)  I am glad to have it now on CD, the vinyl being about as scratched and pitted as can possibly be and still be remotely playable.  I dissent the reviewers who praise DuCann over Crane, for really, it IS after all Vincent Crane's project (Crane, also organist for Crazy World of Arthur Brown.)  A keyboard player myself I consider Crane one of my biggest influences and I hold great admiration for his playing.  DuCann and Hammond also deserve praise for their performances, but it should be painfully obvious who the star of an organ driven rock band is: Um, the audience ... er, no the organist!  Take a trip back in time and enjoy this classic work
This is such an good industrial album, that I was sitting and listening to it and all the adjectives that I wanted to use seemed not good enough. However, if I have to put one then it has to be these, brilliant, astounding, stupendous and awesome. This is probably one of the best industrial albums of all time. The first track is good and then it just gets better and better. In fact the first track is not as good as the other ones and could have been replaced with another track. The book-let is ok but the lyrics are missing, but still it is an important release since it showed that inudtrial bands are tallented muisicians and can sing. Minphaser, Life Line, Guna are some of the best made industrial tracks ever with the intricate layers of sounds, bets and samples. The keyboard sounds are constantly amazing and this is an album not to be missed if one likes industrial music
Adios Marks the real goodbye from KMFDM.  After they went on to do MDFMK which was decent and then they came back.  Attak, was really weak because it was all Sascha and Skold and though I like them both, the absence of Gunter Schulz and En Esch really made this album absent in itself.  WWIII though it is a better and pretty decent album, KMFDM is still a little less present.     Adios gives us the remnants of what KMFDM fans know as KMFDM with Skold present but not taking over completely (Though I like Skold, But we need a break) We saw Nina Hagen lend her voice in "Witness" which is amazing, along with Ogre from Skinny Puppy in "That's All" and "Full Worm Garden" great tracksA little bit of Pig and Schulz's insane guitar riffs and you are all set. Even though En Esch was very minimal in the recording, infact I barely remember him...  Currently Working on "FUBAR", we'll see if KMFDM will impress again, They have it still, they are just not using their talents as of late, C'mon Sascha, you're great man, but get over yourself and get Schulz and Esch back... Bring back KMFDM... What would Skinny Puppy be without Cevin Key? what would Ohgr be without Ogre? What would Foetus be without Thirlwell? c'mon man.. Bring us back KMFDM...
My 8-month-old son and I listen to this CD every night, and by the Pachelbel Canon (track 7) he's usually sound asleep.  It is NOT ALL SYNTHESIZER.  The jacket clearly states that the "Music Box Orchestra" includes flute, piano, cello, percussion, english horn, and oboe.  As a musician, I am not offended by the "easy-listening" versions of these classics.  In fact, I enjoy them.  They introduce my son to the timeless melodies WITHOUT OVERSTIMULATING HIM at bedtime.  I find them relaxing too
This CD was well worth the wait!  It contains music and artists that were previously unavailable and not even heard on the radio in years.  I took one of the CDs out of the box, put it in the player, and within minutes my wife and I were dancing.  The sound quality, in my judgment is solid, the packaging is fun and creative, and the booklet containing the Cameo Parkway "story" was an interesting read.  There will always be arguments about stuff that was included and not included, but this is an excellent overview of a wonderful era.  What great fun to hear the Orlons, Chubby Checker, The Tymes, The Dovells, Bobby Rydell, and Dee Dee Sharp once again. 
I can't say enough how great this album is. Grant Green was one of the most soulful jazz guitarists who ever graced the planet. His soloing on this CD is filled with beautiful melodicism matched with a bluesy grit that is such a pleasure to listen to. And for me as a guitarist it has been an encyclopedia of how to play blues from a jazz perspective. My favorites are Miss Ann's Tempo and Blues for Willarene. It is such a shame that he died so young and never collected his just due
This is one of my personal favorites.  I bought this CD when my daughter was 1 month old.  We would listen to it during those "late night" feedings to create a peaceful environment.  I'm pretty sure it was a benefit for her.  It was definitely a benefit for me
I was introduced to Nitin through my cousin who lives in England. She saw him live in London and raved about it...so off I went in search of this artist. He was difficult to find; nonetheless I was determined. I am one of those people who love music from almost all genres, cultures and corners of the globe. In other words, I am not a radio-pop saccharine sweet loving music listener. I look for music that proposes thought (although I do believe even top 40 has its place) If you are looking for an album/artist that resonates emotion, along with a powerful subtlety check Nitin Sawhney out. You won't be disappointed.
Chandos' Grainger Edition is a significant contribution to modern art.This particular volume (Vol. 14) features Grainger's settings of various folk and popular songs which he made in the first quarter of the 20th Century.  The accompaniments are set for small ensembles, and Grainger utilized the harmonium on many of the song settings on this disc.Sound is 24-bit
This is Jeff Beck's best album.  A masterpiece of guitar work.  This is an all instrumental album that features what Jeff does best - play guitar.  The supporting band is excellent especially the drum work.  Production quality is excellent as well.  While I wouldn't consider JB a blues guitarist I would consider him one of the top 10 guitarist ever and this album show cases why.  A great companion album to Blow by Blow is Wired.  It's a shame that after Wired his record company made him go back to albums with vocals.  He has on a roll and at a level that he has rarely gotten back to. If you like guitar and can live without vocals buy this album. You will not be disappointed
Forza Eros!  May you live to make much more great music! Whether you  understand Italian or not, I heartily recommend this CD. In Ogni Senso  lives up to its billing- it delights each and every one of the human  senses, in ALL sense of the expression. This is a must-have for  any true music lover
Lead singer and co-founder David Gates was recently inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.  This album is one prime example of why.  David has consistently provided beautiful melodies with easy, sensitive lyrics.   His last album was a country album called Love Is Always  Seventeen, which was a genre-crossing mix of pop and country,  co-produced and performed with Billy Dean.  But back to this gem.   Guitar Man, and Aubrey were the big hits off of  this album, and they still stand the test of time.  Tecolote is  one of their most unusual departures, and still makes me laugh, while  enjoying its musicality and orignality.  Didn't Even Know Her  Name is a poignant lost love song; Welcome to the Music  is one of those opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to  what to expect.  Even Larry Knechtel gets in on the vocals with the  intriguing Picture in My Mind.  It's a great album---in fact,  there's not a bad Bread album out there!  Enjoy, and relive  those magical moments of the glorious seventies
This is what I grew up with on the radio, and listened to at the dance halls.  This is not some sissy nashville sound.
I purchased this CD after reading one of the reviews.  I have another Streetwize CD that I love, but I was a litter weary about getting this one (Jazz meets Dre and all).  But I am glad I made the purchase, as I am thoroughly enjoying it
   Like many before me,this "blue" Beatles best-of served as my first,in-depth sampling of The Beatles' output from their post-'Revolver' era from early-1967 onward... You couldn't find a better 100+ minutes of music to listen to straight through than the superb 28 tracks that make up 'The Beatles 1967-1970'. I bought this initially back in the winter of 1988 (I was 18 at the time) on cassette,and it changed my life. True; the 2-cd version often retails at $34.00,which is a bit much,but the material contained is beyond priceless.. About the songs. The songs!! There's not a lame one among the batch of 28. What's even cooler is that -even as the songs unfurl chronologically- they pack a flow to rival any of anyone's favorite best-of albums... The flow of all 28 is remarkable... A fantastic mix of all their late '60's #1 hits as well as choice album cuts ("A Day In The Life","I Am The Walrus")... Seriously folks; anyone who is feeling the itch to discover The Beatles' later output should get this "blue" best-of first,then graduate onto the studio albums themselves.. That's what happened to me and I wound up (so far) buying all of the albums from 'Rubber Soul' (1965) onwards... This blue '1967-1970' never disappoints. Because the liner notes/inlay booklet doesn't tell you which album each track is culled from,I'll happily fill you in:Disc One:1.)Strawberry Fields Forever(John in vocals)2.)Penny Lane(Paul on vocals)(Both originally released as a stand-alone single in early 1967 and both served as the first tracks recorded for what would be 1967's "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". However,the two songs weren't released on any Beatles' album until late-1967's 'Sgt. Pepper' follow-up 'Magical Mystery Tour'.)3.)Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band(Paul on vocals)4.)With A Little Help From My Friends (Ringo on vocals)5.)Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds(John on vocals)6.)A Day In The Life(John and Paul on vocals)3-6 from the legendary 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'; 1967.7.)All You Need Is Love (John on vocals)8.)I Am The Walrus(John on vocals)9.)Hello,Goodbye(Paul on vocals)10.)The Fool On The Hill (Paul on vocals)11.)Magical Mystery Tour(John on vocals)7-11 from 'Magical Mystery Tour'; 196712.)Lady Madonna(Paul on vocals)13.)Hey Jude(Paul on vocals)14.)Revolution(John on vocals)12-14 all stand-alone singles released in 1968. All were/arehuge hits. Sweet!Disc Two:1.)Back In The U.S.S.R.(Paul on vocals)2.)While My Guitar Gently Weeps(George on vocals)3.)Ob-La-Di,Ob-La-Da(Paul on vocals)1-3 taken from 1968's double-album 'The Beatles' (aka "The White Album").4.)Get Back(Paul on vocals) (Originally recorded 1969 as a single and not released on album until 1970's 'Let It Be'. Twistedly,'Let It Be' was recorded prior to 1969's final Beatles' studio album 'Abbey Road',but not released until later...)5.)Don't Let Me Down(non-album b-side to the "Get Back" single; John on vocals)6.)The Ballad Of John And Yoko (non-LP stand-alone single; John on vocals. One of the very few Beatles tracks recorded with only John and Paul playing all the instruments..)7.)Old Brown Shoe(b-side to "The Ballad Of John And Yoko"; George on vocals)All of the hits plus some choice b-sides as well.. Yeah!!8.)Here Comes The Sun(George on vocals)9.)Come Together(John on vocals)10.)Something(George on vocals)11.)Octopus's Garden (Ringo on vocals)(All culled from 1969's *true* final Beatle masterpiece,'Abbey Road')12.)Let It Be (Paul on vocals)13.)Across The Universe(John on vocals)14.)The Long And Winding Road (Paul on vocals)12-14 from 1970's (actually recorded early 1969) 'Let It Be'.So there you go... 28 of THE very best music ever to grace the world... (Seriously.) Please do yourself a favor and check out *any* Beatles' music. But a choice place to start certainly is here. Have Fun/Enjoy/Peace!Thanks for your time.Tim GoyerAlbany,NYUSA6/28/0
Sombre Romantic is a step up if you will in the gothic metal genre. It is a very solid album from start to finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting. Its not what you would really consider to be a "religious" album but there are many undertones that help get the message across. This point being made very clear in "Museum of Iscariot" which talks of Jesus from Judas' point of view.Rowan's vocal stylings change to meet the moods of every song on this album, from low opera type to screaming, in a superb way that stays consistent and never gets old. If you are into  relaxed darkwave/goth music this is a perfect album to purchase
This is a great Movie Soundtrack!. I'm a PASSPORT Fan since I was a kid back in the 70's. I have all Klaus Doldinger's official releases with his Passport signature. Please go and look for this CD "Running In Real Time" from Passport and listen to track number 2: Auryn. Then go and get all his Passport releases (almost 20 CDs since the 70's). Then you will see why Klaus Doldinger is very creative
Great Music, Great band. This is a must buy. Recommended to all hard rock lovers
After leaving (or being dismissed from) Pink Floyd in 1968 due to his LSD use  erratic behaviour, singer/songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett re-emerged in 1970 with his debut solo album, "The Madcap Laughs." The album did not come easy, as Syd never fully recovered from his drug use, and it clearly shows in his ragged performances on "Madcap Laughs." Producer Malcolm Jones did what he could with Syd for about half of the album, before handing the production reigns over to Barrett's former Floyd mates Roger Waters  David Gilmour to finish the job. Throughout the album, bum notes are played, beats are missed, and Barrett sings off-key. And on the rocker songs, the session players (from the group The Soft Machine) sound like they are struggling to keep up with Syd, who could hit a rough patch at any moment. For any other artist, this would all be nothing short of disastrous. And YET....in the case of Syd Barrett, any and all mistakes are immediately forgiven. Why? Because Barrett's songs on "The Madcap Laughs" are all wonderfully written, and although Syd's voice and guitar-playing are obviously not in tip-top condition, you can plainly hear on this album that he's trying. He's really, really *trying* to do his best, and his efforts really do shine through. For every bum note there's a passage that Syd plays beautifully, for every missed beat there are many beats that are hit right on schedule, and for every note that Syd sings off-key, there are many moments where his very distinctive, British voice is magical. And of course, there's Syd's lyrics. You may not know what all of them actually *mean*, really, but to my ears, they're still poetry. The rockers are still powerful ("No Good Trying," "No Man's Land," the rockabilly fun of "Here I Go," and the classic "Octopus"), and the softer numbers still have great beauty to them ("Terrapin," the passionate "Dark Globe," the effective "Golden Hair"---based on a James Joyce poem---and "Long Gone"). Even the more ragged numbers like "Feel" and "If It's In You," somehow still hang together quite well (amusingly, we even hear some brief banter from Syd in the middle of "If It's In You," as his voice goes wildly off the map, he stops playing, prepares for another take, and finally gets through the song). When all is said and done, "The Madcap Laughs," warts and all, is an excellent album. It is a flawed masterpiece, and it shows that Syd Barrett, even with his mind irreversibly fractured by this point, was still a genius musician.   
Though I am only 33 years old, I grew up listening to Bob Wills.  Merle Haggard did a great job with this one (as he always does).  I got goose bumps listening to it.  It took me back to my childhood when I would sit on  the porch with my Grandfather listening to Bob Wills.  The only thing  missing is the scratching of the needle on a nearly worn-out album
This is just a great CD. Whenever I need to restore inner harmony after work, or dealing with any upsetting situation, this is the one I go to. Instantly I am transported to the calm, soothing setting of a traditional Japanese house and garden. It is fantastic for meditation, too. Let all the nonessentials of life slip away while you listen to this beautiful recording
Del the Funky Homosapien has been my favorite MC for years, and this album doesn't dissapoint. The DVD is raw, and packs in lots of live footage, interviews, and is well produced. If you are a fan of Del, you know you have to pick this up.
Metheny's an innovator and has been all over the map over his long career in terms of styles, moods, textures, and sounds.Here we have an early effort in which he takes his guitar and overdubs an introspective, wide-open-spaces musical journey across America, weaving in jazz, folk, country, rock, mountain music, and everything in between.  If you love his work on Joni Mitchell's Amelia (performed live on Shadows and Light), you'll love the sound of this record.The mood is mellow but not dull, quiet but not silent, and the results are spectacular.  This is the cd to take with you on a trip across the western frontier, or a short hop to Burger King.  Works either way
      Tame's music is all about the beat. It's what got me right from the start, a grinding, repetitious backbone to every song. Tame One rides every beat on these tracks without faltering and shows some true style in his delivery. Tame gets rid of the verse-hook standarda, periodically ad-libing and allows the music to play when he feels like pausing. Its an amazing album well worth purchasing.
while i am not a big fan of john mcLaughlin or mahvishnu orchestra - i cannot deny that they really had something with this album.. It is something new - not just an extension of miles davis - they were breaking new territory...  There is a cohesiveness amongst the band members - of course abounding with improvisational talent - this is fushion but first of all it is music
I bought this CD before going to see MMW (with John Scofield) for the first time at First Avenue in Minneapolis Dec 7, 2006.  I had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue's website.  So I bought a ticket and wanted to get "Out Louder", which I knew they were going to play, to familiarize myself, but the store I was at was out of it.  So I bought "End of the World" instead.  While some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first, I still liked the overall funkiness of it all.  THEN....I saw them PLAY.  You MUST see them PLAY!!  I didn't ever want it to end! I immediately wanted to see them again!  It's less than a week later and I have 2 more CD's ("Out Louder" and Scofield's "A-Go-Go" which they "back" him on) and 4 more on the way from amazon as I'm writing this.  I'm like an ADDICT now!  I HAVE to have them on in the car and in the house.  I get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they're on and all is right with my world again.  I must say I like "Out Louder" and even "A-Go-Go" better than "End of the World", but only slightly.  It IS trippy with the synth and the other guest players, and I do like it better after a few listens.  I just prefer MMW with less guest musicians
I cannot stop listening to the song I Saved The World Today.  The CD is worth the price for this song alone.  The whole CD is great though ... classic Eurythmics that sounds as great today as their earlier work.  Annie Lennox gets all the attention ... and she deserves every bit, but Dave Stewart certainly deserves as much.  They make a great team and this CD should have been given much more attention in the USA.  I hope they don't take so long to do another one
Hell Rell did his job, I wasn't expecting anything as good as this. Hell Rell OUTDID himself.
As a former piano major I can assure those who would purchase this dusc that it is well worth it. Reminiscent (dare I say it?) of Horowitz
as with all of Zucchero's CD's, this is also wonderful.  I listen to it all the time, it's sensual and sexy and great
Trip hop and lounge lovers need to have this CD at home. Bajo Fondo Tango Club is not as pure tango as Piazzola's nor as chill out percolated as Gotan Project's, which makes them a band for all publics. Nor even one single person in my office couldn't help download at least one song of this CD into their ipods. Three of them already bought their copy
It was good.  There are so many albums like this.  This is one of the good ones
This is an amazing EP - one of Boards of Canada's strongest to date. Honestly, I didn't enjoy Dayvan Cowboy that much on Campfire Headphase, but since it has been recontectualized on Trans Canada Highway, I'm a huge fan of the song. The new tracks are more like what one would typically expect from Boards of Canada. Warm, fuzzy, mellow, lush analogue synths and plenty of them! For those who weren't as taken with the newer BOC sound on Campfire Headphase, assuage your fears - this is definitely a return to the traditional sound. That's not to say though that this is a rehash of old material. One can hear bits and pieces of Geogaddi and such, but the overall feel is much closer to Music Has the Right to Children. To all Boards of Canada fans - buy this without hesitation. It doesn't matter what you thought of Campfire - this is quality.I have one question. The title, Trans Canada Highway, seems to be a fairly obvious reference to Kraftwerk's legendary Trans Europe Express and the album cover seems to point to Kraftwerk's Autobahn album cover, but I don't hear any explicit musical connection. Is Boards of Canada paying a simple titular tribute to Kraftwerk, or is there something else buried within? This calls for repeated listenings
I thoroughly enjoy this collection of hits from The Mamas and the Papas. Every song is fun and the tunes will stay with you long after you're done listening.Like other selections from the 20th Century Masters series, this can't be called a complete collection. However, what is included is fantastic and I find myself popping it into my CD player much more often than many other CDs.My copy of this CD (which I bought new) includes an 8-page folder with two photos of the band (besides the cover photo), a short band biography written by Joseph F. Laredo, and a track listing with song writing and original release credits. Song lyrics are not included. The jewel case is fully transparent with another photo of the band on the inside of the back paper.As a side note, if you are a fan of the ABC television series "Lost" this CD includes the Mama Cass song "Make Your Own Kind Of Music" that is featured on Desmond's record player in the hatch.If you're just starting with The Mamas and the Papas, or simply want a brief overview of some of their better known songs, this is a great CD.For more The Mamas and the Papas, check out Criterion's phenomenal DVD release of Monterey Pop (or the box set The Complete Monterey Pop Festival). This concert DVD is absolutely brilliant, and includes several songs from The Mamas and the Papas.
Those who liked Suede may be looking for more of the same from The Tears, but despite the obviously recognisable vocals from Brett, and the familiar wailing of Bernard's guitar, this marks a watershed in their repertoire. The most obvious difference is that all the songs seem to have been crafted as 'hits' (much more radio-friendly, and why not?). It's also a more mellow sound than Suede (there were fewer opportunities for vigorous bouncing and hand-clapping at the Tears concert I attended). Another important difference is the guitar work, with Bernard soaring off into sonic highs not experienced since Reeves Gabrels and Tin Machine. Among the better songs are Apollo 13, Brave New Century, Refugees and Co-Star. Though Brett and Bernard are capable of better, this is a shot in the arm for us disenfranchised Suede-heads, and I recommend you turn it up loud
I was in Walmart's electronic area (which is where you can usually find me!) and I saw the album. I heard Unbelieveable and I was sold on that song but couldn't find the single. The album on first listen was not my favorite, but after a while I started liking it. It is a great album and I'm glad I bought it. Talent is a virtue!
This is one of my favorites of 2004.  You got a seasoned vet of an MC rockin over some of the illest producers in underground hip hops beats(madlib, j-zone, dangermouse) and some pretty nice guest appearances.  I have a couple of complaints on this album though, like the song "Love Thang", the hook is wack and the beat is corny, another wack hook comes thru on the title track where you got Prince Po sounding Like Tonto from Lone Ranger chanting some indian ish, and on top of that in his rhyme he says some sh*t like "and if the girl farts then she's a pooter"??? thats dumb.  One last complaint then i'm done hatin, but the chorus on Bump Bump is terrible, and i'm embarrased to bump bump that ish when i'm in my car because it sounds so wack, but Raekwon's verse takes me back to when Wu Tang was the untouchable squad they were back in the mid 90's, which more than makes up for the lackluster chorus.  Aside from those complaints you got a dope album, J-Zone hit this up with some of best beats i've ever heard from him.  So pick this up its definitely a good purchase
Sometimes I like to look up and see what I can find on some of my favorite bands from the 70's and Starz being one of them. I was lucky enough to see the band play a few times around 77 and 78. Another band that took time for their fans!!!!!!!I read through the many reviews of posted here on amazon and not sure if there is much that I can add, also great to see that there were so many out there that enjoyed the band and their music. I would recommend reading about each of the Starz cd's and listening to the sound files if available and deciding for yourself........ I remember I liked this cd so much and the logo as well, I even hand- made a stencil and made my own Starz shirt, I think I used some of that gold "glue on glitter" in a tube and had one of the first Starz shirts, before the band even had any if I remember right.Lots of good songs on this cd,  Pull the Plug being one of my favorites both on the LP/CD and live. All good rock songs from a band that deserved a lot more.........I could go on trying to describe the music.......... too bad there are no sound files for this cd....... so you may just have to order it and take a chance. The remaining members have played a few shows during the past year or so and guitar player Richie Ranno continues to be active in the music business, you may even want to go over to starzcentral to get updated	and see what Richie and the band are up to. Singer Michael Lee Smith also had a brother that had his own band and later ventured into Hollywood....... but this is about Starz!!!...So.... I highly recommend checking out the CD's and starzcentral. Not to be confused with the movie channel or another band from Europe that is using the name recently
What an awesome cd... i bought a flogging molly cd as well but dropkick murphy's are better by FAR!
No other compilation of Garland's work exemplifies her genius and versatility than this astounding compilation that shows why she was the entertainment phenomenon that took the world by storm.All her ORIGINAL soundtrack performances are here, sounding magnificent. Far superior to thin-sounding studio re-creations, this is the real deal, assembled with obvious skill, intelligence and dedication to the talented legend.In a sense, this should be the "soundtrack album" for that magnificent documentary about her that PBS produced a while back.Don't pass this up
Many musicians release some sort of experimental album at some point in their career.  For Peter Gabriel, every album is an experiment.  Usually musicians experiment by deviating from the norm; however, on Gabriel's fifth experiment, SO, the ex-Genesis frontman does the exact opposite.  Gabriel, beloved for always doing something different, decided on this album to play it safe - and for Gabriel, that is an experiment.  Previously he was a sort of cult performer, but on SO, Gabriel finally made it into the spotlight.  Big time.  SO was an immense success, peaking at number one on the Billboard Top 100, receiving overwhelmingly-positive reviews (in 2003, So placed 187th on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time), and resulting in a sold-out tour.Which brings us to one nagging term: "sellout".	Though most who loved Peter Gabriel's first four albums loved SO as well, there are still many who call SO Gabriel's sellout album.  To me, that's just foolishness.  Peter Gabriel has never "sold out" and I have no doubt that he never will.  It's clear that on SO he was trying to go in a more mainstream direction, but that's probably the biggest experiment Gabriel has ever undertaken, save for his subsequent release, PASSION.  One popular theory amongst Gabriel fans is that the album's title, SO, is in fact an acronym for "Sell Out" (hence the uppercase capital "S" and the lowercase italicized "o").  I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was.	SO does sound very different from Gabriel's earlier albums (though then again, none of those sounded alike either).  If anything, it resembles Gabriel's third self-titled release, nicknamed MELT.  The thing that really separates those two - other than an obviously more commercial sound on SO - is a feeling of warmth on that album, unlike the harsh, gritty darkness of MELT.  Perhaps that's why listeners found SO so charming.	What does SO have to offer?  Well, a lot.  For one thing, there's the atmospheric opening, "Red Rain", one of Gabriel's finest tracks.  Like many of the tracks on the album, it's dominated by ethereal guitar from David Rhodes and heavenly synthesizers, courtesy of Gabriel himself.  Then there's one of the biggest hits of 1980s (which also spawned what may be the best music video in history), "Sledgehammer," inspired by the motown music Gabriel listened to as a child.  With its pounding, industrial percussion, playful bass (by Gabriel's exclusive bass man, Tony Levin) and clever, sexually suggestive lyrics, it's no surprise that "Sledgehammer" was a hit.  After letting his silly side out, Gabriel tries to inspire with "Don't Give Up", a nice song made great by heavenly vocals from another popular 80s musician, Kate Bush.	The subsequent track, "That Voice Again", is my personal favorite song from this album.  It features some excellent drumming from Manu Katche, an immensely-talented drummer who has also played with artists like Sting, along with misty guitars, delightful synthesizers, and fine lyrics hit home by Gabriel's pained singing.  Like the best tracks on SO, "That Voice Again" manages to be fun, moody, uplifting, powerful, warm, and inspirational, all at once.	Gabriel winds down a little for the dreamy, powerful "Mercy Street", a song inspired by and written about Anne Sexton, an American mental patient who relieved her depression through writing.  As on his previous albums, Gabriel proves that he knows when to lighten up by whipping out "Big Time", a silly but fun track which also spawned an innovative music video.  "Big Time" features heavy drumming from Stewart Copeland, the former drummer of The Police, as well as some awesome CMI by Simon Clark.  "We Do What We're Told (Miligram's 37)" is about the experiments of Yale professor Stanley Milgram.  Milgram would have his subjects administer shocks to actors, who would scream in pain as the shocks became more and more horrible.  Milgram observed that his subjects would do what he told them to do, despite the immense pain they appeared to be inflicting on the actors.  He follows that rather cold song with "This Is The Picture (Excellent Birds)", a tensely surreal tune.	The album closes with one of Gabriel's most famous songs, "In Your Eyes".  Most people are familiar with the song from its usage in Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy masterpiece ... SAY ANYTHING, where the song was used in what has become one of the most famous scenes in movie history.  It's one of Gabriel's warmest and most romantic compositions, and also one of his best.  On the original LP version of SO, "We Do What We're Told" closed out the album.  That's a fine way to end it, but it's also a rather cold way to end such a warm album.  When the album was re-released remastered on CD in 2002, Gabriel placed "In Your Eyes" at the end of the album as he originally intended.  Now that is the way to end it!	So - how does SO rank among the many other brilliant works of Peter Gabriel?  Well, it ranks quite highly, actually.  It's one of the pinnacles of Gabriel's career, though whether it truly is the peak or not is hard to say.  After all, how can one compare Gabriel's albums when they are all so vastly different?  Certainly, though, SO is one of the finest Gabriel masterpieces.  This is fun, well-crafted, emotional music.  SO is SO wonderful.    
The Fisrt cd is alot better than this one, but this one is still okay. I only Liked one song on this disc and it is. Track 4. Will The Circle Be Unbroken/I'll Fly Away/ Jesus Loves Me. Don't get me wrong the music is beautiful, but i think the first one is alot better
Unless you frequented jazz clubs in Baltimore or Philly in the fall of 1955, this would have been your first exposure to the Miles Davis-John Coltrane collaboration (a few tracks recorded for Columbia, the label Miles would soon be joining exclusively, a few weeks before this session weren't issued until much later). Davis settled on Coltrane as his replacement for the departing Sonny Rollins almost by default - no one else fit the bill or new the book. That they would stay together long seemed unlikely because their temperaments differed so much (Davis was a hands-off leader, Coltrane wanted constant  input from Miles on his playing and music in general). STABLEMATES (a Benny Golson tune) is the track that seems to draw the most attention. It's an excellent composition, and although Coltrane sounds somewhat tentative (nervous?), the performance is attractive. But my favorite side is THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE, even though Coltrane sits this one out: Miles plays beautifully, and I love the emotion he wrings from the tune.True, this is an early effort by the group that would transform modern jazz, but it's a very good session nonetheless. The group plays well, the rhythm section is rock solid, and they are all off and running. Full speed ahead
all I want to know is when is the next album going to be released?  I can't wait!  This album is fantastic
This is the best album/band noones ever heard of.This is the most underrated bands EVER ( Including FM Static. ) And they deserve some appreciation. This CD is a great rock CD and it has a bit of seemingly Hip-Hop bits here and there in just about every song. Almost every song on this CD rocks, so BUY IT
EXCELLENT SONGWRITING, GUITAR PLAYING AND OVERDUBBING. ANOTHER LIVE ALBUM FOLLOWING HIS FIRST WITH PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SONGS NOT ON FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS SUCCESSFUL AS COMES ALIVE.  DAYS DAWNING, CRYING CLOWN, FANFARE ARE A FEW SUCH SONGS. A FEW SONGS FROM WIND OF CHANGE, SOMETHING'S HAPPENING, AND EVEN A COUPLE FROM HIS EARLY DAYS WITH THE HERD WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A SECOND SUCCESSFUL LIVE ALBUM RATHER THAN THE I'M IN YOU ALBUM WHICH WAS A TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT
Martina McBride's "Emotion" album contains many pop country elements, but is still nonetheless a great album. Here's how I rate each song. (out of a 5 star scale)1) Do What You Do- good song, but takes a little to get used to.(4 stars)2) Anything's Better than Feeling the Blues- good songs, good lyrics. (4 stars)3) I Love You- great song, Martina's most successful song on the country charts, spending 5 weeks in the top spot. (5 stars)4) Make Me Believe- great song about whether one's love is true or not.... i love the lyric "but it's hard to start a fire without a spark (5 stars)5) Love's the Only House- this song will draw a strong connection to your heart. The song is spectacular and speaks the truth... love is TRULY the only house big enough for all the world's pain. The video to this song is very touching as well. Go Martina! (5 stars)6) There You Are- a perfect wedding song... She hold the "are" note for at least 12+ seconds near the end. (5 stars) If you hear this song LIVE, she holds the note 15 seconds!!!! (so LIVE this song will be 6 stars/5 stars!!!!)7) It's My Time- the first song that I ever heard Martina perform live in the AMA awards... she rocked the house down with this song... She also holds a 10 second note at this song. Love that range of hers. (5 stars)8) I Ain't Goin' Nowhere- I like this song and its message about being there for a significant other. (5 stars)9) Anything and Everything- the lyrics and Martina's gentle vocal performance on this song are perfection. (5 stars)10)From the Ashes- another standout song on this album. She holds some high notes in this one too. (5 stars)11) Goodbye- a solid performance, I llike how Martina goes lower and softer in some parts of the song. (4 stars)12) This Uncivil War- the best song on the album!!!! AMAZING!!!! Written by Gretchen, the writer of Martina's career hit "Indepedence Day." A very emotional song, which defines the title of the album. The ending is a real treat as well. (6 stars!)This album is definitely worth purchasing!!! It helps complete my collection of Martina's albums
The title says it all, Im so happy I bought it and I listen to it all the time :
I bought this cd since my sister had stolen my original copy, lol. Need I say more
Sweet brazillian jazz piano combined with Guaraldi's 1960's hit Cast Your Fate to the Wind. Throw in a coupla classics like Since I Fell For You and Moon River masterfully interpreted by Vince and you have the perfect album for unwinding, loving, or waking up
ALways loved this group....own several of their CD's and this is by far my favorite.  Darryl Hall's phrasing of his songs are superb.
I agree with everyone else; the music on this album is completely magical. Two masters at work with a great rhythm section, very spontaneous-sounding contrapuntal harmonies, unbounded joy in every tune, and some interesting arrangements.This is also the worst-sounding CD (or LP, for that matter) that I have ever heard. It sounds worse than lo-res MP3s played over the Web; I have recordings of 78s that sound better. I cannot believe that even Laserlight would release this. I have other Laserlight Cds and none of them sound this bad. If they remastered this and made it sound better, I would buy it again. That's the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5.Still, it's worth getting if you can listen past the horrible sound quality
I am a latecomer to the works of Chopin, unqualified to comment on Dinu Lipatti's technique and interpretation, but this recording gives an interesting framework to explore the waltzes. They are numbered 1 through 14 in order of opus publication, but on this disc Lipatti shuffles them to form a cycle of his own devising. There are four waltzes in the key of A flat and it seems one challenge was to space them across the recital. Contrast this to Alexandre Thaurad's CD where he clumps like-key waltzes into groups. (He also adds five more posthumous works.)Most of Chopin's waltzes start on the dominant, meaning either the fifth note of the home key (the tonic, the I), or a dominant seventh chord (V7) which leads to the tonic. Lipatti uses this feature to string together his cycle. If, for instance, there were a waltz that ended on a C natural it could easily bring us to Waltz No 4, which starts on an insistent C7 chord before rising to the home key of F major. I will use this as the starting point for tracing the harmonic relationships of the tracks on this CD.Track 1: Waltz No 4 in F, "Grande Valse brillante" - as noted starts on the V7 and finishes on F in octaves.Track 2: No 5 in A flat - begins on a trilling dominant Eb, but the note it trills up to is an F (which ended the previous track). Finishes with a parting shot, a turn in the bass ending on Ab.Track 3: No 6 in D flat, "Minute Waltz" - starts on Ab; the contour of the opening phrase echoes the gesture of the previous parting shot as well. Ends in Db.Track 4: No 9 in A flat - has two pick up notes then hits a Db on the downbeat of the first measure. The right hand ends on the Ab above middle C.Track 5: No 7 in C sharp minor - starts on a G sharp above middle C, which is the same black key (enharmonic equivalent) of the previous Ab. Ends in C# minor.Track 6: No 11 in G flat - starts with a pick-up turn then hits the downbeat with a Db (enharmonic C#). Ends on a Gb in the treble clef.Track 7: No 10 in B minor - starts quietly on the same note, an F# (enharmonic Gb). Ends with a soft B in the bass clef.Track 8: No 14 in E minor - first note is the exact same B in the bass. Ends in E minor.Track 9: No 3 in A minor - starts on an E in the bass melody. Ends in A minor; keep in mind that minor third of this key is a C natural -- you can hear it in the melody of the third to last measure.Track 10: No 8 in A flat - this is a side-stepping change of keys, but there is an harmonic link to the previous waltz. Instead of starting on the dominant, this one begins on the major third -- C natural.Track 11: No 12 in F minor - starts on the dominant -- C again. Toggle back and forth between tracks 10 and 11 and you will hear that these two waltzes start on the exact same pitch. Instead of ending in F minor this waltz closes in the relative major of Ab. The last three notes are a rise and fall, Bb-C-Ab.Track 12: No 13 in D flat - there is a leading note before the dominant. The first three notes (Bb-Ab-F) fall and rise in a mirroring gesture to the final phrase of the previous. Ends quietly in Db.Track 13: No 1 in E flat, "Valse brillante" - another side-stepping key change but there is a connection. If you toggle between tracks 12 and 13 you will hear the same initial note, a Bb -- quietly in the former, boldly here. Finishes resoundingly in the tonic Eb.Track 14: No 2 in A flat, "Grande Valse brillante" - introduction in the dominant chord, Eb7. Closes in Ab. From here you could loop around to the beginning of the cycle again, linking the major third (C natural) to the V7 that starts the F major waltz
Live Alive is good enough to buy in my standered's.....I really think this was recorded poorly but the songs on it are really good if you play it in your car, or on bigger speakers so you can really hear everything much better. Their are many good songs included on this complination of live performence's spanning from performences from Montreux Jazz Festival, Austin Opera House,and the Dallas Starfest. This recordings are all from 85-through 86. Jimmie Vaughan appears on Willie The Wimp, Love Struck Baby, Look At Little Sister, and Change It playing guitar, and string bass. I think the worst song on the entire complination is Voodoo Chile(slight return) which is kind of weird for me to say because I think that was truely the best song Stevie Ray played live but in this case its not. Other than that I really think for what it is it's a average live performence.
Just wanted to answer Reviewer:"homedecaramel" and his question as to who Melissa refers to from the song titled' "Melissa's Garden".Melissa was the daughter of close friends of Steve Vai.She passed away 5 years ago at a fairly young age due to ovarian cancer.  Melissa's parents built a beautiful garden as a remembrance of her.  Melissa had a wonderful spirit and her spirit lives on as is apparent in Steve's beautiful tribute and in Melissa's Garden.  
From the manic whirlwind Prelude to the shocking Cake and Sodomy, Portrait of an American family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable. Cake and Sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures, Lunchbox is told with a twist of humor, Organ Grinder is pleasing vocally, Cyclops is addictingly wild, Get your gunn is catchy (if not overly insulting), Dope Hat is great and fierce, and My Monkey is hysterically enjoyable. Snake Eyes and Sissies is another winner, easy to get lost in. The rest all work to varying degrees, though not as appealing. Every song on this album is worth listening to, from fast paced and rock style to techno overload.
i love to working with this soundtrack in the back ground. the music is fun, whimsical, and out of the ordinary.i like pop and rock, but sometimes you just need good music without the lame lyrics
This album was released in the summer of '86 when Queen's radio airplay was at a rather low point in the U.S. and at a very high point in Europe.By now,the band had adventured into pop genres beyond rock,yet colouring their songs with their distinctive style of interpretation and playing.Here we find the gorgeous ballad ONE YEAR OF LOVE and the catchy FRIENDS WILL BE FRIENDS.The ominous anthem WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER and the Highlander themed PRINCES OF THE UNIVERSE are gems in this crown.The first two USA singles, the rocker ONE VISION (from Iron Eagle)and the danceable A KIND OF MAGIC barely cracked the US Top 40 in a decade when alternative music was preferred and classics were often overlooke
If you want a feel good,come home from work and forget your day CD you found it her
Paul Hardcastle is a member of a select groupof Smooth Jazz artists that makes the format "work".I was in radio and that format and also a Music Director for a former Buffalo, NY FM Smooth JazzRadio Station. (WSJZ 92.9
Bought this CD for my daughter, a new Bill Withers fan and she loved the whole collection! It's a great compilation of classic Bill Withers music
stephen stills "for what it's worth" is, of course, a classic song. "burned," neil young's strongest effort for this album, is another classic song. the rest of it is all very good. i would say that it does sound a bit dated, however;, and that this one is mostly for fanatics of 60's music. your average "artic monkeys" fan is not going to find this a good match for their musical sensiblities. better was on the way from buffalo springfield. their next album, "buffalo springfield again" is an all out rock masterpiece that everybody should own, whatever your age or inclinations.
Another great album by Firehouse. My favorites are Reach for the sky, When I look into your eyes, and hold your fire. I have other favorites, but there are my top 3. I have a story to go along with this album, ladies and gentlemen. See, I was heading to Cross-Country one day, for the huge "Group 2" meet. (There's a section, and 5 groups from every section make it, and there were four sections, so you can make the calculations). I listened to this album, having a bad day before, and having a bad night of rest. Listening to this album, I got a river of positivity, and I had a great start and a great finish. I ended up smashing my last personal best in Cross-Country. Basically ladies and gentlemen, this cd has alot of effect. Get it.I love to review things. Have a great day
The Dead were primarily a live road band, but on this and the other great album from 1970 (American Beauty)the band proved their mettle in the studio, moving into less spacey territory. The music reflects their range, from country and bluegrass to folk, blues and rock. Superb.ps. their early studio effortsAnthem..., Aoxomoxoa) were also noteworthy experiments, but the music wasn't as powerful as the live interpretations
Sing of Mary is a work of art! The beauty of the music is only surpassed by the Woman it praises...Mary! God Bless this CD..
but not the only one you should get.  Make this a purchase, but get live/dead also because it has all different songs, and then look at other live releases.  The dead have a lot of good recordings, just pick and choose among them.  This one has become a staple of great dead songs in my collection.  It is amazing how many good songs they have, and how intimidating it seems to get their best stuff, but you can't go wrong with this release even though some people feel it isn't up to scratch
Engelbert Humperdinck `s name has remained for almost five decades in the great musical stages. In Spain there is a term that fits so well to describe his magnetism: Duende.He shone with radiant intensity in the Age of the great crooners, the most difficult, indeed: Frankie, Tony Bennet, Andy Williams, Dean Martin, Matt Monroe, Bobby Vinton, Booby Goldsboro, Glenn Campbell, O.C. Smith, Otis Reading, Pat Boone, Kenny Rogers,  Paul Anka and Neil Diamond (from time to time) among the most remarkable ones.    His peculiar style has deserved him the best acknowledgments all over the world. His multifacetic repertoire and elegant voice confers him presence and conviction every time he appears on stage.His name is now a legend. Go for this admirable collection, you will enjoy it over and over
We are using this series of CDs in our homeschool music program - they are fantastic!   We especially love this one about Bach - what an awesome man!   The story of his life is told in a way that is very interesting and holds the children's attention while also using various pieces of his music in the narration.  It is done VERY well!   My children are gaining a tremendous amount of knowlege and appreciation for music through this CD and so are my husband and I
I got the LP version of this album as a Christmas present in 1988. I immediately fell in love with it. She sings about issues such as unemployment and poverty which were rampant during the Reagan years ("Talkin about a Revolution", "Fast Car"). But she offered hope that things would get better as we approached the 90s, which they did. "Mountains O Things" was about the materialsim of the 80s. Other issues she covers are racism ("Across the Lines") and domestic abuse ("Behind the Wall"). Even though this album is almost 20 years old it does not sound dated, as the messages are just as relavent today as they were in 1988.I bought the CD version in 1992 and I never get tired of listening to it. All of the songs are good but my favorite ones are "Talking about a Revolution", "Fast Car", "Baby Can I Hold You", "Mountains of Things", "Why" and "For My Lover".
This is the type of music to sit down, relax, put on a pair of headphones and let it absorb your concious. From spacey sounding electronics to soft vocals over piano to heart pounding rhythms to skittering percussion...this is just a taste of what is Supersilent, and from what I hear it is all improvised which blows my head clean off. All this coming from someone who has never heard them before...talk about a great buy! Highly, highly recommended, I close my eyes, to awaken among the cosmos traveling without a tangible body, drunk with the infinite beauty, I sigh without a mouth and think..
Really, this is only worth 4 stars if you can appreciate all things cheesy. This is, of course, funny stuff. Really, it's the kind of music where you don't want other people to know you're listening to it, but oh my is it fun!This one has all the ingredients of your typical yngwie-inspired power metal-album: soaring guitars, high-pitched vocals, double-bass drumming, a lot of neoclassical stuff (essentially the sound of Mozart, Bach and Beethoven, just way less complex) both on the keyboards and the guitars. And of course, trumpets and brass. Oh, how I loathe and love the sound of trumpets and brass on a keyboard. Cheese, cheese, cheese all the way!If you've heard ANY rhapsody-material before, a song-by-song breakdown is pretty unnecessary as you'll know exactly what to expect. They really did benefit from the better production on their next album (not to mention their latest opus!) but Legendary Tales doesn't sound bad by any means, and the songwriting is solid and pretty diverse. It's just cheesy, REAL cheesy! And truth be told, since it's a metal album the guitars could use a little more 'oomph' here and there. This is more happy metal than heavy metal, but then again, they're singing about mystical lands and holy creatures, so Behemoth-like heavy guitars wouldn't really fit. We don't wanna scare our Warrior of Ice now, do we
There have been innumerable Motorhead collections over the years, but this is one of the few that attempts to mix old with the new. On this collection, all the classics are present, and some newer material is thrown in as well. Unfortunately, there are some throw-away tracks, mainly the Girlscool and Headgirl tracks. (To be honest, these tracks are pretty much worthless.) Some live tracks are meshed in and fit well, and the newer songs help to add some variety to the old-scool stuff.I would recommend this collection to listeners looking to get a nice, cheap collection of some of Motorhead's best just for the sake of getting into the band. But if you're wanting the prime collection of older material, save up some extra dough and buy "No Remorse" or "Stone Deaf Forever.
Aretha's voice, her style, delivery and interpretation of her music is incomparable. These songs are more than just classics; they're a songbook to millions of people's lives who grew up listening to her in the 60's and 70's as I did. They evolk memories of times that changed our world, and showed just how powerful and influential music could be for generations to come. There is not much that came before, and very little that came after these golden years for Aretha, that can compare to this treasury of her music. Sadly the Aretha Frankiln of 2007 pales in comparison to the Aretha Franklin of this time, who was truly and rightfully The Queen of Soul.
This 1989 debut album from this Texas sleaze metal outfit is chocked full of great vocals from Jason McMaster,catchy guitar riffs,and generally a collection of feel good tunes about getting drunk and having a good time.It fits quite nicely in my CD collection in the " D" column next to the Dirty Looks CD.I thought "Scared" was the best song on here along with the opener,"Teasin Pleasin" and "Queen of the Nile" but I liked all of them.The best way to describe Dangerous Toys is that it has a heavy Guns N Roses sound with a poppier edge to it.It's too bad they never made a good album after this one and Dangerous Toys would never get to this level again.If you want late 80's hard rock/metal without the spandex and the makeup,this debut album is highly recommended.Nothing fancy,just good old fashioned rock and roll
In Temporary Secretary theres a great melody struggling to escape from the Space Invaders backing.Memo to Paul-turn this into a ballad for your next albumBogey Music,inspired by a book,is quite interesting.Waterfalls is the standout song and Comin'Up was the hit.The rest you just get used toWhat more could you ask
This CD is well worth buying. But to you blues aficionado's who rely on Shaq's recommendations, let me put it in terms you'll understand. Coco is no SRV, or an Albert, or a Buddy. He's definitely a large step below them. But he is also not a lounge singer type like Smokin Joe Kubek, Lil Ed and the Blue Imperials, etc. Coco, is a large step above them. This CD seems to pick up steam with each song.  He shows his flexibility with different types of guitar playing on a number of songs. He performs a great ballad, with a Johnny Copeland, song (#6), that's 5 minutes and 59 seconds long. (I could have said 6 minutes, but Shaq don't fool around when it comes to da blues!) NEW, GOOD BLUES IS HARD TO FIND, and till "Jumping Joe" Bonamassa dedicates more of his recordings to true electric blues, this is one of the best of the last year, along with Walter Trout's "Full Circle"
Beres has done it again. This is a great CD. I can actually say that enjoyed all 19 tracks
i do not own this CD, but i recently saw the doctor at a local jazz club and was blown away. He had a good sense of humor and was very worldly. He would ascend and spiral upwords untill every one in the club's heart rate had spead up 100 notches... and BOOM... he was back to being relaxed old lonnie. at the break i met him, and got an autograph. He was very insightful musical and with spoken words.I would reccomend seeing him live, aswell as buying his album
I've always liked Tevin Campbell, he had a beautiful voice and really did it on "Break it Down". I particularly like Break it Down, Shhh, Brown Eyed Girl among others.. Excellent CD overall. 
I don't own this CD. I don't have to own it to review it, because this music is the soundtrack of my high school years. I lived this music. I listened to it while cruising the local shopping center indulging in - er - various activities. Half of the bands on this CD I had the privilege of seeing perform live in the 70s. THIS is what FM radio sounded like back then. Every single song on this CD was well known to me and my friends. Yes, even Black Oak Arkansas (hot and nasty!), Nazareth (get Hair of the Dog CD for more), and the Runaways (hot babes!). Oh, and I love the movie too. Party on, dudes
the willie dixon chess set is a window into the early bluesthat was the basis for some of the most well known rock androll songs of all time. from led zeppelin to the kinks willie dixon and his music was a source of inspiration and musical reinvention. sometimes you have to stay true to your roots. itsan incredible journey into the heart of original blues
No collection of blues/rock is complete without A Piece of Your Soul.  There very simply is not a weak track on the entire disc.  From the raunchy (Bitter Rain) to the uplifting (Good Day For The Blues) to the bittersweet (Cynical) to the soft (Share That Smile) Storyville encompasses the entire range of musical expression with a style that is as provocative as it is unique.  Put this disc on your list of music to have on a deserted island
This is tha best master p album this and the movie this came out when I was and the 6 grade to lisen to this it's emosional to me it reminds me of back n da day friends I knew all that my favrite song is mama raised me it gots bone,snoop,e-40 all no limit all them it's a great album you can lisen to it most the way though it's a great album gansta classic you gotta get this
I had this album for many years when I was younger. I had looked for alongtime to try and find it on CD with no luck.  I finally found it on Amazon. This is my favorite christmas album,  I even have my teenage daughter hooked on it now. The caroling medely is awesome and My daugher loves the Pinecones and Hollyberries song.  No one should be without thisCD in their Christmas Collection. 
Since Sunset Boulevard is one of my favorite films, I bought the London cast album long before the musical came to America.  Patti LaPone is the ultimate Broadway star, having created the role of Evita. Her soaring versions of "As If We Never Said Goodbye", and "With One Look" are unmatched. Her power and vocal range soar! All of Norma's songs had to be drastically reduced in vocal range to accomodate Glen Close's lack of, (or nonexistent) singing ability. In fact, this DVD was unavailabe to the American market during the American run of the musical and was literally pulled from the shelves. Perhaps ALW didn't want the American audience to hear the masterwork of this production.  Kevin Anderson, a brilliant actor, does not have the operatic quality of Alan Cambell in the U.S. cast, but he portrayed Joe Gillis with far more guts and passion.  This is not for the lover's of Oklahoma of Showboat, but for lovers of more contemporary musicals, this one is perfect
Jock Rock is a must for anyone in the fitness business.  Nothing gets a crowd hopping like a little James Brown!  Not much for listening to, but a good collection when your looking for just the right song to play for a certain event
this album was by far the bands most daring ablum. they went away from the classic INXS sound that made them superstars (Kick, X) and instead updated their sound to fit the time. like a previous reviewer noted, this was when grunge was becoming very popular in the US, and unfortunately, caused this album to go unnoticed for the most part. its sad too, cuz there are many solid tracks, inlcuding Heaven Sent (my favorite), Not Enough Time, Baby Dont Cry and Beautiful Girl. I have recently become a big fan of INXS and have purchased all of their albums. I like this one in particular because it is different from all their other albums. I recommend "Welcome" to any INXS fan and any other fan of great music
This is a great CD!  Each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end.  This makes it nice to just play the entire CD or to loop one track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another.  So far the Car and Washing machine tracks seem to be our baby's favorites.  When she outgrows the need for this white noise CD, we'll transition her to lullaby or classical music.  For now though, this CD helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap times.  As a bonus, the Waves and Rain on the Roof tracks are soothing for grown-ups needing to drown out noise while they sleep
As a band, The Byrds are one of the greatest and certainly one of the most influential bands in rock and roll history.  Adding to that legacy, "Mr. Tamborine Man's" status as one of the greatest debut albums in rock history is almost without question.  This band could do it all; country, folk, rock, jam, psychedelica, etc, etc.  And this debut was perhaps the pinnacle of their achievements.  Though they would venture into much more adventurous territory ("Notorious Byrd Brothers"), this was where the band was the most solid, the most tight collectively.Dylan's influence is everywhere from the get-go; 4 of his songs span the album, including the title track which the Byrd's turned into his only #1 hit.  Elsewhere, there are two other covers, but the songs with the best longevity are originals, mostly penned by Gene Clark.  Witness the tortured romance of "I'll Feel a Whole lot Better" and "Here Without You" and tell me he wasn't a great songwriter.  Roger McGuinn (or Jim, if you like) was quick about finding his signature nasally croon that would go on to influence Tom Petty, among others.  Obviously, not everyone had found their place; songs by Chris Hillman and David Crosby are nowhere to be found.  But "Mr. Tamborine Man" stand today every bit as tall as the early works of Dylan and the Beatles.  This is the album that set the standard for folk-rock from then on, from Buffalo Springfield to REM to Toad the Wet Sprocket to the most current emo bands.Overall:  10 out of 10
While Volume 1 of the DREAM BABES series is more accessible with its very girly girl group pop, sun-shiney vocals - Volume 2 offers a little bit of everything - from pop r, girl group vocals, pop, swinging pop  even some very early school grrl rock 'n roll - they might be a little more lyrically serious (hence the subtitle REFLECTIONS) but if anything, that's a good thing. It's nice to hear that women were trying different styles and genres and not just singing about about boys ...And also know - these are not just timepieces to be admired from a distant - these are all still fun, interesting and downright cool to hear again or for the first time. If you're a collector, this whole series should be on your checklist
What can be said about this album?This is one of those albums that re-invigorates your faith/enthusiasm in music (those who listen to a lot of albums know what I mean).Some tracks from here were most famously covered by Nirvana on their unplugged album, although pained I don't think Cobain quite got the feel that Kirkwood gives to these songs.It has a perfect blend of songs that make you want to almost hoe-down and those that you can just reflect on and chill out.Particular stand outs on this album are Split Myself In Two, Magic Toy Missing, Aurora Borealis and The Whistling Song.This album does take some growing as Kirkwood's voice is abrasive, but this is an album that will truly make you love music.Do try it, you won't be disappointed.
This is a wondrful CD and quite a bargin. Two discs and the very best of Nancy Wilson. I liked so much, I bought two and gave one to a friend
I remember listning to this album over and over again when I was young. To this day I still can't get these awesome songs out of my head! A must get album for you Old School folks or anyone that enjoys great music
very interesting CD. Some of the vocals are distracting, but the music is driving modern psychadelia. As I said, think Syd Barrett's Floyd mixed w/ Melt Bannana. I highly recommend
Pablo is definitely the Babe Ruth/Moses of these pieces. However, tempo, cadence, clarity, consistency and emotional projection are much better here. Starker is at least the Michael Jordan of the Bach Suites. -And compared to Pablo (I heard the Naxos one) the sound quality on this disc is The Right Hand Of God. Starker is the dog's balls; big ones, like a Great Dane.
As always, opinions vary in terms of who is the master at recording timeless pieces of music such as these Bach cello suites.  Starker himself pronounced in the sleeves of this CD that this edition, the 4th recordings of these music by himself is not "technically perfect", but in many ways, his most mature interpretation. You can spend hundreds trying to find a Mercury copy of "the perfect" rendition; or you can appreciate the little imperfections of an aged artist, at the height of his humanistic understanding of music, and of life.
This is a wonderful Vangelis album and is fairly energetic, with enough experimental flourishes to keep the listener fully engaged.   Released in 1975, Heaven and Hell incorporates a full choir into the Vangelis sound. Vangelis played all of the instruments on this album including synthesizers, electric piano, acoustic piano, a full drum kit, and percussion.  Vangelis is joined by the English Chamber Choir (conducted by Guy Protheroe) with Vana Veroutis as the lead female vocal, in addition to Jon Anderson (vocals/lyrics on Heaven and Hell (Part 1 So Long Ago, So Clear).  Vangelis is quite a good musician and really shines on the acoustic piano. As a huge Yes fan, I was delighted to hear Jon's excellent voice and cosmic lyrics.  As far as the inclusion of the choir goes, I did not mind it that much and felt that it added a very interesting textural element to the recording.The Heaven and Hell suite is divided into two lengthy movements including Part I (21'58") and Part II (21'16").  In general, the first part is more orchestral in nature and features the choir and excellent acoustic piano playing by Vangelis.  Another general observation is that the first movement mixes vigorous sections that feature drums with spacey and haunting synth-dominated passages.  Of course, my favorite part comes at the end of Part I, which is the 4'58" section with Jon on vocals.  This short "song" is quite moving and uplifting.  Movement II is a little darker and more experimental than the first movement and is my favorite of the two.  The choir is featured on the second movement, along with a beautiful wordless vocal by the very talented Vana Veroutis.  Part II closes with a very spacey and quiet synthesizer section, which provides excellent contrast with the preceding thunderous percussion section.All in all, this is a good Vangelis album and is recommended along with Albedo 0.39 (1976); Spiral (1977); and the excellent Opera Sauvage (1979)
Coming from a listener with a broad scope of musical preferences, Blues has always been a multi-faceted genre which can be broken down into the categories:Soulful Blues, Drinking Blues and Guitar Blues. "B.B King - Live At The Regal" is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all three.This recording is dear to my heart as I can remember far back as first or second grade when my grandmother (God Bless) used to play this on 8-track. She used to love herself some Riley "Blues Brother" King. This recording ALWAYS seemed to be in the player when my cousins and I would come over to visit and rest assured, You WILL hear it before you left to go home.At that time, Being the young naive kid that I was, I remember saying that I hated it and that it was old folks music. All grown up now, In an age where real music is practically unheard of in terms of what these young artists of today release on CDs, I have a newfound respect for real stuff like this. So instead of sitting around burning your brain cells trying to understand what this new generation is calling itself creating, You have decided to come to one of the first sources for good old fasioned real music....The Blues.In my opinion, "BB King Live At The Regal" is one of Mr. King's best recordings and with myself not being a big fan of live albums, This is one of those rare live pieces that captures the essence of what a live recording should sound like. Maybe not so much in terms of the musicianship but the overall performance of those involved. The arrangements were put together nicely  the musicians were all in a very tight vibe on this album and whoever was on the mixing board did an excellent job of capturing this essence. BB's pickin' and crooning mixed with the superb playing by the band make this a wonderful place to start for the blues or BB King enthusiast. It sounds as if it was made in a tasteful nightclub full of grown people who wanted to hear good music while having a good time. The ladies were screaming and the gentlemen were cheering and BB was playing at his best. The only gripe I have about this disc is that it is very short; which was typical considering the age and time that it was made but still essential and a solid lesson for anyone interested in Blues (especially Blues Guitar). I recommend getting this and BB's "Live In Cook County Jail". They both are live albums and both have some of the same songs on them but they were done in a different way and should still be heard.Good choice if you get this one.  
Nobody captures the spirit and essence of a city at night like New York City's own Ultrablue. The group is the brainchild of keyboardist/producer John Smatla and jazz guitarist Dave Stryker, who bring in an NYC all-star cast of players in addition to their impressive band ensemble to create a sophisticated and evocative musical mood. ULTRABLUE is the latest outing for Ultrablue, and the first release on 215 Records. The project drips of chill, smooth jazz, and rich, rhythmic textures that will keep the project in replay mode for a good while in your car and home players and on your iPod. Special guests include singer/saxophonist Pete Belasco, trumpet/flugelhorn player Randy Brecker, female vocal group, Allure, flutist Nestor Torres and Brazilian vocalist Gabriella Anders. From the sexy saunter, "Guilty Pleasures" and the spicy and sultry, "Indiscretions," to the scintillating "Soul Candy," ULTRABLUE provides such a cool groove and flow that it really does lend itself to be the perfect soundtrack to a night out or in (for that matter). Pete Belasco is featured on the sensual cover "The Summer Knows" while Nestor Torres livens things up on the groove, "Jungle Fever," and the delicious Gabriela Anders delivers an alluring vocal on "Destiny." The project's first single, "Shiver," is already attracting radio airplay from coast to coast... We expect big things from Ultrablue on this and all of their future releases. This is the new standard of Smooth Jazz. ~SANDY SHOR
I bought this Cd yesterday and I immediatly knew it was going to rock! After hearing the title track,Go!, I knew this Cd was going to be different then the Spice Girls Cds. It is better. My favorite songs are Never Be The Same Again,Ga Ga,and Goin Down.
I have listened to the cuts from this CD and was amazed at how quickly it  transported me back to the time.  There were several tracks that I was  delighted to see since the artists were not popular enough to have an  entire album re-released.  If you are in a mood for a good dose of  nostalgia, this is the set for you!
Studio album released in 1971, by the original band-a real band with Alice Cooper, Neal Smith, Dennis Dunaway, Michael Bruce, and Glen Buxton. I think the other band members (apart from Cooper), got the short end of the stick. This album, along with these 'Love it to death', 'Billion dollar babies', and 'Love it to death' are so vastly superior to 'his' other albums. The band plays and writes really well together as a 'real' band. Case in point, listen to 'Dada' from a few years later-dreadful! Just wish he had kept a proper band together, even if he fealt that they were not as musically good as some of the late session musicians. Rock is about feel, more than technique in my opinion. I can't even listen to 'Dada' or
I'm not sure about all that other nonsense the reviewer before me is talking about (sounds like someone with an axe to grind)but this album is a stunning piece of workmanship. The music is inspired, the melodies transcending, and the emotion - deep and meaningful. As far as "copying Yanni" goes, well - I don't agree, in fact, Yanni is far more generic and less inspired. The sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact NOT the same nor, are they Yanni's creation. I write this review to commend mr farish on his work, and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and couldn't resist his own urge to see his "critique" in print. Ryans music is distinctly his own, no question - and any similarities are tonal, and not compositional - which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of. As far as I'm concerned, you be the judge - and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve's and websites for music to criticize - and well, make themselves feel a little better. Personally, I would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong songs with great production and uplifting energy. All the other stuff is for hacks! enjoy this music! I do.
An outstanding compilation of a wide variety of popular and regional styles from across Mexico.  This set examines both traditional and contemporary music, including a brilliant ska-banda mix by the popular rock en espanol band, Cafe Tacuba.  Rancheras, corridos, boleros, indie rock and various stylistic fusions are represented, and even a few sones from Veracruz -- one of my favorite musical genres!  If you are curious about the rich musical heritage of this large but often slighted nation, then check this collection out... It might open more than a few new musical doors
Now I know what you're thinking, why are there two releases of "XX"?  Well after they switched from Eclipse to Universal records they re-released the album "XX" but they also re-recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals (BIG MISTAKE!)  The original album is by far much better than the Universal release in December of 2001.  If you're not sure which one to go with GO WITH THIS ONE!
Anybody know the name of the song played at the very end of the movie, when the brother and the sister are saying goodbye to each other, when she is crying and asking him what he is going to do with his life? Right before he enters the bus... I would LOVE to listen to it again but I can't find it anywhere..
This is a CD that one can listen to countless times. The virtuoso playing and beautiful tone produced by Michael aptly display the characteristics of the euphonium. The selections are for college and graduate level players,  as well as the occasionally gifted highschooler. A must hear,  and a must buy
Robbie's flow corses through your veins causing a feeling of total ecstacy and rejuvination. To have a CD that has the power to lift your spirit and your soul is something I feel so honored to have in my possesion. Hats off to Robbie
Much improved voice, same great guitar. Slow album, especially on his two remakes. Country sound on No Reason To Cry (beautiful solo). This CD would have been a 6 stars had he mixed in a thunderstorm to the background of Gonna Rain Today
'Live Etc' is an absolute must-have compilation for all true Gong fans.It features a total of fifteen live tracks of tunes that originally appeared on the band's key albums 'Camembert Electrique','Flying Teapot','Angel's Egg' and 'You'.Taken from unreleased live soundboard tapes(I assume)from shows between 1973-75.Absolute best cut here is "Where Have All The Flowers Gone?" along with "6/8 Tune",that are the disc's only unreleased material.Other cosmic gems include "Dynamite/I Am Your Animal","Isle Of Everywhere","Oily Way" and "Master Builder".Duration is 78:33.Heard they wanted to add the 16th cut that was originally on the 2-lp record,but the CD simply wouldn't hold it.Talk about wanting to give your fans their money's worth.Long live the mother Gong ship!Recommended
I just love lynch mixed with dooms production. It is what real is
This CD reminds me once again why Russian liturgical music is one of the treasures of the world: beautiful, profound, awe-inspiring, uplifting.For the most part, the pieces are well chosen and the performances excellent. I am delighted to see that many of the tracks are from the classic recording of the Rachmaninoff Vespers made in the early 1970s by the USSR Ministry of Culture Chamber Choir directed by Valery Polyansky, and released in the USA by Angel-Melodiya.  I wore out my copy of the LP years ago; although it has been reissued on CD, it's out of print and very hard to find. So it is wonderful to see a generous selection from that recording available on this disk.Listen to track 11, "Praise the Lord O My Soul", sung by the chamber choir and mezzo Irina Arkhipova. You would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved as she sings "Slava Ghospidin" (Praise to the Lord). And listen to how the basses descend to B-flat at end. It just doesn't get any better than this
I saw the Outlaws live twice in the early eighties and had a great time at both shows.  This album is just plain fun to listen to and brings back some very fond memories
I have been hankering after this great album on CD for a long time now. Imagine my surprise to suddenly find out that it is available. Surprise turned to shock when I saw the price. Does the company that produces this CD not realise that are people all around the world (including South Africa where I live) who are very keen on this album? At this stage though, it is only the very wealthy that can afford it.
This is the first cd I've bought in the Liquid Mind series, but after hearing this one, I'll buy more.  The music is calming and soothing; great to fall asleep by which I often do.  It lulls you into a peaceful state of relaxation, letting your mind drift away from the cares of the day.  It makes me think of floating on a cloud.  I would highly recommend this cd for anyone with a busy, stressed-out life. 
Superior to the first Steppenwolf album in many ways, and including a song that tops even 'Born To Be Wild' itself, 'Magic Carpet Ride', is as essential as the group's first album, even to the casual rock fan.It opens with 'Faster Than The Speed Of Life', a perfect blend of Steppenwolfish hard rock  Airplanesque psychedelic rock (like 'She Has Funny Cars').'Tighten Up Your Wing' is an upbeat, bluesy track, that bounces well along, before being replaced with 'None Of Your Doing', a Steppenwolf-classic, that shifts gear between verse  chorus.'Spiritual Fantasy' is one of the strangest creations on the album, strangely touching, though appaling at first. But given a second chance, it comes across as one of the best tracks on the album.The marihuana-anthem 'Don't Step On The Grass, Sam' is pure heavy Steppenwolf, a timeless classic, that crunches slowly, but steadily along.'28' is a great rock song with just a hint of psychedelia in the melody. A neat little rocker that is followed by the ultimate psychedelic dance track.'Magic Carpet Ride' is simply Steppenwolf's best song ever, a fantastic blend of rhytm, melody  vision, that is worth the price of all Steppenwolf's classic albums on its own. It was also the only of their singles to almost replicate 'Born To Be Wild's US #2 placing, when it shot to #3 on the US chart.'Disappointment Number' is almost that, but then not again. It is an odd ode to/parody of old blues, complete with bird sounds in the background, as if it's an old blues singer sitting out in the open.'Lost And Found By Trial And Error' has a great tune, and rocks away well, as does 'Hodge, Podge, Strained Through A Leslie' and 'Resurrection'. Both employ the classic Steppenwolf sound in a great rocking way, to become, if not classics, then at least Steppenwolf-standards.The album closes with 'Reflections' a weird song, that seems like somebody trying to be visionary, before you realize that that is just what he is. Just in a very peculiar way.The album has some, if not weak, then not too powerful spots, but generally it is a more than worthy follow-up to the first Steppenwolf album, with a great blend of the band's traditional hard rock and a form of psychedelia that suits them perfectly. Even the least interesting tracks rock nicely,  no-one should have anything to complain about here..
With all the 'Neuvo Flamenco' and its accompaning popularity. It is nice (and a relief) I might add, to hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form. Not only does this cd contain Sabicas and Nino Ricardo. It also contains four very rare perfomances by Manolo de Huelva. Which are difficult to find anywhere. Also included are Melchor de Marchena performing six pieces. This is truly Pure Flamenco at its best
The ufo space travel theme of Astonomy domine is continued on Let there be more light Saucerful of secrets and Set the controls. Rick wrights two songs are real good Remember a day is one of the best on here. Seesaw has interesting percusson. Corporal Clegg floyds first ww2 song is upbeat Syds song Jugband blues is one of the best early Pink Floyd songs.Saucerful of secerets is a good early Pink Floyd cd it is an important part of Pink Floyds history.
Este CD es excelente! Se los recomiendo a todos los que les guste la musica buena. Robi es un gran poeta y filosofo
I was first touched by Pavarotti's voice as a teenager in the early 80's when I saw a PBS special of this concert on television.  The power of his voice and his personality are incomparable.  His rendition of Ave Maria is especially touching.  I would recommend this as a first buy for anyone who is new to the operatic experience, as I was so many years ago
One of the great metal albums of our time. From the drumming to the guitar alls that can be said is amazing.
I discovered Seal the same way that most people did: through his utterly beautiful song "Kiss From A Rose".  I heard it on the radio one day, and played it constantly for months after that until I finally decided to purchase the album the song was from.  As it happens, the song is from Seal's most revered album, his multi-platinum 1994 self-titled album.  (This is not to be confused with his other self-titled album, his debut, released in 1991.)  I didn't know what to expect when I bought the album, having heard only one song from it, but months after purchasing it I'm glad I made the gamble.I think that the sub-genre which best classifies SEAL is urban.  Urban music, according to All Music Guide, is smooth and polished, often romantic, sometimes uptempo and funky, and features soulful vocals.  SEAL has all of this and more.  It has techno beats, but they're not as overwhelming as one might expect.  They blend together with peaceful, occasionally ethereal guitars and Seal's incredibly soothing singing.  This is, no doubt, stylish music, but first and foremost it's a collection of warm, encouraging songs penned by a very talented musician.  There's nothing that comes close to being a bad song here; there's not even a slightly weak composition.  Thus it's a little harder to pick highlights than usual.  Some highlights include the strong opening track, "Bring It On"; the emotional hit "Prayer For The Dying"; the shimmering "Dreaming In Metaphors"; the upbeat "Newborn Friend"; and, needless to say, the absolutely wonderful "Kiss From A Rose".  The closing track, "Bring It On (Reprise)" is another beautiful song, but "Kiss From A Rose" is possibly the most lovely song I've ever heard.  Listening to it in the warmth of one's home during a snowy December afternoon is an incredibly powerful experience.The message of the album, if there is one, is "Keep on going - life is beautiful!"  It could fail under any other popular artist, but Seal succeeds marvelously.  This is some of the most heartfelt, inspirational singing I've ever heard.  There's a delightful optimism in Seal's singing that sounds strong rather than naiive.  It's hard to feel down after listening to such an uplifting album as this.  Seal is certainly one of the most talented musicians of R (or rock - you decide).  These songs have clear, strong messages, warm, inspirational lyrics, heartfelt, soothing singing, danceable beats, and a whole lot of emotion.Once you've heard "Kiss From A Rose", I guarantee you'll want to pick up the album.  If you're already thinking of doing so, then I encourage you to go forward and buy it; you won't regret it.  It's become one of my favorite albums.  When you're feeling disillusioned or depressed with the state of your life or just life in general, look no further than SEAL to make you cherish it once again.
They may have a new name, but their sound remains the same as before. Mixed with club-friendly beats and laid back drunken-style, the Liks have crafted the perfect party CD. Tracks like Run Wild (possibly the best track on the CD, certainly the most fun to listen to), Sickness (with Butch Cassidy providing some very tight vocals on he hook), and the Neptunes-produced Best U Can showcase The Liks' party appeal, while head-nodders like Bully Foot (with Busta Rhymes) and Another Round create a more relaxed vibe for the listener. The Liks also get outside help from artists like fellow Likwit-Crewmember Defari (My Dear) and Kurupt (the cleverly-titled Promote Violins). Of course, Xzibit holds it down on his two tracks, Bar Code and 151. The only way this Cd differs from their last releases is the instruments, varying from violins (Promote Violins), trumpets (L-I-K-S), and even 40 ounce bottles (40 oz. Quartet skits). The thing you shouldn't expect to find is deep lyrics or dark productions (go grab Mobb Deep). However, copping X.O. Experience could be the best refreshment for this summer's heat. If you like X.O. Experience, check out: Xzibit - Restless, Alkaholiks - Likwidation, Kurupt - Space Boogie, Eastsidaz - Ducez  Trayz
Bireli is not only one of the best living guitar players in gypsy jazz - he is also one of the most creative.  On this album, he gives us a new take on Django's music that is simply stunning.  "Move" has a smaller, more focused sound that it's predecessors, and the addition of the saxophone brings a really fresh twist to this great old music.  Bireli is one of the hottest jazzmen around - this disc is all the evidence you'll need to draw the same conclusion.  Bravo!
This album is just non-stop funky.  I originally got it just because I loved Living In America when I first heard it- but I was pleasantly surprised to find the rest of the cd just as good.  Check out Turn Me Loose  I'm Dr. Feelgood, Let's Get Personal, and Gravity- they're among the best  on the cd
What's more to say about what may be the best "rock" album ever (especially if you consider the "My Kingdom" EP to be the second disc in a two disc set)?  The most emotionally wide-ranging album from one of the best bands ever.  Who else has ever made music like FSOL?  The Beatles and Fripp are the only possible contenders.  I've never heard anything that does a better job of juxtaposing the terrifying and the unbearably beautiful.  If I could pinpoint the one disinguishing feature of all FSOL/AA releases, it would be (as a line in "The Isness" goes) "...[a longing for] inexhaustible ecstasy." It's all the more poignant on this album because of its being interwoven with themes of terror, paranoia and a sense of unrecoverable loss of something without which life isn't worth living.  It sounds hokey, but just opening up the booklet while listening to "Her Face Forms in Summertime" and reading the scrawled message "things are getting f* up round here" makes my eyes a little watery.  My CD developed a 2 second glitch and I just ordered another one--this is so incredible that nothing less than perfection will do.  Just a few points of note: if you're wondering why you spent all that money on your two channel stereo and you haven't heard this album yet, pick it up and turn it up.  I've heard recordings with more bottom end and slam, but none with more depth, nuance and musicality.  I've also found that one of the true tests of a Masterpiece is whether it's possible to really enjoy listening to anything else after its over.  Play Coltrane's "Ascension," Beethoven's String Quartet in A Minor Op. 132, or Bruckner's Ninth and see what I mean.  I played Dead Cities last night and everything to which  I tried to listen sounded hopelessly trivial afterwards.  In the early 80s, a lot of my friends used to speak of The Clash as "the only band that mattered."  At the time, I didn't think any band had mattered all that much since '72.  To my now-much-older ears, FSOL fits that description more accurately than any band to the last 35 years, and this is probably their best work (every single one of them is a desert island disc, however).  One of the very few utterly timeless classics of modern music, and a record that belongs in the collection of anyone with ears.
Quem no gosta de samba, bom sujeito no ,  ruim da cabea ou doente do p...essa letra desse samba serve para definir melhor o cd da marisa monte. Quem no gostar dele,  doente da cabea, do ouvido, do corpo, etc.  um trabalho dedicado, na medida certa para esta cantora, verdadeira diva da mpb. Recomendo a todos.
I received "The Piano" promptly, and in pristine, excellent condition.
a lot of people seem to snub their noses at Let's Talk About Love because it wasn't the career-defining album as the album that preceded it, but all in all, it's still a fantastic snapshot for Celine's career in 1997.Celine shocked almost everyone by releasing a follow-up so shortly (Falling Into You was still in the top 40 on the charts at the time) but it was very worthy.Among my faves on the album include "The Reason", "Immortality" with The Bee Gees (for a "Celine-less" version of the song, check out The Bee Gees' 2-disc hits collection from 2001), "Love Is On The Way", the very funky "Treat Her Like A Lady", "To Love You More" and the beautiful singalong title track.   This album also housed "My Heart Will Go On" which certainly helped push this album to sales over 9 million.   While it was a song that you wanted to smash the stereo at the time because it was being played every five minutes, I'd say enough time has passed that once again you can enjoy and appreciate this beautiful, powerful ballad.With "Falling Into You" and this album, Celine was the #1 female artist for a period, becoming a superstar right as Mariah was abandoning AC for r, as Alanis was going on hiatus for awhile, and when Shania was taking off but hadn't yet exploded into major-superstardom.  Love her or malign her (it seems fashionable to do the latter), she became one of the premier voices in Adult Contemporary and won over a large audience.  I haven't been a fan at all of her last few albums, but if she ever comes back with an album like these two, I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat
This album grabbed my attention from the first measure. Thick and heavy,  this is not like any blues album I've ever heard. Very atypical for Hidalgo  as well. This one is probably an acquired taste- one for the truly hard  core blues fan. The sheer uniqueness grabbed me from the start, and the  more I listen to it, the more I like it. I can only hope there's a Houndog  2 in the works..
I heard The Chairman Dances and went right to Amazon to order this. This ia a lovely little gem of a CD, and it is so pleasing to find John Adams, another great modern American composer. I'm also a fan of composers such as Christopher Rouse, for example, and Joe Leniado Chira is my cousin. Modern composers are a precious resource that we should explore, demand more of and nurture. We afficianados would like to see symphony orchestras and ensembles giving more attention to the modern genre. Meanwhile, John Adams has impressed me with this disc. The Chairman Dances is my favorite. I can just see Chairman Mao doing a vigorous foxtrot to this, and Tricky Dick feeling jealous. This might be the music that opened China to the West
although each track is beautiful in it's own way, it's their sum that makes this such an incredible album in my mind. where felt mountain remained rather mellow and etheral thruought the entire album, black cherry offers more in the way of diverse melodies and tempo.  the tracks seem to be placed specifically in a way that makes the album feel like a journey, and, personally, like a lay's potato chip, not able to listen to just one....yeah, i need the whole thing..
MY HUSBAND AND I PLAY THIS CD ALL THE TIME.  WE BOTH LOVE IT
Listen, did I hear someone say "lack of energy?"Get this album, as my lovely wife did for me last Christmas, from Amazon, BTW, and listen to this lineup: Fire  Water, Mr. Big, I'm A Mover, Woman,  All Right Now, Oh I Wept, Stealer, Walk in My Shadow... Oh, get up off the floor, amigo... see, it's you that's having a lack of energy... I know, this music is like a workout, emotionally, aurally, and in the old pleasure zone too. Rodgers  the late great Paul Kossoff surely knew how to sell a song, didn't they? Perhaps these fellows were near the best, not only at the time, but in any century of Rock/blues/git-down-kick in-the-mud blooz music. Yowzah
I have been a fan for Jaci Velasquez for the past eight years and enjoy hearing her voice in both languages.  I do not speak Spanish but enjoy her artistic abilities none the less.  This album lived up to the Velasquez name in my book- My family and I only really enjoy the traditional sounding Christmas carols and tend to not enjoy the revised versions.  Jaci's album not only made sure the carols were sung traditionally but she has given us a gift a couple new songs that will be added to my Christmas traditions!  Overall I LOVE this album and the only reason I did not give it a full five stars was that I am done with that Chipmunk Song.  Sorry everybody.
I think his debut had the best lyrics. This joint gets off to a good start with We Still Party and pretty much bangs till the end. His production on here is best described as "Late 90's Roger Troutman-esque G-Funk". Geust Stars like 2nd II NOne, AMG, Suga Free and El Debarge get their shine on.Top Joints:We Still Party 	(Peter Gunz and Quik on the track) Quik jacks the VERB song from School House Rock. (The Jam)So Many Wayz 	Hand In Hand You'z A Ganxta 	(Quik refutes rumors that he was involved in Biggie's demise. Also denounces reference to death in rap songs.)I Useta Know Her (Should be called I Useta Hit That)Speed 	Medley for a 'V' (The P***y Medley) 	Get 2Getha Again (Class of 91, 2nd II None, AMG and Quik triple team on this track.) 	Reprise (Medley For A 'V)
I bought this for my kids because I knew they would love these songs just as I did.  Forget them!  I love it!  There is NOTHING like the Chipmunks and never will be again.  The Christmas song is worth the price alone.  Don't think about it.  Just get it
For those who have watched the movie Jaws (ask yourself, who hasn't) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score John Williams did for it. This cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly, with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film.The linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information, which gives the overall package a nice touch. The overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent. A highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music
I have just purchased this CD (the day it came out!) and from what I've heard, it is amazing, surpassing (but not replacing) Boulez's earlier recording. If you are a fan of Boulez, 20th century music, or music in general, this is a must get
Their 4th album as a complete group (not counting the few album Havoc  Prode'je put out) is my least favorite of the 4 SCC albums I have (I don't have the one from 1992 or 2005), but it still gets itself a 4 star rating.  Out of the 13 songs on here none are vclassics or worth skipping; 4 are ok and the other 9 are good.  Like all their albums, guests are minimal and are on are on 2 of the 13 songs.  Production is mostly handled by Prode'je (as with all their albums) he does get a little help from Robert "Fonksta" Bacon  Tomie Mundie.  A good album to have for SCC fans but not their best work.#1 - 8#2 - 8#3 - 7.5#4 - 7.5#5 - 7#6 - 8#7 - 8.5 (f/ C-Bo, Spice 1, Prophet ---- also on their "Gangsta Conversation" album)#8 - 9 (f/ Daz Dillinger --- good beat)#9 - 8#10 - 9 (good beat, deeper song -- my favorite on here)#11 - 8#12 - 8 (another deeper song)#13 - 7.5SCC is --- Havikk, Prode'je, Havoc, L.V., DJ Gripp, DJ KaosCheck all my review
This CD provides a fantastic overview of Rypdal, who has been recording for ECM for 30+ years now.  The tracks range from pieces with an electric Miles sound to an orchestrated track.  While very diverse, the tracks work well together and are unified by his unique,atmospheric tone and excellent compositions.  The infamous ECM sound quality is even better due to 24 bit mastering.  Informative liner notes as well.  Highly recommended
What has happened to the song "Lives in the balance" on this set?  If you go to his website it sounds really great!!!  On this set it sounds awfull!!  It sounds as if he was in a really big hurry to get the song over with.  The packaging if you could call it that is really lame.  Foam dots for holders?  What do you do when those fall off?  I suppose you put the cd's in jewel cases or else they will get really scratched up.  Not to mention it is missing some of his greatest work!  True you do get alot of songs for the money but, there should have been more time planning this set out before actually producing it.  If you own an I-pod I suggest you go to apples I-tunes web page and import the great songs this set is missing as well as the others you really like off of this set and you will probably have spent the same amount of money if not less
The Coltrane soundscapes that this CD is infused flies to the mountain and back again, that's the truth, but one troubling question for me remains; no matter how much I enjoy this fusion incarnation by masters (new  old) - Where in the world is Alan Holdsworth? If any fusion guitar player has the rightful title claim to the Coltrane moniker - it's Holdsworth. For years he's been building the bridge between the good old philosophies and the new world order.   Including Holdsworth would have just been the jazziest thing to do.  
It was my full belief that the next time we would hear from Buju Banton on an album would be on the now 2 years anticipated `Rasta Got Soul' album. The album which has still yet to arrive (and may never) was said to be along Buju's best and might actually rival his seminal classic `Til Shiloh. He even tipped his hand 2 years ago by releasing the album's first single, the `magical' Magic City. So the world was waiting to see just how much Soul the album had.However. Between then and now Buju has been going through so many events that this album, Too Bad, almost seems like a smack in the face to his critics. Forever, it seems that he is still living in the `Boom Bye Bye Curse', and having some legal matters which prevented him traveling, he apparently has been angered by all the unwanted attention and the result is Too Bad. The album has a severe kick to it, it can actually sit not too far away from his `stablemate' Assassin's Infiltrate from `05, in terms of style.The attraction here is actually the subject of  `confusion'. While we were waiting for a massive roots album to come down the pipe, Buju hasn't made a pure dancehall album in a very very long time. Thus, the DJ who was once the dancehall's main attraction stepping back into the fray isn't at all a bad thing. So fans who sit longing for the days of Stamina Daddy and Batty Rider are the one's who'll be happy and I can fit into that camp as well! But at the same time, Buju's concentration for the last decade or so has been the roots, so now it is there where he will ultimately excel. However, with the current trend in dancehall to revive older riddims, you may find yourself feeling like 1991 all over again.The best tune here is probably  the hard hard `Til It Bend. Til it Bend is serious serious rudey dancehall. The song might sound like the rest to the untrained ear, but I guarantee that is the song most Jamaican will pull up, Til it Bend is nice! Also check the wicked wicked Nothing, Who Have It?, the ultra clever Better Day and the nice Hey Boy over the Petty Thief riddim.However, my second favorite song here I would have to say would be the combination Don  Dupes with underrated dancehall singer Pinchers who has been making a very very nice return to the scene recently, largely due to his connection with Madhouse head, Dave Kelly. Buju makes an attempt (for some reason) at the useless Wipeout riddim on Me  Unu and actually makes it work a little. Also check when things slow down on nice tunes such as Driver, which is easily one of the best tunes on the album.Overall, the thought alone, Buju doing another dancehall album may have some salivating and some wondering where the roots is, this one may appeal to both group of hardcore fans. While there is nothing here that I would call definitive roots reggae, this album has such an old school vibes to it that anyone who has ever been a fan of Buju's will find something they like. I would have like to have seen Buju have at least one Lenky riddim on the album, a Wayne Wonder combination (although Pinchers subs just fine) and definitely the massive song Beauty Queen from the Twice Again riddim would have fit just fine here, but nevertheless, what you do have: High quality dancehall from one of the greatest architects of that skill is just fine and Too Bad, over both what Beenie and Baby Cham have done, is the best pure dancehall album of 2006 to date, and a boomshot in the arm for the genre
I ordered mine from here (Amazon Marketplace) a couple weeks ago, and I'm a very happy camper. This is one of the best online purchases I've made in a long, long time! First of all, there are songs I've never heard before, so by owning this compilation, it helps me get to know the band's material, or Siobhan's own solo stuff much better. All the songs are very well-written and catchy. Thanks to my best friend, he drew me toward's SS's music back in the 90's with the "HORMONALLY YOURS" CD. SS's music was always something I pushed to the "back burner" because I didn't know what to make of it. But in the past 2 years, I've focused on the new material from the "Shakespears Sister #3" album...and it blew me away! Siobhan is a true musical genius!"I DON'T CARE" seems to be a differnt version. It's much brighter  fresher-sounding than the album version. Wow!"HELLO (TURN YOUR RADIO ON) is my favorite "SS" song of all time  also appears to be a different version. Just hearing the first notes from it, my eyes got all teary. It's just the way I am, regarding this song. The Clock ticking at the end reminds me of a heartbeat or something. Dark songs like this draw me near. LOL The compilation is missing one song "BITTER PILL". I wanted  hoped for this song to be released on the CD, but unfortunately it didn't make it. Awwww!The liner notes booklet is packed with all lyrics, cool photos and a fine page of background regarding the recordings of their albums. Siobhan is one cool gal! I love the front  back artwork, for it is both amusing, colorful  dramatic. I'm a sucker for dramatic stuff like this. Hopefully, Siobhan will continue recording lots of new material, using the "Shakespears Sister" title. I despise the crap we hear on the radio nowadays. Hopefully now that SF has released this package, the music will get more airplay. I like the nostalgic aspect of music from a decade ago, because it reminds us of how the music industry used to be non-commercial and fun. Yes...it's too bad that Siobhan and Marcella broke up, because their 2 uniquely different voices complimented one another. There hasn't been a duo like them since!My Thoughts on the DVD...I love it! The first  only video clip I've ever seen from "SS" is "STAY". Totaly blew me away since the first time I saw it. I've always loved seeing Siobhan as "Death", in her starry crown  black "Glitzy" outfit. She makes the perfect female version of "Death". I could never understand the video until now, because I never had the chance to see the entire thing on TV. The other videos are equally great and draw me closer each time.I appreciate the "Chaptered" Menu for the videos. At least I know what's from where. The DVD was put together very well, and is packed with great stuff.Fortunately, my DVD player on the Computer and the TV can play this All-Region PAL DVD. I haven't experienced any difficulties (skipping tracks or anything). It all plays fine. Actually, when i purchased this Item online, the item description said "NTSC Format (USA  CANADA)...so that's why I bought it.

The previous review has a few inaccuracies I thought I'd correct. First off, the beats on all of Atmosphere's albums, including this one, are produced and created by Ant, not DJ Abilities. Ant does not perform live, and so Slug often used to perform with DJ Abilities (and others). This may change in the next album as Atmosphere now includes a band soon to tour, but it's extermely likely Ant will be included in the production.Slug has never been 1/3 of Atmosphere, he has and always will be the main driving force and only consistent member of the group. Even when Spawn was a member of Atmosphere, Slug was still clearly the leader and brains beyond the operation, as evidenced by the tracks on Overcast!, all of which were dominated by Slug.Yes, this album is quite different from the newer stuff, and represents a critical moment in Atmosphere's evolution. Of course, anyone can listen to it. Even those silly "fan boys." It's a ridiculous notion to suggest that because something has changed, people won't like earlier incantations of the same group. It's that elitist old school b.s. and it's annoying. Some may not like it, but most hip-hop fans will probably enjoy it.  What makes this album so interesting is how raw it is, and, as Slug says in the liner notes, how it's representative of his transformation as an MC. Recorded between Overcast! and Lucy Ford, you can witness Slug move from being a whitty, well-versed thug to something deeper and more innovative. Both elements are present. "The Abusing of the Rib" is one of the more evolved tracks on the album, while "@ It Again" is about sleeping with all sorts of girls in the Twin Cities, including yours of course. Note that I say "evolved" not in the sense that one song is better than another, but rather more representative of Slug's later work (Lucy Ford). This album represents a critical moment in the history of what I believe is the best hip hop group (individual) out there. While it doesn't have the catchiest melodies (the beats are great, just not catchy), it has some amazing rhymes and showcases Slug's ability to flow quickly and rap prolifically. Check it out
This CD is a must for anyone who enjoys great guitar music. Its packed full of amazing pieces and inspiring playing. My favorite track is Isn't it Romantic because it successfully makes a classic out of this song. BUY IT NOW!!
Although this sports new remastering, unless you have either the Golden Hits CD available here at Amazon and your local CD shop, the now out of print Golden Celebration boxed set or the 2 volume "Patti Page Collection" series (Volume 2 is also out of print), this is unnecessary as it duplicates every track on Golden Hits except for Let Me Go Lover instead of With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming and the songs are arranged in a different order.  Fans are better off looking for the 2 previous out of print collections with Let Me Go Lover to obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff, either buy Golden Hits, the boxed set and the 2 volume Patti Page Collection series, and BTW, Vol. 1 is still in print so you can order it right here at Amazon
As a pretty big comedy fan thanks to XM radio, i have listened to a lot of comics and I own a lot of comic CD's (Mitch Hedberg, Bill Hicks, Emo Philips, Lewis Black, Steven Wright, Pablo Francisco etc.) and my absolute favorite is Unprotected.  There is not a slow part on this CD and it never fails to bring everyone to tears on a long car ride.  His quick and merciless wit is better than any other comic in the US.  His family must be very understanding since he doesn't hesitate to include every detail of their personal lives in his act, but it all serves to create a punchline that we can all relate to.  The highlights of this CD are his daughter's boyfriend and guidelines for resuming sex after a heart attack.  I highly highly reccomend this
If you want some Classical music to sleep to, don't buy this CD.  If you want some high energy symphonies, however, I highly recommend it.  From Bach to Vivaldi, the pure energy of this CD will give you a new understanding of the joys of Classical music.  Just don't listen to Track 25, because I have no idea why John Philip Sousa is included with Tchaichovsky
This is one of the most beautiful, restorative collections of Celtic music I have ever heard.  Haunting, sublime harp, cello, guitar, flute, and soundscapes create an atomosphere of serenity for meditation, prayer, or simply unwinding the mind and emotions.  The poetry which originated each selection is included and provides a meditation in itself.  Highly recommended
Juice Newton is one of the best counry-pop singers of all times. A great energetic voice and some real unforgettable songs.My personal favourites include the beautiful Angel Of The Morning, the rollicking Queen of Hearts and the strong and sorrowful  It's A Heartache After all these years, her work is unforgettable, catchy and full of energy and vibe
I like this album.  Its got a nice mix of old and new material.  Along with some live material.  Great to see PE still at it in this ever changing rap game
This is a great album. Two of their biggest hits, "Another One Bites The Dust," and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love," are here. My favorites are "Need Your Loving Tonight, " and "Prime Jive." Most of the other songs are top notch, too. None of the later Queen albums matched this one. Definitely in the class of Night At The Opera, Day At The Races and News Of The World
The band is excellent and this album is just shy of the high quality of the first.  However, the encroachment of our free use rights as legal consumers by the major record companies will not stop until they see a negative financial impact from pushing these copy crippled products. Don't support these products
David Foster, who wrote a few tunes on Yes's "Time and a Word" is here on bass with Tony Kaye on the B3 and it's the performance of their lives captured live at the Rainbow. A brave but good way to record a debut album, album was produced by Jon Anderson and the cover drawn by Roger Dean, just like Yes. It gives you feeling that Tony left Yes on good terms when Rick Wakeman stepped in
I was looking for some nice background nature sounds to have playing while I work throughout the day. This collection hits the spot. Great sounds, great variety, great price
I have listened to this CD for the last several years before going to sleep at night.  I love classical music, and this is great music to help make my soul feel at peace and unwind after a taxing day. 
Forget the nit-picky comments you may read here, if you are a fan of any of the artists on this album, buy it!  The recording is of very high quality, and I agree with another review, vacuum tube amplification makes the vocals even better.  The banter between the artists in between the  musical numbers is a real treat for fans too young to experience these  shows live.  One other observation, if you buy this not having a HUGE  appreciation for Sammy already, you will be blown away by his talent.  ..thanks to  Sinatra family for releasing this disc.  Hopefully many more are  forthcoming
If you really into French Baroque That is......
I was very young to really appreciate the in-s and outs of this band and the members between SAMMY, Roth and EVH!  I honestly can consider myself a newbie to this time-tested rockers.  I just downloaded this off of iTunes and i can tell u folks, every track is amazing! its like when Lars (Metallica) said once: "i was always amazed with G"...if i may borrow this line, i had always heard of the great EVH vs. Hagar vs Roth but honestly never appreciated this Guitar work before today! EVH is an amazing talent and it will continue to influence i am sure allot of new artists. My brother in Law was debating with us about Slash, Sammy, EVH, and Edge (U2), Clapton  and apparently they all chose EVH.  I didn't believe it till i heard it!  EVH is an inspiration. Anyone interested even remotely in any of these guys in EVH's history, should get this album because it is truly harnesses from almost all the worlds EVH has been to and in!
This is part 2 of a set titled SAY IT RIGHT. The CD has a blue and white style vs. the part 1 that has a yellow and white style on disc and cover. Also in a slim-line jewel case with the title track, non-album track, but an added dance remix plus video. If you enjoyed the first 2-track CD then this is a must. Dance lovers will definitely find this to be a totally spectacular production.SAY IT RIGHT [Radio Edit] has the catchy dance beats, nice vocals, excellent drums, and chorus. The lyrics are fun to sing along and strong in meaning. Apparently, it's about not giving a lover power to control, destroy, or make you loose sleep. The melody has great rhythm, chorus, dance styles, and energetic beats. "You don't mean nothing at all to me" is repeated showing a strong message that life doesn't end with someone who isn't right. WHAT I WANTED brings Nelly to a slower tempo displaying depth of emotion. It's a slow ballad with true sincerity and humility. It's about going for something you wanted but never got. The outcome doesn't matter because the reality is you gave it your all. As she sings about her dream and what she wanted it's apparent love can be hard to let go yet comforting to do so. The melody is soothing, pleasant in sound, and refreshing for the soul. SAY IT RIGHT [Peter Rauhofer Remix Part 1] is a hot club remix sure to get you dancing off your feet. The song takes a dive to faster paced trance like effects, different introduction, pumping jamming dance styles with techno flairs, up and down tempos as well as plenty of percussion and synthesizers. Straying from the original song the vocals are still vastly heard yet filled with echoes, swirls of sounds, and much club ambiance. It's dreamy, fantasy filled, and definitely highly paced for the dance floor. If anything is certain it is this: The Remix in this CD is much better than many of her past singles. There is true DJ styles incorporation more instrumentations, effects, and vast production much more geared to club hoppers and dance fans. Quite sticky, infectious, and groove like this remix will get you dancing up a storm feeling like wanting to shake your body non-stop. Club lovers don't pass this out. Nelly's vocals are echoed often and electronic-a effects are vastly hard. SAY IT RIGHT VIDEO [Enhanced CD] is the video many have already seen as Timbaland and Nelly dance face to face and get very close as the message behind the music is reinforced. This is an excellent video with much dance styles, highly energetic beats, and flairs for control and getting the message across.Overall, from all of Nelly's singles I find this to be on the top of my favorite. The combination of 2 highly emotional yet different songs plus a dance track and video makes this remarkable. Definitely buy this if you are a Nelly fan, club hopper, or a lover of music to enjoy for the depth of emotion, different styles displayed, and the themes. It's definitely a top sensation. Before it sells out be sure to buy it. The part 1 is also an excellent addition for those days you don't want to listen to the remix. This is highly recommended for sure!
If you like post modern lounge music, you will like the tracks on this disc. 
Almost a classic in my book.  We bumped this on the southside of Chicago when this dropped. These two were like a west coast EPMD because they blended perfectly. U could tell them apart easily because Gangsta D had the eazy-e voice with the hard lyrics. While KK had a gruff voice and was a str8 clown. KK would say anything. Once again the whole crew is on this one also: Quik, Hi-C, and AMG. They had a tight click that just seemed to from Voltron how they worked together. My favorites on this album are: If u Want it, Be True 2 yourself, Let the Rhythm,and Just Ain't Me (KK solo). I still take hoodrats on "Triple MMM Shots".....Listen to the album to find the meaning. Hotep!!
These tunes may not immediately remind you of Steve Miller but his talent is not belied.  It's some really peaceful music.  Great to turn on just at bedtime and drift off to la la land
This record is a fine example of earnest juju music.  Other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards.  Chief Commander Obe has always managed to offer more traditional representation of juju as it evolved from highlife.  Keep in mind, this means amazing percussion work, intertwining guitar lines, loving vocals and long well developed instrumentals.  If you're interested, you should buy it.  It will make you happy, no matter how you were feeling, and what you're doing
Sensational is a word I'd use to describe Singer Jesse McCartney. Good looks and powerful vocals. He's talented and sweet. If you haven't gotten a copy of his latest CD 'Right Where You Want Me', buy it today
This EP is so good, that words cannot do it justice. They thought so too and exercised restraint (no lyrics) on this album. It is a departure from the previous album From the Vapor of Gasoline (which is also a very good album) in other ways, too, however; it features a more delicate production and more intricate interplay between the instruments. The production is such that it highlights the timbre of each instrument and, thus, their interdependency, whereas the previous album seemed content to let everything settle into a murky consistency at various points (usually when things started to rock). FTVOG also had the problem of being a bit monotonous (of course: in the end, you grew to enjoy it for all its shortcomings). All the Suits Began to Fall OFf seems to be flawless, however - a well-rounded tour; very beautiful, bold and particular. Try if you like: John Fahey, Tortoise, June of 44, Sea Tiger, etc
Some musicians, like fine chefs, make it look so easy.  David Grisman is one of them.  On the CD, I'm Beginning to See the Light, the prolific mandolinist extraordinaire is joined by Scottish guitar virtuoso  Martin Taylor and veteran Grisman Quintet members Jim Kerwin and George  Marsh (on bass and drums/percussion, respectively) for one hot little  album.  While the song list is comprised of many well-loved standards, such  as Autumn Leaves, Makin' Whoopee, Lover  Man, and Cheek to Cheek, the Taylor/Grisman Quartet seems  to have so much fun preparing its stew and adds enough incredible  seasonings to the pot to make Emeril shout, Bam!  As Don  Stierberg, who penned the liner notes, says:  Music need not be  trendy to be great.  I wholeheartedly agree.  (C.A. Carlino
This is an amazing CD - I cannot believe that more people have not discovered Charlie Sexton.  The songs are personal and beautifully written.   The music rocks, and yet it's different than any of Sexton's other music.   He is a brilliant artist and this is a brilliant wor
Good CD, but where is his recent hit I Wanna Feel That Way Again and his classic hit Walkin' To Jeruselum
i have been into vaisnava spirituality a long time, and they really got it, perfect and professional 
Imagine yourself sitting in a bistro on the Champs Elysees, sipping a nice glass of bordeux as your glance pulls you toward an alluring .... You get the picture. Now buy the CD and thank me later! Highly recommended from  someone who thought they heard it all! Bravo Senor Douglas
Modern dub stylings from an assortment of recording artists, ranging from the bizarre and brilliant (check The Lost Scrolls of Hamarik's darkly deranged How To Find Royal Jelly), to the utterly unforgiveable (namely, Luciano's appaling attempt at Police  Thieves). Luckily for us, most of the tunes here fall into or around the former category, with great contributions from St. Germain (bouncing dub-disco on A Dub Experience), Grant Phabao (updated roots righteousness on Andub Head Yudu) and Boozoo Bajou (with the wonderfully cheesey Divers). And let's not overlook Cottonbelly's 90's classic Tempest Dub, which resurrects an old Scientist tune to spine-tingling effect. Only the fairly plain Seven Dub and the aforementioned Luciano really fail to ignite...All in all then, a worthwhile collection which works very nicely as a whole - providing you program the CD player to skip the occassional duffer
this ancient jazz classic never sounded better.Rudy Van Gelder did an excellent job remastering this one with the 24- bit.He proves that it does matter who takes up the task of remastering this wonderful jazz classic. just keep them coming Rudy
Once she has won your heart, you will want this collection to hear how she developed as a performer -- and came to be a great symbol of France in the 20th Centur
Incredible follow up to Rated R which I didn't think could be equaled and they did.  Flat out incredible songwriting, amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best.  If you grew up in the 70's as I did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you. "Go With The Flow" is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you won't be skipping any songs on this disc. Baby Boomers rejoice, rock is back
I bought this the year it came out, after seeing George in concert and it is great! Most of these were big hit songs and I found that I really loved the others too especially Hard Day
This album has morse code on it, what more can you say......well some of that morse code actually sounds like that UA6 you just worked on 40 metres, complete with T6 buzz and slow drift.And the music is pretty good too.
My one complaint is that after I listen to this CD, the catchy tunes get stuck in my head!  And then I want to keep listening to it more and more.  I love the selections on this CD, the fact that the songs are in English (I always wondered what the "Figaro, Figaro, Figaro" song was about!), and that a little background is given to each piece as well
ANother hot release, top 5 in 2005 so far. No one even metions track 7 produced by one and only El-Producto and track 8 by belief. Hot cd recommend to those who don't listin to bull
I recently acquired this cd from my local indepedent record store.  This is a wonderful cd.  There is not much I can say.  I am a pianist myself, and it is enlightening to see how this brilliant composer/player plays the piano.  His style is completely unique.  Thelonius Monk is one of my favourite jazz artists.  I recommend this to anybody who has any interest in jazz
Ethereal, rhythmic, haunting, eclectic.  Wake: Best of Dead Can Dance is a collection of songs that will move your soul and spirit. The haunting combination of modern and ancient tunes, combined with phenomenal  vocals and instrumentals make this album one to cherish and listen to over and over.  Each time you hear it will lead to new discoveries and emotions. 
This is their best album.Easily better than anything the likes of Oasis ever managed.Richard III,Going Out,Late In The Day and the title track are all top quality.If you rated Blurs 3 Britpop(horrible term really) albums from the 90s then get this.Its up there with them.Simple as that
This is a must have for anyone with an R "oldies" collection. You won't be disappointed
I Dug The Soundtrack better than the film.The Music Sounds Good Through out.if the film had have just focused on The Music it would have been Incredible.The Musicianship is Solid Here
I have been following gospel since the early 80s.  I am a big fan of contemporary gospel and Shei Atkins defines how R gospel should sound.  Trinitee 5:7 along with Dawkins  Dawkins have done a great job so far, but Shei Atkins covers it all--Relationships (cheating, divorce, pre-marital sex); worship; hymns; enocuragement; you name it and she has a song for it.  I just bought the CD and I can't take it out of my CD player!!  Her voice is so annointed and unique! She can easily give Beyonce, Erykah Badu and Mary Blige a run for their money! She can easily be played on mainstream radio and everyone would be bobbin' their heads to it--yet she has no problem mentioning Jesus in any of her songs!For those Christians who are looking for something that they can groove and relax too (with some anointing) PLEASE buy this CD--I promise you that you won't be disappointed!  I can literally listen to every song on this CD over and over again
Great CD for young and old alike.  The music puts a smile on your face each time you listen to it.  I have it on in my car and it keeps me in a good mood at all times
Its  just realy sad that hip-hop dont sound like  hard to earn anymore... Gang starr still gets daily airplay on my stereo and im glad i support these guys
Alvin Lee is a genius with a guitar.  Nowhere is this more evident than in his mastery of the Blues.  He was and is a great rocker, but his true calling is as a bluesman.  This is a great album
This is from the days when you had to be good to grab a mic. Lyrical wizardry was the order of the day, if you had no skillz you stayed away from the mic. The production is as tight as the lyrics on this album both were made for each other. BUY THIS!!!!!!!
Both the Italian version (Io Canto) and the Spanish version (Yo Canto) are excellent, and amongst the best albums that I have heard this past year. The music is absolutely beautiful, fresh, and very well paced, and Laura's voice is soaring! The quality of this album is exceptional....the production of the songs lends to Laura's very passionate approach to them. Without understanding a word of either version, I cannot get enough of them! Listening to Laura on this latest release of hers over and over again, each song continues to grow on me and I find myself completely absorbed in this album! Do yourself a favor and get this one....especially if you live in the United States. It will give you an opportunity to experience the power of what music can be if done right. You'll find yourself relating to words you don't even understand!
In this CD Laura Pausini performs songs from a variety of Italian singer-songwriters.  She ads her personal touch to all of them, of course.  The results are lovely and inspired.  A lot of the songs already had versions in castellano, but Laura and her team have written new Spanish lyrics to some of them.  All of these songs were made famous by their creators.  Most of the songs are ballads, but there are some midtempo tracks in the title track, "Dos" (Due, by Raf) and "Estrella gemela" (by Eros Ramazzotti), and danceable pop in "Mi banda toca rock."  I don't know about the comment from the reviewers below about "Mi banda toca rock" as Menudo song (a horrible thought to some of us!), but the original Italian version was fun.  It's not a bubblegum song, but about the combination of traditional Latin music (Latin in the original sense, all the musical varieties of romance-language speakers) and rock music, something that was starting to happen when the song was written.  This reminds me that someone was commenting that one of the songs had some sections in English.  I believe they are wrong about the song.  "Estrella gemela" has some sections in English, but that is the way it was originally written and performed by Eros Ramazzotti (in Italian and Spanish), to emphasize the influence of African-American gospel music in the song.  Laura also references this influence by using gospel chords at the start of the song.  All in all, this is a great album, so give it a shot.  Whether you speak the language or not, the Italian version of the album is even better.  Laura just keeps getting better with time!  Laura sei bravissima
Nothing deep, by any means, but simply a light, airy listen, with a compilation of quirky tropical tunes. Even though the songs (most of them) weren't in the movie, they remind me of it, of the whole Hawaiian atmosphere. My favorite tracks, excluding the ones included on the previous CD, are Blue Hawai'i (by Elvis), My Little Grass Shack, Coconut (it's just bizarre, but addicting, making you smile with absurdity), Island in the Sun, Pineapple Princess, and Love Me Tender. Again, it's nothing dramatic or swirling, but it you adored Lilo  Stitch (And how can you not?) and all it stood for, this CD might just bring some warmth into a cold day. Don't think about it. Listen and pretend you're there
I borrowed this CD from a public library, having liked the track "Crazy Life" on the Empire Records Soundtrack, and I was immediately blown away by how consistently good Coil is the whole way through. It is their most mature album, full of gentle emotion and idealism, and puts the listener in a good mood. Glen Phillip's voice is unique, confident, and beautiful. I fell in love immediately with "Rings" and "Dam Would Break". The haunting and beautiful harmonies captivate. "Little Buddha" is so different but so good as well. After I got Coil, I bought two of Toad's older albums: Fear and Dulcinea. Both are really good, but something keeps drawing me back to Coil. It is achingly beautiful, vibrant, thoughtful, and pleasurable. It is hearing Toad at their best.
The original Jack johnson LP was my favourite Miles record. I also had an expensive Japanese CD but all this would not prepare me for what I discover here. Over these CDs one discovers the original sessions from which the record was made. This is simply wonderful. Ok sometimes it takes quite a bit of patience to sit trhough all this but it is worth the time
I love it so.  I bought it after seeing the video for "Make You Feel That Way" and I haven't been disappointed.  Love the vibe of the CD...it just flows and the mix is well done, as you go from a "head-nodder" to a smooth groove so seamlessly.  I just put it in and let it play!  My absolute favorite jam is "Nowhere Fast," which comments on what we were, what we are and what we hope to be "tomorrow."  I love this CD so much, I went and bought their other two full play CD's.  I make my girls sick with how much I play this CD.  I guess I'll eventually take it out the rotation, maybe "tomorrow!"  A must for anyone who loves great HIP HOP
Anais is one of the best cingers.I have seen her since objetivo fama, and she is just great.Don't listen to people who say this cd is bad because the are just hating.This cd is just great
This was the first Queen album that I ever had so getting it on CD is great.  "Sheer Heart Attack" is an overlooked Queen gem
I first heard Joe playing in that urgent style of his, on Horace Silvers' song for my father album. The thing about him is that his playing has always sounded mature and developed, like he was born to play.  On this CD, Felicidade in particuliar, he simmers, builds to a rolling  boil, and simmers again so nicely as he takes you to Brasil. Also the  straight ahead playing on Triste' is nothing short of marvelous playing by  the group!  The whole is CD is great. Go 'head Joe
This album is the shyit, cougnut and c-fresh deliver, the only problem you might have with this album is figuring out which one is cougnut and which one is c-fresh, but as you listen you will tell differences. Back in the days is real old album, so audio can be bad for a couple of the tracks but there isnt a weak track on this album. The beats don't get too bass heavy untill Hillary after that song the next 4 tracks or so are very bass heavy, but the flows are tops. These guys are the definition of gangsta, and is a must for anybody who likes gangsta rap. All guests are sick to, Dre Dog,Cellski,Chewy,R.b.l,2.2 and Mack and Al Kapone. Definetly a classic
I got the pleasure of seeing Albert open for bb king. Unfortunately for BB king, because once Albert started playing his Flying V, with blues power, he demoralized anybody that came after him. He had the entire Universal amphitheater standing. and stayed standing for most of his show. blues power is one of his best. Get, listen, and then really listen. Because you can feel your skin crawl with extacy from those notes..
The Bloodshot Gang knows how to have a good time!  If you're into the whole Alt.Country thing, you know that some of it is very sincere and serious (ie, Uncle Tupelo, Jayhawks).  Now I love "No  Depression," and "Blue Earth," but this is an altogether  different quadrant of alternative country known as Militant Honky Tonk, or  just Insurgent Country.  Truth be told, this incredible anniversary  compilation does have some poignant, serious numbers (Rico Bell's  "Money to Burn," the Texas Rubies' "Blue Diamond Mine,"  Mike Ireland's "I'd Like To"), but for the most part these  maniacs are not taking themselves or the world that seriously.  You've got  Andre Williams and Sally Timms singing "I'll stick to you like  glue...", in mock romantic seriousness with background singers going  "G-L-E-U, GLUE!"  You've got a song with a man and a woman  serenading each other saying with deep country feeling how much they miss  each other's bodies.  You've got Kim Docter and Moonshine Willy belting out  "Turn the Lights Down Low," which really ought to be a hit it's  so catchy.  And you've got some great deadpan covers -- the Waco Brothers  do a country rave-up of the Who's Baba O'Riley," Red Star Belgrade  does it to AC/DC's "Highway to Hell," and best of all, the Unholy  Trio turns Public Enemy's "Bring the Noise" into an understated  redneck anthem.  I'm only scratching the surface here, with 40 tracks over  2 discs.  This is a great introduction to the rowdier side of that  sprawling beast that has not a name that can be agreed on...   And don't miss the fantastic earlier Bloodshot compilation, HELL-BENT (Insurgent Country, Volume II) -- see my 9/5/04 review
Any one of the first 4 cuts on this album are worth the price of admission.  These pieces, each melodically rich and honed like a fine gem, remind me more of classical romanticism than what normally passes for New Age.  Sit back in a cosy armchair with a glass of wine and let this beautifully-crafted music weave its web...it's feel good music that also has an intellectually satisfying bittersweet flavor
I consider this the first album in the second half of the career of Oasis. Following the departure of Bonehead and Guigsy, this album is basically all the Gallagher brothers. Having learnt lessons from Be Here Now, Oasis have gone back to a more basic style of production as opposed to the over the top production from Be Here Now. While the songs are not as good on here, they sound better and the whole album sounds as if it wasn't as rushed. This signifies a big change of direction for the band, with little less ego's and a more sober approach to their music, it is only the songwriting that lets this album down. My least favourite of all Oasis albums, it features two really good songs, 6 mediocre and 2 dreadful ones. It is missing another two songs to make it complete, I think it should have included the B'sides 'lets all make believe' and 'carry us all'. It still includes a few Beatle-esque songs 'who feels love' and 'roll it over' and Noel once again takes over lead vocal duties, this time on two tracks, 'where did it all go wrong' and 'sunday morning call'.This is a very important album, it grounded the band again after their ego's had taken off. This helped relaunch the career and because of it they sound at their best today
Herb Alpert has done what few artists can do. He's taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original.I love the original "Whipped Cream", but this CD is a masterstroke. Combining Alpert's traditionally peppy music with downbeat electronica transforms it into a soothing, but never boring mix that continues to enchant the listener from beginning to end.Unlike some of the purists, I loved this CD and you will too
I found this CD by browsing Amazon and decided to give it a try.  I am happy with all of the tracks.  Some tracks remind me of Beatles a little, but not all, so the band does have a unique sound.  Even though from the 90s, the sound is like many bands making it today.  I like it.
What I love most about Scofield's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style. He is careful not to over do it, while still demonstrating skill and precision. His riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed.  The only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding  songs, I rarely make it to the end of this CD. Still for those who enjoyed  A Go-Go, this one is quite similar, so make sure to pick it up.  This quality funk CD with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking, but  is a great casual listen. (Guitarist can definitely pick up a few ideas  here!
DJ Quik (the best producer ever) did all the tracks in this one with help from Robert Bacon on some tracks. This album is just CLASSIC nuthin more to it!
3rd Force's new CD Force Field is their first new CD in a few years.  The track Revelation of the Heart sets the tone for this wonderful recording.  A must have to add to your collection
A ridiculously good album. This is as good an introduction to Jawbox as you're going to find. It's got most of their really great songs, plus some live songs which are great. Another good thing is that Desoto Records (the label that was started by the band) has re-released the CD, so it shouldn't be as hard to find
I gotta be honest, when I first listened to this album I was dissapointed. But like any truly amazing album, it just took some decoding, listening to the songs multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are doing. Essentially, GaT are four people who are amazing at what they do, and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to mesh together perfectly. Their first album, emphasizer, blew me away, but I felt it lost steam around halfway through. This album does no such thing, and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album, which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for. This gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any wizardry in the production department. But dont get me wrong, this cd SOUNDS amazing. Anyway, I saw them live last night in NYC, and they blew my mind... I recommend this CD to ANYONE, and see them live if you get the RARE opportunity!
Two of the greatest names in show business at their zenith. There are so many good tracks on this set that it's hard to pick out some over the others. A couple of superb standouts are Jolson's "Swanee" and "Rock-A-Bye," although every track is just excellent. The sound quality on the set is outstandingly great. I hope the people that put this set together will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by Jolson and Crosby
This is the best "cover" album I have ever seen or heard in my life.  A wonderful selection of material and a reflection of Agnetha's great judgment of how best to pay tribute to her favorite, and most influential, musical artists. Her voice is absolutely flawless and just as powerful (and pure) as her days of old with ABBA.  It would have sold well with the right kind of promotion such as touring which I read she had planned at one point. Unfortunately, she had to cancel any such ideas.  I would travel anywhere in the world to see her live just once in my life, whether it be to listen to any of the catchy tunes from this album or anything previous.  We can only hope the day will come that she will do a live show again for us adoring and anxious fans.  It's certainly not out of the realm of possibility.  It is neither an impossibility that Agnetha record subsequent material in the not too distant future as this album without a doubt indicates she has so much great music left in her soul to share with the world
A true musical genius. Take a blow get a ZyR voduski and snapple lemonade and let the music cover you up. PowerPLUS from the 70's and 80's. Tight lyrics and pop masterpiece arangements. go todd go
Disappear Fear's music is both calming and uplifting at the same time.  I especially enjoyed "Laws of Nature" because of it lyrics.  (It has a gay-rights lyrics)  Does anyone know which one of the singers is gay?  I would be quite greatful for the answer.  If anyone knows, would you mind posting it under the reviews here? Thanx that would be great!
I don't see how they can compare these guys to The Mars Volta or Coheed and Cambria. I can hear the prog elements but it's more of a Rush kind of prog rock,shorter 3 minute songs compared to 12 minute epics. They are missing the one thing that would make them a true prog rock band: the songs just aren't as epic as a TMV or a CC song. I think reviewers liken Brazil to these other bands because their singer has a high pitched singing voice. This is still an amazing album that is well worth your time. Go into it expecting Sparta rather than The Mars Volta and you won't be disappointed
When this album first came out, I felt jilted. But I recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for what it is and I think its a great album. Make no mistake, if you're a die-hard 80's rocker, you'll hate this album. The production is raw, and the songwriting is lean and mean as opposed to elaberate and detailed. But that doesn't mean that the musicianship is lacking on this record. If you can keep an open mind, I think this ablum is one that you'll love
Dream is a great album where Keller coloboarates with many of his favorite musicians including Bob Wier, Bella Fleck, Victor Wooten and String Cheese Incident. All the songs are unique and great to sing too while driving or anytime!
whoa... this CD rocks, one of my favorite anti-flag albums for sure. This CD may not be what some of the harder punk fans want from anti-flag but i think it also shows they're growth as a band. They can play more than just really loud hard punk (though they play that awesome too!!). Some of the songs on this album incredibly powerful, and some are really catchy too. War Sucks Lets Party is a great anarchist anthem, and One Trillion Dollars is amazingly moving (i mean, seriously! 1 Trillion $ spent on weapons around the world in 2004!) Every track is good and has its own message! They seem to have no problem coming up w/ new songs... there are so many things to ridicule in our gov. I just wish that more people would listen to this band's message.PEACE and LOV
I bought this for my wife, a huge fan of Patrick O'Brian (she's read the books twice in the past two years alone). Ironically, it now sits in my car's CD shuffler where it undoubtedly gets the most airtime. I love this music! As another reviewer mentioned, with some cofee (Killick, there!), this music and Desolation Island in your hand, you feel transported to a life of long ago. When men sang to rouse the soul, brighten the spirit, damn the enemy and win the heart of their Colleen (sorry...Nancy) - all with spine, mind and muscle fully intact. The harmonies are rich, the voices deep. And yet, the last reviewer's questions have the faint ring of truth. My first hearing rang a bit flat, the music sounding just this side of stale. But, in the end, it just don't signify. Even on that first run, by the end of the CD I was clumsily, but merrily joining in with the crew. I suppose I have come to imbue the songs with a life of my own, belting them out at full volume down the highway. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do
NIGHTRAGE - Descent into Chaos-Thomas Lindberg's latest offering to the music community is the Swedish and Greek mix called Nightrage.  This album actually being my first offering to the band I was unsure what to expect.  Like most I am a big fan of ATG and Lindberg's harsh vocal styles.... Nightrage however came as a pleasant surprise. (As in it wasn't, yet another, ATG Clone) They seem to have more Melody than Thrash but definitely embody aspects of both genres....  The Haunted, where the former ATG Guitar Players are now located, seemed have gone with more Thrash then Melody. (Which is odd since they actually have ATG's Guitar Players?)Anyway, Enough Comparisons!  Nightrage is really decent for a newer band in an over saturated scene... Amazing guitar work and one of the genres best Vocalist makes this CD well worth a couple of listens.  Also I've only given this album 2 spins at the current time and stuff like this usually grows on repeated listens.Favorite Songs:  Being Nothing, Phantasma, Omen, and Descent into Chaos.-4 StarsIF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:"Was this review helpful?" 
Well, this isn't At the Gates.  Nightrage reminds me of many old Arch Enemy guitar tunes that were so melodic.  Of course, that leads into Gus G. substituting Chris on concerts being an excellent choice, as they make very similar melodies.  Some people say this album is heavy, which it is in some parts.  But its melodic death, there are no signs of thrash or anything.  Just great melodies, great headbanging music.  Add this to your collection, I think its better than Sweet Vengeance
Chris Joss delivers some serious blaxploitation inspired grooves that will wisk you back to the times of bell bottoms, afros and platform shoes!  Joss' "You've Been Spiked" is a retrospective piece of marvellously produced tracks that pays true homage to an era that gave us some of the funkiest music ever!  In fact, this music sounds so authentic you would think they came straight out of the 70's...but it's all circa the 21st century.  It's good to know that there are still modern cats (especially on the ESL Record label)who know how to recapture music from days gone by.    
This is a really great follow up to Allison Moorer's debut album ALABAMA SONG. THE HARDEST PART, her sophomore CD, was released two years after her debut in September 2000. It builds on the sound presented on her first, and the songs are nothing short of great. My favorite track, though not her own, is her emotional reading of the Rolling Stones' Bring Me All Your Lovin. She makes this song into her own. No Next Time is another favorite, the lyrics are excellent, a great breakup song. The title track is a nice midtempo country number. Send Down An Angel is very sad but touching at the same time. Other highlights include It's Time That I Tried, Day You Said Goodbye, Is It Worth It and Feeling That Feeling Again. Overall, to me this is her best album. You can't go wrong with any of them but this is an artistic acheivement, and one of her best albums yet
I have been a fan since Valotte. and I like the other reviewers here, can't believe why this cd didn't receive the airplay it deserves!There must have been some politics in there, with Sean's cd coming out on the same day ( Yoko?) It is one of those cds that you just leave on and you don't feel like you have to go and skip over songs that you don't like! I love every song!! Especially "Day after Day"," I should have known", "I don't want to know" and my fav right now "Cold".. I hope that what I have heard is true that he is working on his latest now. Can't wait! Buy this cd.. you won't regret it
Every singer ends up attempting Sinatra eventually, but few manage so well.... John Pizzarelli has been playing jazz guitar with his legendary father, Bucky, since he was 6 years old. John's latest album is Dear Mr. Sinatra, on which he plays songs written for Ol' Blue Eyes.... The crooner is noted for his sensitive phrasing and powerful interpretative voice, which recall the relaxed stylings of Nat "King" Cole and Chet Baker, as well as for his fluid, inventive guitar playing. On this album of covers of songs made famous by Frank Sinatra, John Pizzarelli wisely avoids the pitfalls of Ol' Blue Eyes imitations in favor of his own intimate approach, best heard on the set's more relaxed arrangements. My highlights are the tracks "I've Got You Under My Skin", "Nice and Easy" and "You Make Me Feel So Young". Both attention-grabbing and supportive, his expertly arranged big band accompaniment likewise evokes the ring-a-ding-ding of the Rat Pack era while steering clear of mere pastiche. With a total time just under 40 minutes, the program is a little short by CD standards, but the performances by John Pizzarelli and the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra in this warm tribute to Frank Sinatra are consistently of high caliber and hit the mark every time.
No use thumbing the pages of Cale's elegant scrapbook of an autobiography, 'What's Welsh For Zen?, to glean hard data on this one melodic gem. Coming after the heady, if problematic days of the Velvets, there's barely an acknowledgement of it as he strides into his rock format. The abrasive thrashing rock of 'McBeth'(while indicating his imminent direction) serves the one discordant note. Throughout,Cale namedrops to effect learnedness without destroying the mood of a distant past. Language had been severed from lineal meaning, in rock, since Bob went electric. Pete Brown writing for Jack Bruce's towering masterpieces, 'Songs For a Sailor',  'Harmony Row'; Keith Reid with Procul Harum, were mixing up the lyric medicine, presumably with other pharmacuticals  making sumptuous music on a par with 'Paris 1919'. That date? The birth of Surrealism,(and similar writing to Cale's efforts herein) perhaps? The Russian Revolution? Cale's singing on 1919 had a world weary distance to it, which suited the reflective jabberwocky of the songs; stretched out vowells on,'planing lakes', 'elephants that sing','looking out from here at half past France.' It was far from banal music, however saccharine the orchestral moves from strings, viola  piano Cale painted. These lyrics were baffling but made perfect poetic sense when sung. 'Locusts' was something of a revisiting to this pastoral mood but lacks the roundedness. 'Fragments of a Rainy Season' is a good retrospective concert. And some of the fuge written around the hommage to Andy Warhol is very moving stuff. Go John
This is a fabulous CD and exactly what I was looking for.  I'm also thrilled that it has an accompanying book with all the sheet music.  I am leading a seder this year for a church group who has never heard any of the  songs before, so I wanted the traditional melodies, easy to follow sheet  music, and easy guitar chords.  This is perfect!  I'm so pleased
This is a difficult album to review. People either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced, overblown waste of their time. However, I can say that this is my favorite Oasis album. Why? That's a very good question...maybe because Be Here Now was my introduction to Oasis, and I could tell that this band had a lot to offer, even through the drug-addled, overproduced songs that seemed to last forever. Each one is very catchy and has an overall feel-good quality to it, two characteristics of most Oasis songs. It's no use comparing Be Here Now to Morning Glory or Def. Maybe, because it's in a whole other ballpark. This is Oasis going totally over the top and pushing their music to the limit. No doubt that all the coke helped with that. It's my firm belief that Morning Glory and Def. Maybe were and still are great albums in their own rights. Be Here Now is just something else, you either love it or hate it. It has it's own little Oasis category. I can see why it never really lived up to its two famous predecessors.There are some valid complaints about this album, though. One, it is very very overproduced, filled to the top with snarling buzzing guitars and who knows what else. Unfortunately, this makes it hard to listen to with earphones for very long. Two, the songs are astonishingly long at times. All Around the World, while an excellent song, clocks in at around 9:20. I believe that the shortest song is I Hope, I Think, I Know, coming in at 4:23. So you know you're in for a long, wild ride. However, only Oasis could pull this off - making ridiculously long songs that are almost ear-numbing to listen to - and every minute is made enjoyable. All the arrogance, coke, and swagger in these songs is perhaps what makes it so appealing to some people. And of course, there's that small note on the upper left-hand corner of pages 7 and 8 in the booklet that proclaims : "The Beatles are quite good, but Oasis is much better."And so a resounding yes to all of these: overproduced, arrogant, drug-induced, staggering, amazing, excellent. I don't care about the negative things, though, because that's what makes Be Here Now a sucess in its own right. 
I have been listening to this album for at least 12 years and it rarely leaves my CD changer.  I played the cassette version until it literally would not play any more, and it was one of the first CDs I bought.  A relative first introduced me to this album and of course Coming Up Close was the reason I bought my own copy. But I came to love each song and appreciate Aimee Mann as an exceptionally gifted songwriter.   It is a great Road Trip album and On Sunday makes the perfect Summer Song.  The mix is not mainstream pop/rock.  It is not a 1980's anthem, but it is one of the defining moments, for me.  The lyrics have meaning, which sometimes defies what the '80's were about.  The only other thing I can say is Listen to this CD!  I am sure you will find Mann's unique voice as captivating as I do. It is a definite must have for one's CD library
...and if you're fortunate enough to find it, I recommend buying the version with the bonus DVD, which chronicles the making of Yellow Brick Road.  When I bought it, it cost the same as the 2 SACD set without the DVD, so it was still a great deal.My only complaint--and it's really minor--is that it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album onto a single SACD.  A second disc could have included the bonus tracks that are included in this package, plus any extra--maybe even audio-only interviews--still remaining in the vaults.  No matter.  The important thing, if you are able, is to make sure you have an SACD-compatible player (like the Pioneer DV-563A, or one of the really expensive players if you've got the cash and love audiophile formats in both your hardware and your CDs).  Even if you don't, the stereo CD layer still sounds truly excellent
Did you lose interest in new rock in the past several years because all those loud songs on the FM station sound about the same?  Maybe you noticed one song in there somewhere that had memorable hooks and interesting lyrics among the crunching guitars?  The Libertines are - or at least were - one of those diamonds in the rough.Their raw, loud style is closer to punk than any other genre, but most of their songs are more well-developed than that suggests and might even appeal to classic rock fans.  Make no mistake, though, this is a loud album.  With the exception of the oddly balladish "Radio America," it's a pretty steady sonic assault, and the lyrics are mostly somewhere between "Louie Louie" and live Dylan on the intelligibility scale.  What can be understood is more erudite than you'd expect, though.  "What a Waster" is a frighteningly vivid look at drug addiction, "Boys in the Band" is the best groupie song I've heard in a long time, and "The Good Old Days" actually reveals a touch of sentimentality just under the power chords.  Decipherable or not, most of the other songs are at least very catchy.  The whole collection is a nice balance between aggressive style and memorable songs that has been all too lacking for a long time now. 
About the Band:Dead Can Dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre.  In fact, the name of the label, 4AD, which carried many of the 1990s DCD releases, is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music, which is a fusion of subtle electronics, vocals, drums, world music, and a near limitless count of instruments.  Brendan Perry sometimes has been described as a gothic Frank Sinatra.  Lisa Gerrard's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to Lisa.  I count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem.About the Album:Compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks, the 50-minutes of Into the Labyrinth would seem short, if it weren't for the fact that I like to listen to this album over and over again.  I count this album as one of my all time favorites, and certainly my most prized Dead Can Dance CD.One of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both Lisa's and Brendan's ghostly vocals.  On some tracks they accompany each other, while others feature only one of the artist's chilling or mystical sounding vocals.  Simply put, this is beautiful music to relax to.  I honestly give this album my highest recommendations!Two tracks I'd recommend sampling: "Towards the Within" (featuring Lisa's vox w/ Brendan backing) and "Tell Me About the Forest" (featuring Brendan's vox).  I believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album.  Please note that while all the tracks feature vocals, the lyrics for only those sung in English are included in the liner notes.Similar Artists:Chances are if you aren't yet familiar with Dead Can Dance, that you've not yet discovered some of these other bands, but I highly recommend them as well: Das Zeichen, Impressions of Winter, Love is Colder Than Death, Qntal, Corvus Corax, or Helium Vola.  There is a rather large (and somewhat underappreciated) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to Dead Can Dance.  Please check some of them out as well.
This is by far the best psychopathic album ever released. Riddlebox is now in second place. Madrox schools ever other artist on psychopathic with this album. Beats are bangin' and lyrics are flawless! Great flows and he mixes funny with wicked. Best songs are This B*tch and Hey Phatty. Great album by the best rapper of our time. Madrox is so under rated. I wish for his sake he would blow up huge but not lose his soul in the process. Buy this album, best rap album ever made
Percy Grainger was a man of spectacular gifts. He was one of the most original composer/arrangers in the early part of this century. He was also a spectacular pianist in an age of spectacular pianists. This amazing CD  documents Grainger's formidible gifts. It cannot be over-praised. Both the  music and the performances are well worthy of any piano lover's attention.  Don't miss this one
I own a lot of Waylon Jennings albums but I have to say, I find myself playing this one on 9 out of 10 times. If you want to buy just one Waylon album this is the one to own, the recording quality is brilliant for a live album and the music IS alive.  Simply great, I can't say enough good things about this CD
Considered one of Coltrane's 'searching' periods, this CD has a lot to offer in the way of understanding Trane's restless nature. Never one to stand on laurels, Coltrane does indeed continue to set the bar 'higher' every time out. This one is mostly ballad and blues based, with the exeption of 2 tracks in particular which stand out - on both ends of the Trane spectrum. Track #2, "I Love You" finds him playing furious, cerebral runs on the instrument, and , frankly, not as 'listenable' as one may like; whereas the track with Donald Byrd is as 'in the pocket' as you'll ever hear. All in all, a very realistic look at a genius in motion
I consider this to be one of the finest live Coltrane recordings out there.  It was also one of the first Coltrane albums I picked up, and it was a fantastic gateway to some of his more abstract live recordings on followup releases like LIVE AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD AGAIN and LIVE IN JAPAN.  This is much more similar to AFRO BLUE IMPRESSIONS which is another overlooked release.  By this point in time, Trane had already done some work with Eric Dolphy and his playing was growing in a much more abstract direction as we would hear on A LOVE SUPREME just one year later.One of the reasons why this disc is overlooked is because Elvin Jones is replaced by Roy Haynes, while Jones was serving some jail time.  The absence of Jones is noticeable but I still think this is worthy of five stars.  The first 3 tracks are from the Newport Jazz Festival and in addition to Haynes and Trane, we have the remaining quartet members, McCoy Tyner (piano) and Jimmy Garrison (bass).  Tyner is especially amazing on 'My Favorite Things' which I consider the best version of that piece in Trane's entire catalogue.  I consider it to be a bridge to some of his later recordings.  This is because we get Trane's two sides.  First of all there is great tone and lyricism in the first part of the piece.  However, the song still goes on for 17 minutes and the interplay between Tyner and Haynes for much of it is amazing. Rounding out the performance is Billy Eckstine's 'I Want to Talk About You' with a mesmerizing credenza which is a staple of Trane's technique, followed by a 15 minute version of 'Impressions.'  Again we hear Trane's two sides.  On one hand we hear where he is COMING from. which is the confines of other jazz gods like Miles Davis and Thelonius Monk.  On the the other hand we can see where he is GOING, which is a much more abstract/free-jazz approach.  Once you can begin to understand Trane's more abstract side, you will find later recordings less challenging, such as INTERSTELLAR SPACE, MEDITATIONS, or A LOVE SUPREME.  In addition to the three Newport recordings, there is an extra track from November of 1961 from the Village Vanguard.  'Chasin' Another Trane' is played by Haynes and Trane as well as Dolphy on alto sax and Reggie Workman on bass.  The presence of Dolphy and the removal of piano makes this the most avant-garde piece on the record, almost reminiscent of early Ornette Coleman.  Coltrane really cooks on this record, and the sound quality is also pretty decent.  It's not as crystal clear as his Carnegie Hall concert with Monk, but nevertheless, I consider it a great place to start for Trane fans who are reluctant to embrace his later music.   
This is a compilation, but the original Incense and Peppermints album was really revolutinary for the time. I will date myself now, but I remember hearing this song on the radio in our car and was mesmerized by it. It was the first Lp I had ever bought. I actually wore out the groves on the Lp and came across another a few years ago. To this day, almost 40 years after I first heard the Strawberry Alarm Clock, I still like Incense and Peppermints as well as their other songs. Their style ranges from acid rock to jazz. The musicians are all very talented and the band works as a team as opposed to many of the bands of the era. Their recordings are really high quality and certainly not over processed like a lot of today's music is. SAC was in an era where 60's music was in transition from the early Beatles and old time R sound to a more acid rock sound. Lyrics like 'tune in, turn on, turn your eyes around.. look at yourself' were typical of SAC's lyrical style as well as the thinking of the times. It was an odd time. On one side, we had Woodstock, mini-skirts, muscle cars and fun fun fun, But, on the dark side, there were civil rights problems and the Viet Nam war. This transitional period was a kind of awakening for the country and for music. Although not as popular as names like the Doors, Jefferson Airplane and Steppenwolf, the Strawberry Alarm Clock still had a huge following. My only regret is that I didn't get a chance to see them (or the Doors!) when they came to the city where I lived during the late 60's. This album is a nice compilation of  SAC's hits. The songs are as fresh and original sounding as they were almost 40 years ago.
The CD is truly the very best of Bobby Vee's works.  A delightful CD.  Even my college age children enjoy the music. Really worth the money
This album is ridiculous.  I almost want to say part of SRV's soul is in this guy...he is that good.  Honestly I think this album rips apart his previous two.  My hope is that Jimmy, DT and APO will bring out a 4th release...as good as this album or better!THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GREAT ALBUMS WHERE EVERY SONG IS GOOD. BUY IT.YOU LIKE SRV, BUY IT.Double Trouble must have brought part of SRV back, because this album is just plain sweet
I am not sure about my baby, but I love this CD ! Actually baby loves it too but probably not to that great extent. :-
Purchased this album because of the great Album cover, was I surprised when I popped it into my CD player. I hadn't heard of Rick Braun before but  after listening to this CD, I ran out and purchased everything he has ever  recorded. Never have I heard a trumpet sound so beautiful. Share this music  with someone you love
The first time you play this CD you're just gonna hate it. Promise Ring's third album is the opposite of this. Very Emergency is super catchy and tight but you get sick of it quick, there's just not much there. That understood, this album will rock you for years. It grows on you. At first listen it sounds like really bad emo demos. Like the faceless band you saw open for Fugazi the last time they hobbled into town. No hooks, no choruses, lots of really bad singing and sloppy guitar [with the drums mixed way too loud, an emo thing]. On the 100th listen, if you make it that far, it will sound like an old friend yammerin' on about the good old days. Trust me, it's a desert island disc in the making, I envy those of you just discovering this Cd
If this album didn't come out at its destinated time, 2006 would have been one of the worst years for gospel music.  Outside of Kurt Carr's cd, this album makes singing gospel music worthwhile.  Donald Lawrence knows how to send out a group and bring in a new era of singers.  That's basically what this finale does, it brings into the forefront the future of the gospel music scene.  We have new artists emerging in Blanche (McAlister-not sure if she is going to just do the first name like MaDonna, Cher, Mandisa, ummmmm, think about it!!!!!!!!), DeWayne Woods (thanks for the testimony and great Sunday morning rocking song - this is hint to all church musicians sing this song when church is a lil dead and pick it up), The Murrills, LaJeune Thompson (sang girl), and Sheri from the duo of Ted  Sheri.  There are so many hits on the whole cd from God Is, God, You Are An Heir, Giants, Blessing from Abraham, Encourage Yourself, of course all of the older stuff.  One thing missing is Kelly Price should have guested on I Walk With God or bring back Stephanie Mills. 
The best place to start with the best is at the beginning.  Enya's The Celts (identical to the original 1980s release simply called Enya) is a beautiful collection of music.  Enya is not an artist where you just get the "Best of" album.  Every CD is a best of in itself
Never mind the fact that Jay introduced the jazz world to Charlie Parker. His band rocked! After Basie,nobody swung like McShann. this 2 dis set covers the big band sides and the later 40's small band jump blues sides. Anything by this man is worth listening to. Another great disc by the Proper label, who release wonderful compilations with informative booklets at a bargain price. Highly recommended
Unbelievably and indubitably a bona fide, and fortified roots reggae album! If you don't have Firehouse Rock in your CD collection and you consider yourself a reggae fan, you may need to re-evaluate what you think you know about Jamaican music. The Roots Radics, especially the rythym section, utilize (with supreme efficacy, I might add) and epitomize the manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae "riddims." On top of the Radics, the Wailing Souls add ethereal vocals, while staying masterfully conscious. Firehouse Rock is a beautifully recorded piece of audible Jamaican history and an absolute must have
okay!!!after their debut album,i was like okay,they are sad over the revolution being disbanded.well!!!!fruit at the bottom was like,okay ,we're over it,let's jam!!!i saw the video for are you my baby  on BET!!!THEY WERE JUST TOO FUNKY FOR MTV BACK IN THE DAY!!!!!!!THE ALBUM WAS LIKE A CUP OF YOGURT !!!!!the cream was at the top!!!lolly lollywas like the princest cut-they stormed out of the box with the distorted helium vocals,then are you...baby?,man,hold up!!!!you didn't see it comin'!!!!you knew this is what they were capable of!!!!corey glover of living colour said this was one of his favorite albums!then after the satisfactionblast with jesse johnson,formerly of the time and his own solo work,they slow it down for always in my dreamsthis was the jammm!!!!so melodic and works that just have you thinking about writing you own quiet storm!wendy has always seem to sing from the heart!she believes in the words and on this song,she's showing the listener that love stilland always will exists.form now on,we're oneis my favorite track and i tell you why,lisa!LISA!LISA!SHE'S SO QUIET!WHEN HER VOCALS LEAD,YOU JUST LISTEN!!!!The lyrics and the music are so uplifting,you just soar from the start to the end!this is a special album because they sound like they had fun making it!!!!  you'll have fun listening to it!!!!
You won't stop bobbin yo head until its over.  I bought this when it first  came out and we still bump this at every party we go to and everyone is  happy to hear it, Cougnut is easily as good as biggie ever was, he just  never got the exposure that biggie did
If you enjoyed Explosions In The Sky's last album "The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place", and the songs by the group on the "friday night lights soundtrack", then surely, you shall find love for their newest record "All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone". If you are new to Explosions In The Sky, I can only personally describe their music to you as lush, captivating, graceful, energetic, and highly inspirational art rock instrumentations. Please ignore reviewers who rate this album negatively because they don't like it as much as their last album(yet). "All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone" is different than previous records; It is alot darker, but at the same time hopeful and promising, best listened to on a rainy day or a cold dark night(again, personal description). What more can I say... this is about as beautiful as three guitars and a drum set can sound. My favorite album of 2007 so far.
I first heard Dan singing background vocals on the Jackson Browne album "Late for the Sky".  I was 16.  I went out and bought this album (which I STILL have!!) even though I had never heard it.  I had the pleasure of seeing Dan open for the Eagles at the Spectrum in support of this album in Phila, in 1974; I was a junior in high school.  They all joined in on "Best of My Love" and it just blew mw away. He had this really interesting piece of cloth on his piano.  Few people had heard of him prior to this album. This is by far his BEST album.  It is more rock and roll than the rest of his sappy later work in the 80's and a true songwriting gem.  I can remember singing "Morning Sky" in my friend's Ford on the way to school. You have to listen to it over and over.. "Someone's Been Tellin' You Stories" had a sly sexual rhyme in it that was not played on radio at that time. The musicianship on this album only serve to enhance the quality of the songwriting.  This was the most raw of Dan's albums, and by ar, the most superior.  Sadly, Dan is now fighting advanced prostate cancer (check out his website).  Let's hope he will make a full recovery and record and tour again soon.  This is a must have for anyone who is a fan of any 1970's rock and roll. 
Top to bottom this album has it all - makes you laugh , makes you think , makes you want to dance. I can't wait till mainstream finally catches up and the music industry finally recognizes what a gift Todd Snider is and the talent he posseses. His music  will inspire you to move something whether it's your brain or your bottom! Check him out
I bought this album when it was first released in the 70's. Heaven and Hell was hot item and passed through my senior school from ear to ear amongst 'those kids in the know' in much the same way that a joint would these days. The movements build on a theme throughout the work and reflect the care that went into creating some classical overtures. Only later in life could I get the similarities to Carl Orf and Khachaturian. This is a real masterpiece and a snapshot in time of when Prog really was prog. Listen to it in full and then catalogue alongside Camel's 'The Snow Goose', the original 'Tubular Bells' by MIke Oldfield, 'Brain Salad Surgery' by ELP and finally ' Snowflakes are dancing' by Tomita.  Please dont compare this work to the keybored pop, I chose my spelling, of the 1980's If you enjoy Vangelis, as I do, you might also want to listen to the compositions of Ennio Morricone, he is the man who wrote that great music that follows Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns.
This CD has all of the cuts that you remember from back in the day...you will love it...it is always in my car
Jigga is incredibly hot on this albumBeanie is good to great.Memphis Bleek, is really good on this album, but is overshadowed. His "534" shows how good he is, this album does not. Overall as an album it does a good job of showing off Roc A Fella, but not to much about the Dynasty
The music contained Trout Mask Replica is some of the most unique, acid-drenched art to ever be pressed. The songs on the album are mainly divided into folkish a capella tunes and the crazed jams the Captain and his band are known for. Several strange, unconventional themes are visited and revisted throughout the track list, such as bulbs, gingham, trout, and a variety of other surreal, sensously described wildlife. However, if there's any reason to buy Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica, it's to listen to the album as a whole. I find it difficult to listen to any other way. While I find this to be true, I do have favorites that I go to when introducing friends to the Captain, or simply jamming out to without dedicating myself to the full experience: "Ella Guru", "Dachaus Blues", "Dust Blows Forward", "Neone Meat Dream", and "Old Fart at Play" stick out
....and secured their musical legacy.  The Real Thing was a solid rock/rap mixture with newly hired Mike Patton providing vocals.  On Angel Dust, Patton had a lot more creative input, providing his wonderful vocal stylings and schizophrenic persona to Faith No More.  It's a joyous ride that after a less than stellar performance initially, has become something of a cult classic and favorite among many newer acts - and with good reason.  This album is all over the board.  Land of Sunshine reads like a list of fortune cookies (which is the supposed inspiration), while Caffeine is an anthem for Patton's drug of choice, and one of FNM's most energetic recordings.  Then there is the occaisonal oddball track showing Patton's range and sense of fun, like RV, which is like a melancholic rant from the stereotypical figure you might find living in an RV.  Not exactly bilboard material, but fun.Adding to the record were the internal tensions of the band.  Jim Martin was having creative differences, yet pumps out some of his best work here.  Tensions may have fueld a more agressive record, and FNM would never sound better than they do on this album.  It's the bands chemistry - both good and bad - that make this album work.  Commercially, this might have not been the hit the record company wanted, but its legacy can still be heard today and it's still a great record to crank up for a drive, barely showing its 15 year old age
One reviewer remarked that Morten Veland had done it again.  Yup, he shot himself in the foot again, just like he did on Tristania's Beyond the Veil.  Veland has an obvious talent in songwriting and building arrangements, and he definitely has a knack for surrounding himself with quality musicians.  His problem is that rather than using his death metal growling for proper effect, where it's appropriate, he just plasters it everywhere, and again lessens what would otherwise have been an incredible CD.  With all of the talent that is present in this band, it would certainly have been better to let them come out of the background a little more.  The songs where Veland does that (which are all too few), like On the Wane, are easily the CD's best moments.  To the band's credit, the songs are more varied than on BOTV, with some of the guitar parts sounding like more traditional heavy metal riffs (especially at the beginning of the opening track).  It's definitely still melodic goth-metal, but shows some new directions for Veland, which I find promising.  Now, if he would just cut back on the growling...say to 50% of the CD...Sirenia's next CD will be a sure winner
If you have never heard Book Of Shadows by Zakk Wylde, then you may be suprised by this album. The two albums are similiar in that they contain a lot more acoustic guitar, and although I'm not saying that past releases have not contained emotion, HM VI contains more.For example, take 'She Deserves a free ride' and the ballad 'Fear'. The piano on this album is superb, haunting at one point and almost relaxing at another. However, there is just enough of past 'metal' BLS in this album - 'Crazy or High' and 'House Of Doom'. Personal favourites are 'Damage is Done', 'Layne' and 'Queen Of Sorrow'. There is something more in the solo's - they come in at just the right time and as usual are perfectly executed - check out 'Stepping Stone' for an example. The musicianship has got even better on this album, with the dodgy drums on 1919 Eternal Gone, and the bass that was pushed to the background in The Blessed Hellride is up there with Zakk's playing.This album is deep, moving piece that is the perfect successor to the blistering Blessed Hellride. Can't wait for the new Mafia CD to be released.
i just purchased this album, my first misfits album and every song on it rocks (i especially like where eagles dare).  i just bought two more albums, walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait.  my only complain is the sound quality.  it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking...but i guess that makes it sound more real too.  metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same. 
I usually don't do album reviews but I gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and I was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine I call The Sauce So many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings.  Word of mouth is bliss. A-G-2-A-KE who came out on Rap-A-Lot hasn't come out with a cd since this classic.  I'm salty they didn't make it because this was heavily slept on
"Vangelis: Themes" is a collection of some rare and some more popular theatrical theme music from movies including "Blade Runner" and "Mutiny On the Bounty." It's an extraordinary album and I highly recommend it
For the past few years it has been very difficult to locate Candid jazz CDs, the label that critic Nat Hentoff created over forty years ago. This was a real shame because some classic recordings, including Booker Little's "Out Front" and Max Roach's "We Insist!: Freedom Now Suite," were on this label. I am happy to report that it was not because all of the albums were being deleted, but because they were (slowly) being remastered. Now some of the seminal early recordings of iconoclastic pianist Cecil Taylor are resurfacing, like "Jumpin' Punkins" and now "The World of Cecil Taylor." It is my opinion that Taylor's currently unavailable (at least domestically) "New York City R" and "World of C.T." are two of the great new jazz recordings of the early 60s. "World," recorded over two successive days in October 1960, is basically a trio date, with Buell Neidlinger on bass and Dennis Charles on drums, and Archie Shepp joining on tenor sax for two tracks, "Air" and the standard "Lazy Afternoon." This disc is one of Shepp's first recorded performances and the saxman apparently had trouble with Taylor's music -- I recall the now out of print Mosaic set of this material collecting some 15 plus outtakes of "Air." But the master takes are truly masterful, and I am delighted that with this CD available once again, we can all return to "The World of Cecil Taylor.
If you are looking for true HIP-HOP, this is a MUST for your collection. Four of the Best lyrist in the game is all on one CD. Quit buying those fake ass HIP-POP albums and get the real deal. From the production to mcing its all there.  Matter facts get 2 albums so when the first one is used up you'll have a fresh one in the stacks. 
I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You, what more can you say about the greates soul album of all time. This album released all of the music in Aretha that was screaming to be released. It displayed a very mature Aretha with complex emotions, very everyday lyrics, ones that make you say, oh yeah girl, lol. but also a delivery that the average person couldn't lay down and dream about pulling off. This is just testiment that, even at such a young age, she was THE QUEEN
Dj Shadow is in my honest opinion one of the most overlooked artists in music today. Threading the thin line between commercial and underground, and finding his niche somewhere in between (as UNKLE says, the middle ground between light and shadow) DJ Shadow continues to impress with every release he puts forth. I was fortunate enough to pick this album up right after its release, and actually purchased it before I bought Endtroducing, which is by far DJ Shadow's best album, and one of the best albums ever made. By sampling elements from just about anywhere Shadow combines elements from our pop culture to create mini-movies of his songs which few artists can touch in terms of sheer production value, and the emotional effect that is created while listening to his music. I am actually glad I bought this album before Endtroducing as it has given me the time to truly appreciate this album for what it is; a work of art, and a continual growing of Shadow's talents. Had I bought Endtroducing before this and writtwn a review I'm sure I would have garnered it with a 4 star review, but that is simply not the case here. While Endtroducing is always going to be leaques above and beyond this album, Josh Davis has found a way here to go above and beyond what should be expected of an album, and given us an album that I'm sure years from now I will still find elements in it that will grow even more on me with time. Best enjoyed while driving or relaxing at home (possibly with a little mary in tow, if you know what I mean), the songs fluctuate with peaks and valleys of highs and lows, and the beats are flawless, especially when compared to a lot of the mainstream garbage that is put out in the record industry on a regular basis. See the thing is that Shadow bases his music upon how he feels, and artists that do this correctly achieve an emotional reaction from their music that the true artists of our world truly achieve. Radiohead for example has a way of doing this, and it is not surprising then that one of DJ Shadows favorite artists is Radiohead, they both fuse these elements into their music, and achieve monumental status in my opinion. The package design is equally well done as well showing an artists eye for presentation, and a graffiti influenced design to the overall package. If you enjoy this album then I highly recommend any of Shadows works: Endtroducing, Preemptive Strike, The Private Press, and In Tune and On Time, which is a live set recorded in support of this album. UNKLE is also a well thought out album which bridges the gap between hip-hop, rock and techno, with guest appearences by Mike D of the Beastie Boys, Thom Yorke from Radiohead, and others from throughout the music industry. If you've never heard of DJ Shadow before, then I must say that you are missing out, if you are at all interested in underground music, do yourself a favor and pick up any of Shadow's albums or collaborations, I guarantee you will extremely impressed, as with any good album the songs have a way of growing on you over time. Peace out
Though I own alot of Paul Desmond recordings, this one as been in the CD changer for weeks now.  There's great, gentle interplay with Jim Hall, and a total sound that is most enjoyable.  Warm and round notes make this  perfect evening music which I have found pleases most everyone
This music is undefinable ultimately. Oh yes, one can say parts sound like hard rock or progressive. One can say many things about it. For me, this, along with "Up the Downstairs" are probably their two best and they are both as different as night and day. I've become a collector of PT's stuff and like most of it very much indeed. Check out some of the side projects of the members in the band--like Blackfield and No-Man. They are worth good listenings too. But, you know, this wouldn't be a bad album to start your PT experience with. No, not at all
Jeff Beck is far from the typical rock guitarist. He never took the easy path of showing how fast or virtuoso he is. Instead, he is full of intriguing and explosive ideas that make you want to listen  to this CD over and over again. That's what musicianship is all about, and Jeff has plenty of it
This cd is the funniest cd i own.  The first half of the cd is pure comedy and super funny.  The second half is a little hard to understand, and it louds like is was recorded poorly, that is why i gave it four stars.  Track 2 is worth the money spent on the cd because that track is 8 mins of pure comedy.  Eddie makes fun of Stevie Wonder and boxer Larry Holmes, and he does it well
This collection of Italian Cello Sonatas by the great Janos Starker is one of the most delightful chamber albums I own.  The world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966 recording by pianist Stephen Swedish on five of the selections, and by his frequent collaborator Gyorgy Sebok on the Bach Sonata in G minor, which was recorded in 1963 and added to this collection to increase its length (it is a welcome addition musically too).  The selections here range from famous composers like Bach, Boccherini and Vivaldi, to the lesser known Corelli, Locatelli and Valentini.  For me, the common thread of this recording is the passionate performances of Starker.  Whether it is the happy bounce of the Vivaldi Allegro, the sublime rendering of the Boccherini Adagio, or the precise interplay with Sebok on the Bach Sonata, Starker plays masterfully and his cello is captured in rich, full sound by the Mercury Living Presence recording technique.  This is an excellent purchase for all cello enthusiasts
Another solid 70's band that faded into obscurity. The nice thing about living in Canada was that we got to see all of the minor as well as the major acts. Edward Bear fell between the two. The original members got together in the late sixties and took their name from a more famous bear named Winnie. All of their hits are here as well as a cover of "Freedom for the Stallion" , a song that was also covered by "The Hues Corporation" and popularized by "Three Dog Night". Its mostly the type of music that most will remember a favourite love by from "The Last Song" to "Close Your Eyes" (I'm back again). A good middle of the road pop album to melt back the years
I love "Fool For The City" I have also always loved Savoy Brown "Looking In" and didn't know until recently that Lonesome Dave was the singer and most of the Savoy Brown band went on to form Foghat. If you are a Foghat fan you should check out "Looking In" by Savoy Brown. If you've heard other stuff by Savoy Brown and didn't like it, don't be discouraged because "Looking In" (and only "Looking In") is essentially Foghat. There were a lot of changes in Savoy Brown personnel through the years and the guys that did Looking In were the best.
I drive alot commuting to and from my job. This music has served as the perfect backdrop to an lovely Indiana fall! I'm sure I'll recall those colorful images as I continue to listen to this CD through the colorless days of winter
Joe Cocker has one of the most distinctive gravelly voices in R  B history.  He's always stuck to his roots and never gone with temporary fads or novelties.  This collection is another classic with great covers from the Beatles, Elton John and Gary Wright.  His interpretive voice has always been the focal point of his songs, but in DTS 5.1, you are surrounded (as if in concert) by his presence.   The completely adept and intuitive musicians that accompany him add more atmosphere without taking from his performance.  Imagine hearing him in live in a theater and you'll know what to expect from this warm and heartfelt album
The Living In Oblivion series of CD compilations does something that many similar compilations do NOT do: they give us some great variety of "hits".There is no doubt that "Mickey" by Toni Basil was a huge hit. There's also no doubt that "Our Lips are Sealed" was a break out hit for the Go Go's, but the Funboy Three version wasn't. But what about "Living in a Box"? It only hit the Billboard top 100 at #89 in 1987. So why is it here? Why are a large number of these songs? They're not top 10 hits, right?Wrong!I'm sick to death of so many compilations relying on top 40 hits from the 80's. The U.S. music tastes are typically very different from those of Europe. Just because a song doesn't make the U.S. Billboard top 40 doesn't mean that it isn't a hit in other countries. And although I'm an American, my music tastes have always run more in line with those of Europe.I'm delighted that the Living in Oblivion series (and the Pop and Wave series) have incorporated a variety of hits from the U.S. and Europe. I also like that some of the more obscure groups and their songs are available on these compilations. There are several songs on these albums that never were released on CD (as they hadn't come into being at the time of the groups' albums initial releases), so albums such as these are the only place where you can find these hits. The Boys Don't Cry song "I Wanna Be a Cowboy" hit the Billboard charts at #12 in 1986, but the group disappeared soon thereafter. Then all of a sudden a dance version of that same song came out in the early 2000's and rocketed up the dance charts. Don't be misled, the Living in Oblivion series is one of the absolutely best series for a variety of music from the 80's. If you want to hear run of the mill, top 40 only hits from the 80's, well, then you'll just have to look elsewhere.Also, the liner notes and pictures of the groups included in the jewel box are really clever. You get to find out what the chart position was for the songs in the compilation and see what the groups looked like at the time of the song's release. My only issue with these liner notes is that the author of them seems to be disparaging the very music which these albums are espousing. Apparently many believe that the music from the 80's was vacuous and devoid of emotion. One need only listen to the song "The Promise" by the group "When in Rome"  (Living in Oblivion Volume 5) to know that such a statement is false. While that group only had this one hit and then faded into obscurity, "The Promise" made the Billboard Top 100 at #11 and the Billboard Dance Chart at #1.Anyway... I can't recommend this album and its entire series any more! It's simply awesome! Before believing those who would disparage this series of albums, please check the Billboard charts and you'll see that these songs were in fact hits.GET IT
You have not heard his voice until to have heard Andras Schiff play the Well Tempered Clavie
"The guitars aren't loud enough, and neither is the bass for that matter"Which is so true, but it's still a great album. Seeing them live, makes up for this CD no doubt.Stand out songs:-The City Sleeps In Flames-The World As We Know It -Just A Taste -My Darkest Hour -Empty Glasses -The Only Medicine'My Darkest Hour'  'Empty Glasses' are my favorites. I know those songs by heart
While not every song my be my favorite, they really did a great job compiling the popular and favorites from the great 80s hair band days!All the monster CDS I have bought have been real gems.
First of all i'm a die hard UFO fan,i own EVERY UFO album not just the michael shenker cd's...some of you fools reviewing the ufo albums without michael ..1) do the band a disservice 2)are smokin crack, and 3) are very inept in your musical judgement. While i'm a huge shenker fan he is far from the greatest guitar god,and i hate to break the news to ya's but for overall sound/effect and appeal paul chapmans just good as michael on many a song. That bein said MAKING CONTACT is one of the top five UFO albums MADE!!!! the top five UFO albums any fan should get are (PHENOMENON,LIGHTS OUT,NO PLACE TO RUN,MAKING CONTACT,and WALK ON WATER) along with the two live cd's BBC,and strangers in the night. Misdemeaner has some cool 80's guitar and is an attempt at mainstream(and they deserve to be mainstream) so who can blame them,and some of these songs are pretty cool...IF,I might add if you have an open mind (so that excludes most of you shenker diehards)...........
A truly glorious recording, just what I want in music, with brilliancy, sensitivity, and beauty. This is a must have for every music lover worth the name
Her voice takes my breath away, I fell in love with her.I highly reccomend it
This is truly one of the great jazz albums of all time. Surprisingly, Evans' introspective style and Cannonball's soulful approach meld together perfectly. Perhaps this is testament to just how hugely talented these men are. Both The technical skill and pure musicmanship displayed on this record is just amazing. I've owned this CD for over 10 years now and still find so much to listen to in these recordings. Highlights are the amazing Waltz For Debby and Earl Zindars' waltz Elsa, easily one of the most beautiful songs ever written, in my opinion. You simply cannot go wrong with this CD
I remember thinking when this film came out that few things in life were as cool as Lloyd Dobler. This soundtrack is also one of those things. This album for me, as for many I'm sure, somewhat reflected my taste in music at the time, and even now actually. Of course the biggie here is "In Your Eyes" from Peter Gabriel. Who hasn't that track touched at some point? This also confirmed my love for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and here we get a slightly extended version of their classic "Taste The Pain". Toss on a few from Fishbone, Living Colour, and The Replacements and you solidify this soundtrack as a must own for the late 80's alt-rock lover. Not to mention the goods from Depeche Mode and Nancy Wilson (Heart). In fact the only thing that could've made this album any better, is if it ended with a "ding"
This era of Tangerine Dream (TD) was just great. The Virgin Years were truly a great period for TD. For me it deals with space and landscape. It's so close to repetitive music that would come much later. It's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies. You could fly with them and end up with more in the end. You can't say that for too many of these Electronic groups. After that period they would go on with this ambient music that wasn't up to the same standards. It seems they are back (with other musicians of course) with the same kind of concept. Great! They were an important link on the electronic scene. A great album! A great period
Good Stuff! An excellent collection of original and classic gypsy jazz tunes, artfully performed by Jorgenson. I recommend it as an introduction to the virtuosity of John Jorgenson and the genius of Django Reinhardt
I would like to point out that MTV rocks is funny and you guys are suckers. This album does rule, just not as much as top40 radio hits
Let me the say that the vocals on this cd may be painful at first, yet you get over them very quickly, except for a few spots. Even so, they do not lower my score for the album, and at times are quite catchy.Savage - Good riffs, good solos, catchy, purely driven madness to start this insane album. 93/100Where My Fortune Lies - the intro is absolutely nuts, and the highlight of the song. Probably my least favorite after this, yet the solos are still out of this world. 87/100Ninja - what a great song! The intro is one of the greatest things I have heard in my life, and this song may actually have you humming along at points. NINJA! Very well laid out, and the solos at the end are the best so far on the album. Brilliance. 97/100Concerto - Amazing once again, and Becker the 17 year old prodigy showcases himself throughout. He proves he is the master of sweeping and arpreggios all over this album, and this song is an insane instrumental that captures melodies like none other. More notes played in 4 1/2 minutes than in George Harrison's entire career. 98/100Burn the Ground - fastest on the album solo wise in fact Becker is so fast it is hard to believe that its human. Very melodic too except when there are vocals, the song is kinda of disgusting. 87/100Desert Island -another amazing song very well laid out with great solos and great riffs.  The outro is the perfect intro to Speed Metal Symphony. The vocals are actually good on this song, like Ninja., an entertaining song. 97/100 Speed Metal Symphony - nine minutes of shredding and arpreggios and all kinds of melodic madness that is beauty to any shredder's ears. Everything about this song is good. 97/100There isn't much to say about this album except Becker and Friedman show they are true masters of their instruments and are able to play in a melodic and listenable way. I would recommend this over Yngwie Malmsteen, who has not improved since his first album
I'm not particularly familiar with Sonic Youth and the bits I've heard from their other albums haven't really grabbed me.  This does.  The rhythm section wouldn't be out of place in pseudo-tribal funk, the guitars are dissonant, jangling, sometimes hypnotically repetitive, and just plain weird, and the vocals are distant, airy, lazy.  Some of the best music I've heard in a good long while
This is pure inspirational quintessential Oteil and the Peacemakers. It's Gospel, funk, jazz, rock... features his distinctive scatting and amazing bass, a wonderful blend of talent... glorious vocals... You will not regret this purchase... it's a joy all the way through from beginning to end..
i've been waiting for this one.this disc and this group period was funky.movin was one of the baddest instrumental jams that i've ever heard period.can you see the light is a tight jam as well.one of the many bad  groups from back in the day
This film came out in 1973 and I saw it in its original full length version (about 3hours and 15 min.) Executives from Columbia Pictures were there, it was the premeire, and they were groaning and at the intermission fights broke out(verbal) and ushers passed among them and myself and everyone else with soundtrack albums. The executives left the theatre and scaled the albums across Columbus Circle in Boston and I and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for free. We returned to the film and I have always loved this crazy redition of Lost Horizon, the miscasting, the terrible sets, the odd ball music for the story, the dubbed Liv Ullmann, the dance routines of Olivia Hussey..all of it. You cannot find a musical like it, or a soundtrack like it. Columbia execs were unimaginative; they should have believed in this film. The next day after this premeire in Boston, New York etc. (simultaneous I suppose) the film was cut, the posters were taken down..there was a ton of material to buy..T Shirts, dolls, posters of all sizes, bath towels with the poster on them, records of the sd tk of course, and small pop up sets of the entire film. It was to be a massive hit..In two days time all of the paraphanalia was removed, and the posters said, Last Two Weeks, and in two weeks the whole thing disappeared.But many people came to see it..lines of people, and, when they heard it had been cut, they gave up, and in two weeks everyone said farewell to this film. I have many treasures from that opening nite, and now I have the CD of the sound track. Anyone who loves movie magic or madness has to see and hear this film; it is unique.Enjoy this soundtrack and get your hands on a DVD ..they are out there
Toad The Wet Sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties. They wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable. BUT, there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste. My fave song is 'Is It For Me'. It is hard to classify them though. It sort of deep and meaningful (at most times) pop rock. Other good tracks include Walk On The Ocean, Pray Your Gods and I Will Not Take...etc. I regard this album and 'Dulcinea' as their two best albums
This is a glorious recording of one of the most lyrical, haunting scores ever composed for a film. Each succeeding track is a treat for the ears, refreshing and invigorating. Neeley and Varese Sarabande should be congratulated for recording and releasing this hirtherto neglected gem.In my opinion, though, the only part of the entire CD that doesn't work is the beginning of the "Waxworks" track - the score to this particular moment in the film (when Norma, watching herself onscreen, rises triumphantly to proclaim "I'll be up there again, so help me!") is one of the most powerful and recognizable images in filmdom. In the original, the music is strong, powerful and almost spine-tingling, but this moment on the CD is underwhelming and not fully realized. However, what is one misfire (totalling all of eight bars, at most) compared to the richness and texture of the rest of the recording?!In short, if you love film music, you most likely love the score to SUNSET BOULEVARD - and if you love SUNSET BOULEVARD, then you will most likely love this recording, too
Maiden had evolved into a new metal standard in 1986. Not only did they lead the metal world with the greatest artwork on covers, but their music took a new form and justifed everything they had done in the past. Iron Maiden to Powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard classic.  The CD Starts out with CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME, a galloping bassline, and parallel guitar make it, not only a classic, but ahead of its time. The rest of the CD id in pure form. My favorite track, however, is ALEXANDER THE GREAT. The intro starts out with a whisper of that era, and slowly builds to the howl of, I feel, the battle cry of the great warrior of History.  Iron Maiden did not dissapoint with this CD. It is very well mixed and produced, and remains a standard in my collection of CD's.
I have been looking for a particular song for several years.  This album had it
With Engines of Creation, Joe Satriani did what he has always done: make the most of the tools he chooses to use. Only this time, he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar. It would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy who wrote "Satch Boogie," "War" and "Flying in a Blue Dream" went. Well, he's still here, only more than ever he's showing us his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey. I've never heard robots having sex, but I'm willing to be "Borg Sex" isn't far off. And although his calmly passing, sometimes noodling melodies appear to have little structure, that's kinda how you'd expect to see "Clouds Race Across the Sky." The 'chorus' to "Devil's Slide" sounds as sinister as its name suggests and "Attack" is as close to a musical sci-fi battle as I've ever heard. To top it off, the album includes "Until We Say Goodbye," one of Satch's best ballads in his entire catalogue.If you're willing to put a little more mental energy into appreciating the work Satch put into this album than just waiting for the album to rock your socks off Surfing With The Alien-style, you'll find that there's an incredible amount of depth -- and musicianship -- to be found. It's not a Satriani masterpiece, but its a true testament to the man's enduring creativity
His playing on this album reminds me of that of Bill Evans.  I am glad to see on reading all the reviews that someone else had that exact thought.  Comparison to Bill Evans is the best compliment I know how to give
I owned this as an LP and played it over and over on my tiny, mono phonograph.  I loved it then and I love it now. Rainmaker, I'm On My Way Back Home and Love Is All That I Ever Needed would all have been sucessful singles. I Would Have Loved You Anyway is the only song I don't really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny. All the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that's ok! The background singers get a tad tiring but Go David Cassidy! I don't care if it's the memories or not, I enjoy putting this on and turning it up
I am amazed what this program can do. It is a big difference from PS 5.5. It is a new learning curve but well worth it. What used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes. Amazon had the best price for me from a source I trust ordering from. It is worth it
I concur with the review that points up the problems with Adobe's new "license manager" method of activation. When you pay as much as you do for this app, or the entire suite, you should not be faced with complete lockup should you have hardware problems, or can't connect to the Internet from "location shooting." I took one star off for this egregious marketing tactic.That said, this version of Photoshop is superb, an otherwise 5-star app. If you take the time to use the tutorials included in the help (used to be separate folders, with chapters 1 - 4 of the Classroom In A Book, but no more alas), or get one of Deke McClelland's fine tomes and do all the lessons, there is nothing in this app that the novice can't start to use from Day One. With today's point  shoot cameras packing more resolution, and more manual control, into their functions, use of Photoshop becomes more than just a hobby. You can really "rescue" photos that are too dark, too bright, exceedingly color-shifted, from the "cut" folder and still make prints. Further, the Camera RAW functionality allows anyone with a sufficiently functional digicam to touch up snapshots into fine photography.A warning: you need the fastest processor you can afford (a Core Duo or Quatro will be superb), and as much RAM as your system can take. There is an optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance on systems with more than 1 Gigabyte of RAM. You need AT LEAST that much under Windows XP to get good performance out of PS CS2. If you can use 2GB or more dual-channel memory, that's even better (the dual-channel RAM adds a small boost when handling large file sizes, e.g. Camera RAW image sources). If you don't have these, don't expect Photoshop to act fast. Adobe Bridge is a major improvement for this version. It offers superior file and image management functions, and can even do batch editing on images. You can even perform Camera RAW adjustments right from Bridge. Bridge can perform batch processes WHILE YOU EDIT IN PHOTOSHOP. If that isn't cool, I don't know what is. If you doubt me, check out Deke McClelland's PHOTOSHOP CS2 ONE-ON-ONE tutorial for his chapter on using Adobe Bridge. His video introduction (included on a DVD in the book), and chapter on using and customizing Bridge, are terrific introductions.If you're a user of versions 5.x (as I was), 6, or 7, upgrading to CS2 is a no-brainer. Don't wait. Get it now before the Adobe License Manager gets worse in 2007
Simply the best software out there for digital photographers, graphic designers and anything having to do with digital image creation and manipulation. Packed with features for novices to professional advanced users. The only limits are your imagination
Adobe Photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business.  It's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user.  There is, however, a plethora of texts, tutorials, learning guides, and even video's to help abate the learning curve
I was afraid at first not to order directly from Adobe but decided to take the cheaper route. It was obviously worth it - everything arrived perfectly - wrapped up, original CD set, etc.Shipped in record time as well.Eyal
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice  ignoramus than I. Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used. Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty. Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9. Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program. I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen. But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle. When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW! What an overall improvement!! Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close. With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool. The intuitive menus are nice too. Also cool is that all the text  paragraph and fill  stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them. Aaaahh! Finally some help for dunces like me. Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool. The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted. But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on. I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the confounding quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all. The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics. And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions. Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience. But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet. The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs. In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional design stuff but not for a living. But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9. Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone.
If you're one of those people like me, who hang on to an older version of the application waiting for the right time, now is the time to upgrade.  You won't be disappointed.  Just ask the editors of both PC Magazine and C|Net which awarded this version their Editor's Choice Award.Once again Adobe has listened to its loyal customer base.  The proof is in the new version of Illustrator.  Many of our requests were answered with the latest version including some that we didn't even think of.  I was happy to find out that even with the new features, Adobe has not altered Illustrator's previous palettes or keyboard commands.  There's nothing worse than having a shortcut or command memorized for years and then it gets changed with a new version.  No fear here!First of all, I want to say that I am really impressed with the Live Trace and Live Paint features, especially when used together.   We all know that sometimes ideas hit us when we least expect it and are away from our beloved computer.  We end up drawing it out on a napkin, paper towel or the unused envelope from our glove compartment.  Normally, once you get back to your computer you have to try to redraw your graphic using Illustrator which takes both time and effort---not any more.Take your napkin masterpiece to your scanner and scan it in.  Once the image has been scanned, then the fun begins.  Once the image has been scanned in and brought into Illustrator CS2, use the Live Trace feature to actually trace your drawing.  This feature actually turns to drawing into a Live Trace object for easy manipulation.  After applying some blurring as needed, your traced image is cleared up.  Then, convert your Live Trace object into a Live Paint object using the new Control Palette.  I like the Live Paint tool also because it reminds me of working in Photoshop.Once you've converted to the Live Paint object, you can easily use the pen and other tools to modify any points to your liking.  Live Paint also has a feature called Gap Detector which can prevents paint from going over into other sections because of a break in a line.  This is a handy feature that keeps you from having to fix overspill later.  When the object outlines are finalized, use the Live Paint feature to easily fill any region with color.  Voila!  You are done.  Go from napkin to art in a matter of minutes.A concern of many of us for years was the fact that while Illustrator keep getting better and newer features, it also mean more and more palettes.  Sometimes it became a little unmanageable.  However, the pros at Adobe recognized this problem and applied a solution - the Control palette.  This new palette sits at the top of the screen.  First, it acts as a an object inspector providing information.  Secondly, (and more importantly), the Control palette provides easy access to fill and stroke dropdown menus, brush shape, opacity, and style.  No longer do you have to fumble through your palette to get at these frequently used features.  If you are fans of Adobe's other Creative Suite 2 software, you will be pleased to learn that the Control Palette is apart of their new makeover too.Here are some more new additions and changes to Illustrator:*	Like Photoshop, Illustrator CS2 now supports custom workspaces.  You can display only the palettes you need at any time. You are also able to access or save any workspace at any time or use workspace templates.*	Adobe has improved the Swatch and color integration.  Now, working with the other Creative Suite 2 programs is seamless.*	Isolation Mode is a feature that allows you to double-click a group move and edit internal objects without having to search through the Layers Palette.*	CS2 now supports all of the latest Wacom tablets. It now provides brush support for the new Wacom 6D Art Pen and adds a new dimension Illustrator's Calligraphic and Scatter brushes*	Adobe Bridge integration is now a part of Illustrator CS2.  Bridge allows you to easily manage images through thumbnails for better workflow.*	Macromedia Flash exports are now available.  You can export both text and objects as Flash files which result in smaller file size and easier incorporation into web projects.*	You can now open Photoshop files with layer comps within Illustrator.  This new feature allows you to view many versions of a layout at one time, just as you do in Photoshop*	Custom stroke placement is a new addition to Illustrator. You can now place strokes on the outside, inside or center of a path.*	Underline and Strikethrough are two of over 170 new type enhancements.*	These are a few of the new features!The $169 upgrade cost is well worth the money, just for the Live Trace and Live Paint features alone.  However, you get so much more in the new Illustrator CS2.  Upgrade now and be completely satisfied.  If you haven't purchased a vector graphics program, get Illustrator, especially if you are already an owner of a version of Photoshop.  This new version of Illustrator even looks more like the familiar Photoshop layout.Loren ElksGroup Manager, D-MAG.org
The product is easy to use.  Like how it intergrates with MS Office applications.  It's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients
I've been frustrated for quite some time now with having Adobe Reader and expecting it should do what Adobe Acrobat can do.  I was especially interested in creating PDF's (Portable Document Formats)of Word documents.  Although I have Photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way, I wasn't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so.  Faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook, aptly named, "Death by Cholesterol", I felt justified in finally purchasing not only "Acrobat" but also "OmniPage", an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.  With these programs in hand it made the project fun to do.  Now I have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page PDF file that can be read and also printed out by anyone I care to send it to over the Internet.  It's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though I've only used a small part of its capabilities.  The reason that I've only given it a "4" rating?  I'm upset that I didn't get the full version, but I can't justify doing so.  I'm being petulant
I have been using Adobe Acrobat for a few years now.  I've used both their Professional and Standard versions.  Now, Adobe has released Acrobat 7.  In this review, I will be discussing primarily the features of the Standard edition.  However, these features are also available in the Professional edition.  Outside of the fact that the Professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features, these programs are the basically same.  I have noted any features available only in Professional in this review.  First, what is PDF and what can it do for me?Adobe's PDF is now a universal format that allows you to preserve the look and integrity of your original documents - Adobe PDF files look exactly like the original pages and fulfill requirements for electronic filing and document security.Not only that, but you can share the files with anyone, whether on a PC or a Mac.  Each PDF file has the graphics and fonts imbedded into the file.  The user of  the file does not have to have the same font set, nor even purchase Adobe Acrobat, because the Reader version of Acrobat is free!New Features in Acrobat 7*	Turn MS Outlook email into searchable documents.  This is a great feature.  It allows you to effortlessly turn those old emails into the universal PDF format.  Acrobat's searching capabilities make even searching through the longest emails easy and accurate.*	Attaching source files.  Previously, we have been able to create  PDFs from spreadsheet and other formats.  Now, not only can you do that, but this new feature allows you to attach the documents with the PDF!*	Improved Browser.  Acrobat's browser has been improved to make searching for documents easier.  If you are familiar with the Adobe Photoshop browser, you'll like the new upgraded browser in Acrobat 7.*	Searching improved.  The search feature has been improved when you are looking for files.  It is easier to search for files, because now Adobe has made the feature more friendly.  You can search by document and text properties on your local computer or across your companies LAN or WAN networked drives.More About AcrobatAlthough many people are familiar with the Acrobat Reader program, they are not as familiar with Acrobat itself.  I consult will many business persons and they are just astounded at what Acrobat 7 can actually do for their business.  Just the fact that you can collect and assemble output from different types of programs into on universal format floors them every time!  Another great point about assembling the documents in Acrobat is the compression factor.  With Acrobat, users are able to compress the original documents, thus saving space and making it more efficient to transmit the documents via email or internet downloads.This new version can now also create, and save "PDF/A" files for archiving and it allows users to  scan paper documents directly into a searchable PDF file saving space and time.  Many companies around the country are making the jump to the "paperless" environment.  Acrobat 7 can definitely help.In fact, I know of an attorney's office making great use of Acrobat.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.  Even legal documents can be approved, digitally signed and verified in Acrobat.Anyone concerned about the security of their documents has nothing to fear.  Acrobat's security features including the ability to create self-signed digital IDs are terrific; no matter if you have PDF documents loaded on your website for downloading to clients or if you are emailing the files.  For Professional users, Adobe has added a new feature called E-envelopes.  With the new E-Envelopes, user can package their PDF files in an encrypted wrapper and send those files securely via email.  For company networks, Adobe has also added support for your company-wide security policies using a new feature called Lifecycle Policy Service.  The granularity of the security allows the user to pick exactly what they will allow the recipient of the file to do like printing, copying, pasting and so on.  Many people are also surprised that Acrobat isn't just for static documents.  Users can create interactive forms (Professional Only) as well.  In fact, I know a client who is an attorney.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.For CAD and graphics professionals who work with 3D files, Acrobat 7 (Professional Only) can now convert these into PDF format for ease of viewing, whether in electronic or printed format.  This will allow the users to quickly send their clients views of the 3D object in the universal PDF format without the purchase of additional software for the recipient of the file.Another feature is the new licensing capability that Adobe has added to Acrobat 7.  You can install the program and activate it on two separate computers, which is great if you work at home and at the office as well.  Need to install it on a third computer?  Not a problem.  The transfer activation feature allows you to transfer the license to another computer.  To do this, deactivate one copy and transfer the activation via a simple menu command. If your computers have internet access, the change happens right away.  This feature alone may save users money on purchasing multiple copies of the software.SummaryI would highly recommend this product to anyone in business.  The easy of use and versatility of Adobe Acrobat 7 make it an indispensable tool,  whether you are a legal professional, an IT company, accounting firm, healthcare company or anyone else in business.This is one investment where the ROI will definitely outweigh the purchase price of the software within weeks of normal use.  The ability to go paperless and save valuable office space that is now gobbled up by filing cabinets, paper binds and closets alone should make the difference for almost any company.Testing SetupTo conduct tests of the software, the following hardware was used:PC Compatible System (2 GHz Athlon Processor, 512 MB Ram, 30 GB HD)Epson Scanner/Fax/PrinterHP LaserJet 8150DN PrinterFor software tests (conversion to PDF format), the following software was used:MS Office 2003 (Word, Excel, Outlook)Photoshop CSLoren ElksGroup Manager, D-MAG.or
This is a good inexpensive GPS system. It does a good job of tracking your location. The map is excellent. The labeling is not as good as the previous version. POI finder is top notch
Its a great GPS once its starts and detects the satellites (sometimes it can take up to 5 mins). I used it with iGuidance and that software is the whole world of difference. I can actually hear what the direction are saying vs the software that came with the GPS unit (robotic sounds, need to subtitle that for me PLEASE!)
I used this program on a 5-state road trip of the Midwest, and while overall it was  "adequate," it had some key shortcomings.The bad stuff:First, this is not an especially user-friendly program; there is a steep learning curve to operate it with ease and predictability. Spend a LOT of time playing with this BEFORE using it as a primary navigator! A lot of the commands are not intuitive, and you need to go through a lot of menus to figure things out. This can be a problem when you are on the road looking to get somewhere. It doesn't have a lot of clickable buttons on the main screen. For example, to get the program to TALK to you, you must be on a certain tab at the bottom of the screen. If you are on any other of the many tabs, the program doesn't talk to you or show you the turns. It took me HOURS to figure this out! The help function was useless.Second, the tracking can be very slow, and as a result you can easily overshoot your turns--especially when there are no physical street signs in many areas of the country--which happened to me numerous times. Many times the screen showed me I had a lot farther to go before the scheduled turn, and this caused me to overshoot it when there was no sign.Third, the "rerouting" function is AWFUL and perhaps the biggest problem with this program: if you stray from the route--even to pull off and get gas--the program flips out and keeps trying to route you back to the original route even if that route is not the easiest or most direct. I have not found a way for it to manually or automatically calculate a new and different route. I also have found no way to modify a route once you begin the route (see below).Several times in several different cities, the re-routing function was totally wrong--spitting out names of streets that weren't even on the screen at close zoom level. This is a really annoying glitch, and it happened without fail every time I strayed from the route. Once off route, there is no way to hush the program from yelling at you that you're off route, and there is also no way to easily have the program recalculate a CHANGE in the route. When there is construction that you didn't anticipate, for example, this program sucks at being able to change the route once you've started on it. Very annoying. There is no construction updater plug-in, which would be helpful for long term construction projects that go on forever. Fourth, the program does NOT audibly warn you if you are going the wrong way on a one way street. This actually happened to me, as there were no "one way" signs on a particular street in Springfield, IL. Though there were green arrows on the screen to indicate one-way, but the voice commands didn't warn me that I actually WAS going the wrong way, so had I not been looking at the screen, I wouldn't have known. You can't always look at the screen when driving. And in Iowa on I35, construction brought northbound drivers over to the southbound lanes. I was heading north in the southbound lanes (as I was supposed to) but there was no visual or audible indication that I was going the wrong way! Big time safety issue here.Fifth, the search function is wholly lacking and is not easy to use. I needed to find a police station while in Missouri--no such luck. I also needed to find the state fairgrounds in Missouri (which I later came across on the screen) but it did not show up when I intentionally searched for it. Search limitations are the second biggest problem with this program.Sixth, several times the screen showed me "off route" in a totally blacked-out area with no roads around me when I was in fact on a U.S. highway or interstate. Something wasn't communicating correctly. Other times the screen showed me more than 1000 feet off the highway even though I was certainly on the highway. In Illinois, the screen showed I was pretty much driving through corn fields even though I was on a U.S. Route. This problem is pronounced on multi-lane highways. If you're not in the center lane, often the program indicates you're off route. Very annoying.Seventh, the zoom level does not stay constant; it fluctuates automatically between high zoom and far-out zoom. I wanted high zoom most of the time to see all the minor roads and landmark indicators, but the program kept zooming out and in every few minutes.Eighth, the help function is a joke. It is totally lacking in substantive information. The program should come with a separate DVD movie showing how to use it.Ninth, the program does not recognize a lot of road name synonyms. For example, some U.S. Routes also have county/state/local designation numbers and/or an alphabetic name, but the map often only listed one or two of the many "also known as" names/numbers. This can be quite problematic when the signs on the roads don't match up with the turn commands (e.g. "Turn left on U.S. route 40," when the only street signs showed an alphabetic name and no numbers. This was also quite annoying.Tenth, the antenna that comes with the program SUCKS. Without fail, I would get a red "no signal" indicator in every city I was in where there were high-rise buildings. This happened in Kansas City, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Springfield. If you are in a city, you risk having no GPS tracking ability. And yes, my antenna was mounted as recommended. At one point I held it up through my open sun roof with no success.Eleventh, the main-screen buttons are way too small for use while driving if the laptop is on your passenger's seat. You pretty much have to pull over OR risk crashing to see what you're clicking on. Yes, I'm aware that the disclaimer for the program states you should have a separate navigator to operate the program while driving. I'm also aware that almost no one who uses this program actually has a navigator/operator.Twelfth, trip planning is lacking. When you input a starting and ending point, the program gives you ONE route. There is no way to easily plan alternate routes or to preview them. True, you can do things like program it not to take you on toll roads, but this function is not easy to use. Several times the program kept me off the interstates when I wanted to be on them, and sometimes it kept my on the interstates when I wanted to be on U.S. or smaller county roads (for sightseeing purposes). I would have to go off route and listen to the program whine about being off route.Thirteenth, I emailed a list of my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations to the folks at Delorme. Never heard back from them, which does concern me as a quality issue.Ok, so there were some redeeming qualities:First, *in general* the GPS tracker was on-target. For about 95% of my 2000-mile trip, I knew where I was and the program operated just fine. Just realize that this program (as well as GPS in general) has a lot of limitations, ESPECIALLY when there is bad weather or you are in a woodsy area or place with a lot of obstructions.Third, you can easily add points of interest and comments yourself. I used this function a lot to mark places where I want to return to take photos in daylight.Fourth, there is a selectable function to show high contrast colors (black background with bright road colors). This is quite helpful.In summation, for the money this program is a good deal, but do NOT rely on it (or any GPS program) as your *sole* source of road information/navigation. If I hadn't had my Rand McNally paper road atlas and back-up state and city maps I borrowed from the library, I would have been in big trouble several times.There are a LOT of ways this program can and should be improved, but in the meantime I'd still recommend it despite the problems. Knowing the limitations that I've listen can save you time and frustration. There is no better alternative IMHO for the price. It's possible that some of my complaints DO have fixes, but you wouldn't know it from the crappy help function.
This is my first experience with GPS.  This product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions.  Viewing the screen on a Laptop as opposed to most of the Portable GPS units is a definite advantage to the user.  I would purchase another immediately if the need arose. . 
It does everything I hoped for and more!! As a new user of Acrobate, I am very definitely impressed... in part by the ease with which I am able to learn the program, as well as its functionality!
I bought this CD for my two grandchildren for Christmas. They have all the other Nancy Drew CD's that are out and really enjoy playing them. They are a good interactive game to challenge their minds. I am sure this one will too
This new Nancy Drew game was fun to play! It was shipped on time and arrived in good condition.
It took so long for this to come out...I hated the little hints they gave us hardcore NDers on the Dare to Play message board. I had extremely high hopes for this game--I adored Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon and waited AGES for this game.Now, besides the absurd level of difficulty in this game [it was seemingly VERY hard in my eyes--I could not make it the first time through without the assistance of a walkthrough], I LOVED it. The flight to Paris and the travel about the city--it was also a LOT easier to make money in this game than in Secret of the Old Clock.I did not like how hard the puzzles were, but all in all it was an amazing game. There was a lot of talking, and that can really slow down gameplay and frustrate a gamer. And puzzles like the darkroom, the paintbomb and the cookies were absurdly difficult. But otherwise it was worth it
These are a favorite in the home. Even though we have all of them, they   are each different and provide hours of entertainment. Skills are learned while solving puzzles some include spatial manipulation of puzzle pieces and roman numerals. Great source of fun and learning. Also a desire to read the actual book and see what is different and the same between book and game
I really enjoy the Nancy Drew games. They can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a Junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done. The check list continues to update as you move through the game. I look forward to each new game as it comes out and can't leave the computer until they are done
Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.
I have read several reviews and decided the Spyder2Pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me.   I have a Samsung 970P monitor with all adjustments via software.   The calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process.I like the Spyder2Pro and would recommend it highly.
I am very happy with it but it doesn't live up to my expectations.I also have the reg. Plus for XP and I really don't think the extra money is worth it.  If I were to do over I would still have bought the Plus superpack for XP but not the regular Plus just because I do have a Media Center PC. If I didn't have that the regular Plus for XP would have been just fine
The product has very good themes and screen savers. Some the other functions are not useful to me but hopefully I will use them in the future
Product came in a timely manner and I love it. Easy to use and fun too.
extremely helpful and superior graphics and choices to change your computers them
This is an easy product to use.  It saves you when a disk drive fills up and you want to use the same partiction but need more space.  It will grab it from another hard drive.  It is also useful in setting up a D: drive for Documents, and and E: drive for programs.  It is useful to have windows on C: alone.  There are fewer crashes.Michael Common
It's a useful tool. Combined with another Norton's products GHOST, you can easily perform PC maintanence using these tools
It has some nice upgrades from version 6.  It is quicker than the previous version. Highlighting text is a bit easier.   It caused a few problems with my officejet 5510xi and its ports, but I found a patch for the officejet and all is well.  It is a product that is helpful in my work
The new Adobe Acrobat has a cleaner look and feel, and is more user-friendly.  I especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any Microsoft application, which allow you to create a PDF in one click rather than having to go to File and Print. Some functionality as before, with some new organization and better look/feel
After using 7.0 for a few weeks I find that this is the best yet. The speed of opening attachments and the compression when making them is fabulous.  I highly recommend anyone to upgrade to 7.0
Version 7 installed without a hitch and has increased the productivity of my business because it also works much better than Version 5
I upgraded from Version 5. I don't use very many of the features. But the big difference I see is, files sizes seem to be greatly reduced. Something I would scan and be 10mb, now might be 2mb. This is just opinion, nothing scientific. The interface takes some getting used to, a bit different. Overall for the price ($99 - Less $20 Rebate), a great deal
I find that the new version 7 of Adobe Acrobat loads faster than version 5, both stand-alone and within my internet browser.  Also, the new version is better integrated with the browser and with Microsoft Office.  I believe Adobe heard and responded to the complaints about version 6.  There are many other features which I have yet to try but certainly look worthwhile.  Kudos for what I see as a substantial improvement.  I recommend
I have tried a few other photo editing products but I always come back to Adobe.  Easy to use and excellent results
The software does a lot of great things.  You can start basic and work your way up to the more difficult tasks.  The system does run a bit slow and takes a long time to shut off but other than that, it is great software
I started with Elements 3 and thought it worked great. I have Elements 4 and can see it got better. 
﻿Sandra; hope you get to read this before giving up on this great little program.Check your printer drivers and spooler.  I'm as close to a computer guru as you'd want havingplayed with computers in general and PC's in particular since the heady early days of Sinclair,Kildall, and Adam Osborne.  Installed Hallmark Card Studio on my beloved's machine severalyears back.  Was immediately impressed with how thoughtfully programed for the beginner - mylady took to it immediately - and yet how full featured it was for an advanced user (only wishcould import export data to other address books, and wouldn't it be great to have a Palmconduit?!-)(I digress!-).Every new version just gets better to the point 2004 has close to two gigs of cards and imagery.In short, Sandra Hallmark Card Studio 2004 IS A KEEPER.Now, approve of your using 98SE, I recommend to my students (yes I teach computing) not to gobeyond 98SE and certainly not to connect anything from MS to the InterNet beyond 98SE (littlething code name of Palladium!-(There can be problems with corrupting printer drivers and notably spool32.  Try removing yourprinter under START >SETTINGS >PRINTERS, restart your computer with the printer on andreinstall.  Hope this helps and you learn to enjoy this little gem of a program.  HB
This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes! There are also quite a few additional projects included. You can create your own stationary sets (paper and envelopes), awards and certificates, kid's activity pages and more.I highly recommend this program if you're a beginner card maker. I mostly bought this (I was a beginner) to save money on cards and in the 2 months I've had this program, it has more than paid for itself. It's much more convenient than going to the store, WAY cheaper and I really like being able to make matching envelopes.
I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.  I wish they had included Frontpage instead of One Note (which I really haven't been able to find a use for).  Otherwise, it works the same as other MS Office packages I've used in the past
Works fine.  Like several other office packages lacks database program, Access
My daughter likes it because it uses the same format her high school teachers use.  Also, she likes the research tools that it provides.  And, it's easy to use.  It's very practical--she uses it a lot
This program does what it says.  It does limit you to only 3 loadings of the product on your computer, so if you have more than 3 computers you have to buy another program
MS Office Student and Teacher Edition 2003 is a versatile tool you can use for different purposes:  office documents and presentations, school work and projects, correspondences, scrapbooks, pictures, etc.Truly a great addition to your computer software
I bought this for my 3 children who are already taking computer classes in middle school.  The license allows you to install it on 3 computers so for $130 its a great deal considering that a single license of a full version of office is couple hundred
I have been running Windows XP SP2 and would "never" want to go back to Windows ME or Windows 98. With the XP, I rarely need to re-boot my system, and my PC no longer freezes up. There is a built-in Windows Firewall plus a pop-up blocker which are both awesome. The system is much safer, and I have NEVER had a virus, worm, or trojan horse while running the Windows XP Home with a good internet security/virus program.One thing: Make sure you have at least 256 mb of space available in your PC before starting to download, as this does require at least that.Get it! You won't be disappointed
Absolutely the easiest upgrade of a Microsoft OS that I've ever done,  as a retired hardware engineer, I've done a lot in the past. It's one sweet OS
Worked as expected. A few hardware glitches but that was to be expected
I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons.An increasing amount of Linux and Mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs, and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks.In Response to Linux Users-Stay away from Linux, Linux is free for a reason. It is compatible with very very few programs as it is, and that number will only decrease. For Gamers - Rarley do i see a Linux compatible game. Just stay away from this system.For Mac Users-Mac's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs. Fewer and Fewer programs can run on them, and like linux, that number will only decrease. The only thing keeping Macintosh alive is Itunes. Which is compatible with Windows. Besides, When Direct X 10 Comes out, it will only be available for Windows, making Macintosh's un-usable for new games when the next windows OS comes out (Microsoft Vista). The computers are also generally more expensive than Windows.  Btw - You can get viruses on Mac's
I have been running XP for a few days and so far so good. I was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98. My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.Installation went smooth as silk and I have not experienced any problems at all. I had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that's been it. And for Home Edition versus Pro, I think I can be quite happy with the Home Edition.I will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that I see so far with XP Home is a relief.Good features, good reliability. A very decent upgrade. I recommend it. Four stars
This was used to upgrade my operating system at work.  It went fairly well.  Actually much better than I had hoped
Simple. It loads like a blaze. Sure all the new frills and features like easy annotations are neat, but the speed of 7.0 alone makes it worth every dime. Especially if your current Acrobat is the half-baked clunky 6.0.x that burst through the gates before it had legs.
Honestly, I don't know how much more they can improve Adobe Acrobat.  It is an excellent product, and a god-send for electronic file management.I upgraded from version 6.0.  The only problem I had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow.This new version seems much brisker.  It loads quickly, and files seem to "print" to it much more quickly than version 6.0.  I do not utilize the "one-button" feature it provides in MS Office and other programs.  I try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible, because my previous experiences showed that they really, really bog each other down, no matter how much their makers claim they won't.I don't come close to using all the features of Acrobat, but for my needs, it far surpasses anything else I've tried (or researched).If you're having problems with version 6.0, or have an older version that you just want upgraded, I strongly recommend this.  However, I don't foresee ever needing to upgrade Acrobat again
I have been using v.7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it. It loads very fast (unlike all other adobe versions), the conversion to PDF from doc or ppt files also is much quicker. I have not encountered any problems yet, but its only been 7 days since i am using it..Definitely worth the upgrade
Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice
First, if you're thinking about using these photos for print, you may wish to think again.  Most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height, or 1-2 inches at 300 DPI.  Stretch them bigger than that, and they'll start to blur and/or get jagged.Also note, that if you try to export/save an image from the Hemera Image browser and select the 300 DPI setting, the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it's actual size, causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate.You need to use the "Use Image's Full Size" checkbox when exporting images.  If you specify a 300 DPI size, and don't use that checkbox, you'll get a stretched image.  For example, the first image in the collection (the pocket watch) is only 384 pixels wide. If you specify 300 DPI and don't check the "Use Image's Full Size" box, the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide.  The stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project.All that said, if you're going to use the images for the web, they're great.You get almost all the images you'd find in their three "Photo Objects" collections, each of which is much more expensive than this single collection.  The difference is the Photo Objects collections offer about 20-30% higher resolution (i.e. the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide, but is 492 pixels wide in Photo Objects) and you can save the Photo Objects images with transparent backgrounds (while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background).For the price, this is a good collection.  There are lots of shots with minor variations, so it may seem like duplication, but for someone trying to get something just right, that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered
Some other people have complain about the quality, if you're a print graphic artist then its problem.  As a web designer who need 2" by 2" graphics, this set is great.  You do get a variety of photos of objects.  For example, there's like 20 different examples of a live garnade, something like several hundred coins from different countries.  For $17 this is definitely worth the money.I've found it is best to export the image to a graphic editor.  Then from there, make it transparent, resize it, and compress it to your wishes.  There's a fair amount of "People" graphic, but not as much as I'd like.  I don't have the 100K collection so don't know if there's any image overlapse between this and that collection.Quality is pretty nice for small prints and great for web.  Especially superb for smaller projects like christmas cards and so forth, but not good if you want to print high resolution photographs on large paper.For $17 this is the best collection I've ever bought, Photo Objects II is still in shipping, so can't compare quality with that collection yet. 
OneCare is not a tweaker's friend. It has no knobs and gizmos for power users to tinker with. However, it does one thing right. It works. When you use it, you truly do have one care. Do what it tells you to make it green. If you can do that, your computer is safe from viruses, hackers, malware, spyware, known security vulnerabilities, low disk space, slow disk access, and data that is not backed up.OneCare takes a layered approach to keep you and your data safe. It has an inbound firewall to keep bad stuff out of your computer. If bad stuff gets through the firewall, it has antivirus to stop it from affecting your system and an outbound firewall to keep it from spreading. If that doesn't stop the bad stuff, it makes sure you have a backup of your data on a separate drive or on CDs.In the past, I haven't bought security products. There are plenty of free ones on the market that do a satisfactory job. However, ever since I tried OneCare as a beta tester, I fell in love with it. It is simple to use.Reduce your worries about being online down to OneCare and try it today. You can even install it on other computers to help keep friends and family protected
Great SW, easy to learn, and good graphics.  Really helps visualize the space when you can see it 3D. Could be improved if numerous similar objects could be selected and changed simultaneously (e.g., windows, doors, cabinets to get all with the same materials, colors,  hardware rather than one at a time - very labor intensive).  Should warn users to select/create a style and then copy/paste them where needed.Also, difficult (maybe impossible, because I haven't figured out how to do it) to change a room's/house's overall style once you start a given design
This package is very complete and easy to use.  Took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts, et.  A lot of the tools are intuitive and simple
There are complaints about Win XP SP2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems.It is too expensive, but it is the standard at so many companies, big and small, around the world.I just wanted to say that anyone who gives Windows XP SP2 a one star rating really doesn't understand much about the Windows operating system, and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general.The price is a bit high, but Windows is what it is...  a dominant operating system
I do not why the others had these problems with Windows XP. I have run this program since it came out 2001? Except for the danger of attack by viruses, I have had no trouble as long as enough RAM is installed. A minimum of 500-750 is essential. With the addition of antivirus software and service pack 2, I feel fairly secure.
I ordered the box version from Amazon, instead of the download from the manufacturer not only because it was less expensive, but the main reason was so that I would have a paper manual. So many programs don't come with hard copy manuals and I prefer them over on-line help. As for the program itself, I trialed a download first. For me, the thing I fell in love with was the ability to call up multiple images, side by side, and compare them! It makes selecting the best image a breeze - a HUGE timesaver. You also have the ability to swiftly zoom in to check focus at full rez. Another wonderful thing is that putting the curser over one of the preview images, and sliding it, will slide all the open previews simultaneously, so you don't have to individually zoom and move each image. You can do this with up to 6 images at a time! You can also do a quick histogram check by hitting the "h" key, which makes it easy to toss off bad exposures at the same time as the review. While you've got the previews open you can hover the mouse over them and hit any # key to color-code the image. The colors can be keyed to whatever description you want. I do "1=green" for yes, "2=yellow" for maybe, and "3=red" for no. There's room for quite a few more colors after that. I then hit the sort key back in the main screen and quickly select all the red "no" images and delete them. After I have all my green "yes" images, I then review them 6 at a time to give them star ratings. I resort by rating and now all the best images are at the top of the page and I can start processing them. You can batch process file name, and some other things that I don't bother with, as well. It's got some nice keywording ability and you can easily sync the keywords with your Photoshop files. What's incredibly nice is that you can click on any word in the keyword list and all the images you own, with those keywords, are immediately shown in thumbnails! Finding an image is actually fun! It will even give you thumbnails of images you don't even store on your hard drive anymore! Fantastic program - I highly recommend it! The only reason I didn't 5 star it is b/c it's not all that intuitive. This is a read-the-manual kind of program, but you can do an awful lot with it without having to get too far in the book. ;)
I downloaded the demo of this program and although I am by no means a pro photographer I do have over 4,000 digital photographs of my family and I am taking new photos each day. In addition I post my photos on Pbase so family and friends can always see the latest photos.  I started looking into Digital Asset Management after I started to fall behind on updates of the Pbase photo website because of the time consuming process of managing my collection. In case you have not looked, there are products out there such as Idimager, Imatch, Extensis Porfolio, and many more. I downloaded demos of Imatch and Iview Media Pro and used each only briefly. Although Imatch costs only $49.00 or so and Iview costs about 3x more (around $160) I chose Iview because I felt the interface was just easier to use. Of course this says nothing about the features in each product and I am not attempting a feature by feature comparison because I don't have the time. I do think that Imatch is an excellent product and the few features I am looking for appeared to be available in both products. I recommend that anyone looking to purchase software attempt to download a demo first
This is an all around awesome product. I have had great experiences with the program, and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school's yearbook. Anyone one who says it doesn't have the basics is pretty much lying to you, it has anything you'll ever need and more. The people who review this product poorly do so because they don't know how to use everything in it. The only problem I've ever had is learing everything you can do with it, otherwise it is perfect
Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great.I tested the integration between InDesign CS2 and some of its counterparts in the Adobe Creative Suite Premium.  I created different graphics in Photoshop CS2 and Illustrator CS2 and I found it was really easy to import them into InDesign CS2 and use.  You can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in InDesign CS2.  No need to go to another program.  With the Control Palette you can also resize objects too.  This palette functions with Transform and Stroke features for graphics, and it includes paragraph, character and table features for text editing.  What the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text. I imported some formatted text in from Microsoft Word 2003 and two different tables in from Microsoft Excel 2003.  I was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from Microsoft Excel.  The tables imported easily. With InDesign CS2, you can now automatically style Microsoft Word files on import by mapping Word styles to InDesign CS2 styles as well.An issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with InDesign CS2.  Now, Adobe "bridges" that gap.  Bridge now comes as a part of InDesign CS2 and the Premium Suite.  So, viewing any Adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do.  Using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well.  Adobe Bridge is a standalone program.Being a Web Designer and using Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Dreamweaver 8, I was familiar with using Snippets.  These are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else.  Now,  InDesign CS2 offers this Snippet capability.  You can export objects as snippets. These objects can be shared or reused in other documents. Simply place or drag a snippet into a layout, and  InDesign re-creates the original objects, their formatting, and their relative positioning on the page.  No more wasted time redesigning, just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit.InDesign CS2 also now has an Info palette that is just like those found in Photoshop and Illustrator.  Size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the Info palette.  This is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area.  It's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working.Sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work, you have to move objects.  When this happens, your structure can often change in different ways.  InDesign CS2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts, pull quotes, margin notes, and graphics to text. You can now precisely control the positioning of Anchored Objects, apply text wrap settings, and more.As with other Adobe products, it is very easy to export your finished work in PDF format.  InDesign CS2 works so well at exporting to PDF, it even maintains the layers in Acrobat 7.  You can pre-define your Acrobat export settings as well.  InDesign CS2 also supports specialty PDF formats like PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, which are used in workflows.  It also supports high-resolution CMYK output and color-managed workflows.If you are familiar with previous versions of InDesign, the upgrade to the new version is easy.  InDesign CS2 is even backwards compatible CS.  You will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased.Loren Elks, Group ManagerD-MAG.or
This product is so good. I love it! I can make my own MP3's, make disk copies and archive data files. I'm curious to see how DVD movies are made with this product. I'm very happy with this item. The price is very pleasing as well.
This is the easiest way I've ever been able to make CD's. It realy makes photo CD's easy and produces a great product. A group of frinds and Us just got back from Mexico and I put all of everyones photos in separate files on a CD. The automatic slide show goes through the differn't files as if they were just one file with no seperation, but the pictures are still separated in each person's file for ease when printing and so forth. It's great, wish I would have had this years ago
I have used this software from the very first as a PaintShop product and it still delivers. It has improved with this version. I reckon I have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best. For more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program. What it claims to do, it does well. If only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones. A simple histogram would make this a top ranking program
I liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times. I always shoot with Nikon RAW format. It has hung a couple of times and I had to kill it after waiting for 10-15 minutes.
The service was good and it came undamaged and the product was easy to use and it has been very satisfactory for my needs.The description of the product was accurate
Although not perfect, I've used Roxio CD/DVD 6 Platinum and Nero 6, and returned to using this product. This should also be called Burning CD's for Dummies, it is THAT easy to use. I've also used it to burn VCD's without a hitch. If all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler, this is for you
If you decide to buy a current greeting card program, there are really only two front-line choices: Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory (currently version 5) or Hallmark Card Studio (currently 2006). There are other programs available specifically for creating cards, but most of them are low quality and outdated, and aren't really worth considering. (A competitive third product featuring American Greetings designs is sadly now long outdated; the designs in the American Greetings program were of similar quality to those in the Hallmark package).So how do these two products match up? Without a question, if you are looking for quality "canned" cards, the Hallmark program wins. The Hallmark designs are professional, and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store. In contrast, the designs in Art Explosion are adequate but surely NOT up to the quality of a store-bought card. The Hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store (although you are stuck with the choices pre-programmed into the software unless you want much frustration). The Art Explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations.Art Explosion beats the Hallmark program in editing options (more extensive), and in the amount of additional art (clipart, etc.) included with the package.If you do not plan to use the "canned" cards, then I would recommend Art Explosion. But the average user will likely appreciate the professional, high quality cards in the Hallmark package. Personally, I consider the choice of the Hallmark package over Art Explosion a no brainer. A note on versions: The publisher comes out with a new version of the Hallmark program every year (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, etc.) and the same is true for Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory. Having used many of these versions, I find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year. Disappointingly, the stock cards in the Hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years, and the same is true for Art Explosion.
This program does exactly as I expect. I am very pleased
I had a very old version of Hallmark Studio, don't even remember how old.  Wanted to update.  I installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features.  Lots of cards to choose from, very very pretty colors. The event planner is great too! The ONLY thing I would change is the ability change font in the planner, and move written info by tabbing.  Otherwise it's a wonderful program.  Highly recommended!!Satisfie
I buy a lot of cards and they are always Hallmartk because I there quality is wonderful.  The kit is of the same high quality.  It also lets you personalize them with your own text and your own pictures.  It was one of the best things I ever bought and I know I well use it a lot
Purchased for my mom to use and she loves it. She says it is easy to use and she really enjoys making personalized cards for people. If she's happy with it, so am I
I am enjoying this new card shop they have refreshing great cards others do not. My friends and family that I have made cards for think they are the best also. Keep making more and more. Thank
This program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful.Installation is self explanatory. This also goes for the prepararation of cards ect.Detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse-pointer over various portions of the graphics. If you are looking for an easy to use program with great results, this is the one to get. With the cost of cards being what it is, this program will pay for itself very quickly. Relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized. I recommend this  program highly
I'm not a Spider-Man fan.  I love POWERS, THE ULTIMATES, SUPREME POWER, PLANETARY and other stuff by Warren Ellis, Brian Michael Bendis, et.al.  So when I bought this, I wondered if spending a whopping $49 would be worth it.    I wanted to read Straczynski's recent run of Spider-Man, but if I was going to spend about $20 on a graphic novel, why not spend a little more for the whole thing.  And that's just what you get.  In addition to getting Straczynski's 4-year run (which includes Spider-Man's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers), you get everything leading up to JUNE 2006 (which is just like 3 issues ago!).  And all on 1 DVD-ROM.  True, the Cons are that when it comes to Crossovers, you only get the Amazing Spider-Man stories and reading it off your computer isn't as fun as reading the actual comics -- but that doesn't compare to getting the entire run.  It's like complaining about getting a free PS3, XBox360 AND Nintendo Wii, because the box didn't come with it or you're missing one controller.  $50 may seem steep, but if comics cost $3 now, so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics -- or for 2 books, you get everything.  And it's true, you can just print out the pages if you want (so if you want to abuse your office or school's printer, go for it!
This set has got everything.  Almost every major Spider-man moment is in this collection.  From Spider-man's first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15, his wedding, and not to forget those great super-villain battles with the Green Goblin and Venom.Each issue is scanned in .pdf format.  It has all the original colors, ads, and fan mail printed.  They are all organized by year and it says they are all printable.  If you are looking for the entire Stan Lee and John Romita Sr.'s run, here it is.  It is great to see where Todd Mcfarlane, the creator of Spawn got his start on old webhead.   J. Michael Strackzynski, the writer of Babylon 5 also takes a crack at Spider-man's life.  The collection covers the beginning from Amazing Fantasy #15 to Amazing Spiderman #531, which is around the start of Marvel's Civil War.Instead of spending thousands of dollars on purchasing back issues, you can own this entire collection for around $40-$45.  If you have the ink, you can print out any issue to your heart's desire.The only drawbacks are around the 80s when several spider-man books begin to crossover.  You only get a part of the story in Kraven's Last Hunt or Maximum Carnage.  One major moment of Spider-man's life is left out, where he fights Harry Osborn as Green Goblin. The conclusion of that story took place in The Spectacular Spider-man title.  That problem is going to fixed in the future as GIT Corp. has plans to release a complementary collection  dvd that includes The Spectacular Spider-man, Web of Spiderman, and Peter Parker:  Spider-man.  They say on the boards that it will be out by fall of next year, but you never know with this company.  I waited about six months for this dvd after it was delayed from its original release date from march.Now that I have it, I cannot wait to dig into the mythos of the old webhead.  I recommend this to anyone who loves comics and loves Spider-man.Be sure to look out for the Ultimate Spider-man collection and there are a few others like the Hulk, Daredevil, Iron Man, and Captain America collections that are due out next year
I am teaching myself Japanese. I want to learn more languages. I learned German, French, and Korean. I want to learn Korean. Because I have a friend who speaks Korean. This software is very awesome!!! This can really help students who are taking French or Spanish to get a good review. If you find a language you want to learn from this software... good luck with your studies and have fun
My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels, which may or may not be necessary, I don't know. Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it

This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment
Nice collection of the complete issues, though, of course, one knows going in that the later Marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story, which is somewhat frustrating.  And the earliest years are, of course, somewhat crude (heretically, even the Kirby artwork in the first year is).But very nice to have in an affordable edition, regardless of the flaws (though best viewed with a large monitor
This is a great collection to get if you would like to read the comic's from the past at a great price.
I couldn't have found a better X-Men product. Every mag. has its own PDF. The readability is only limited by the size of your monitor
All I have to say is 485 comics for 40 dollars.  Or about 40 years worth.  That's like a dollar a year.  You do the math...it's an amazing deal.  Also, quality is great and you can print them if you want
I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like.  However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted.  This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years.  Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.  If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all. (almost)
While I love the content and the overall idea, it seems they seriously skimped on the packaging. All you get, outside of the outer box, is a cd in a paper envelope. No jewel case, book, insert, etc.......perhaps it's on the cd
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice  ignoramus than I.  Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used.  Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty.  Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9.  Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program.  I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen.  But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle.When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW!  What an overall improvement!!Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close.  With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool.  The intuitive menus are nice too.  Also cool is that all the text  paragraph and fill  stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them.  Aaaahh!  Finally some help for dunces like me.Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool.  The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted.But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on.  I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all.  The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics.  And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions.  Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience.  But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet.The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs.  In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional stuff but not for a living.  But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9.  Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone
This new version of Illustrator is great, glad I upgraded! The Live Trace feature is cool
I was waiting for CS2 after using the CS. There are too many problems in CS. And I am very happy with CS2 now. The software is a lot easier to use, less problems. I have been using illustrator since illustrator 4. CS2 is definitly better than ever!
Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good.Why ruin things with an upgrade
OK, sorry, I've been vectoring line art since 1990. My current machine is an AMD Athlon XP with the 333 FSB, 1 Gig ram  80 Gig HD shared on network  a 40 Gig HD for software, OS is XPpro, it's 2 years old I think. I installed three cathode ray tubes, you know; big boxy monitors, the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day. I read the reviews here and started "Quaking" in my boots! Oops I said to myself, and I looked up my previous day's purchases for the new Artist I just hired. Sure enough; I bought CS2 for the new machine. So I downloaded the 30 day trial for Illustrator CS2 Upyours, I mean Upgrade. Replacing my old Illustrator 8.01 These kids I've been interviewing made me think I should take a look outside MY CAVE! So I got it loaded up and sure enough; it takes longer to load than my old corrupted rusty buddy; Illustrator 8.01, about twice as long. ( so leave it running )!!!!!!!!! BUT WOW !!!!!!!I should have done this sooner, or should I have ?As soon as It was running Illustrator CS2 AUTO UPDATED ITSELF.It wanted it's Adobe Bridge fixed up. So I let it. This is just exactly what people have been complaining about.******** THE BRIDGE IS FIXED *********WAY SUPER COOL DUDE! I keep the Bridge open on the right monitor and I can drag art into Illustrator CS2 at lightning speed. The whole time I get to see super big previews of all the artwork I need to work with. Way better than XPpro's little thumbnails.LIVE TRACE: Realy nice, I think this is what these companies are using to sell Vectored Line Art to Printers like me. It is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now, took a human brain to see past while vectoring. OK, it's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as (full of) myself, but for only about $160 or so, it's like a gift from ALMIGHTY GOD!No crashes, no bugs, just pure inteligence from Adobe once again.Don't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say ADOBE?I really apreciate the Object Oriented work bar thing at the top, wait, let me go look at what it's called, Hmmmm, still don't know, well it changes according to what kind of object you've clicked on in your artwork. Also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work. That top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in Photoshop.Transparent objects, looks like everything can be transparent, WOW, do you know what that means ??? I gotta go use it some more, it's just way to cool. OK, I'm back, EVEN FONTS can be transparent, .tiffs .jpgs, everything. THIS MEANS way less jumping back and forth from Photoshop to Illustrator.But I do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware, operating system, and have at least a year; full time with Illustrator and Photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that Adobe has opened up for us
As one who is not an accountant, I found Quickbooks Premier Non-Profit Edition 2006 to be very easy to learn. Read the books that come with the software before you dive in
Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product.To accomplish the reports that I need, I am able to edit the Gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose.  So, it gets the report done, just not as nicely as I had hoped.Tracking work is made incredibly simple.  Rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software
I decided to get this office suite after using it recently. I've usually worked on Office 97 and 2000, but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions. The feature that I really enjoy is the Pivot Report feature in MS Access, which wasn't in MS Access 2000. This is a truly great reporting feature. You can now use Access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase and other enterprise-type databases. If you're used to creating crosstab reports, you'll definitely like the Pivot Report feature. Crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there's no limitation on the number of dimensions in Pivot Report.To me, the main drawback is the price. (I did get mine at around $370 at J, which is a great price.) I figure I can upgrade this in about 5 years time, which works out to about $70 to $75 per year (assuming that I'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time.)A big positive is that this is the industry standard. So the work you put into learning the multiple new features of Word, Excel, MS Access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job. Your time will be well spent. Note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful. Different features are useful to different people...Another positive: Each product in Office Professional is fully programmable using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which you can use to build custom programs. This very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for Office suites. 
You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it. I'm not going to criticize anyone except to say IF you have a question or problem, the ZA website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company's products. There are some compatibility probs for example with Yahoo Mail BETA. As soon as Yahoo finalizes it's mail server ZA will be compatible. Simply switch back to yahoo mail (pre beta). There are several other beta products but generally if you're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs. ZA REALLY is better at what it is suppose to do than other products ONCE you have learned how to use it. Kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar. I use the free stuff too, and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students, etc. but the ZA suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who can't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway. I know what you're thinking btw...but ask yourself "Is your private information, time  and computer worth it to you?" If so go with Zone Alarm, learn how to use it and be safer on the net.John Rowin1ea
As you can see by other reviews above, the Studio series has a history of being buggy.  You also hear a lot of people saying "This package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other 'powerful enough to be worth owning' packages -- if only it were more stable!"  I am one of those long-suffering users (5 years, going back to Version 9), and finally with Version 10.6 I have stopped complaining -- it now works as I'd hoped when I bought it.  The $300 I spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted -- I kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual couldn't clarify.  And I'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures.I am turning all of our old family video tapes and CD's into DVD's.  I use Studio for all the editing (have not tried the DVD recording -- just use Roxio for that) and am now very pleased.  If you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download.One important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems: put every "project" you work on in a separate subdirectory.  If you have 5 soccer game videos make a /game1, /game2 etc. series of subfolders.  If you edit those to a "Jimmy's great plays" proect, put it in a separate /JimmyPlays folder.  When projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5.  I learned this trick before 10.6 came out, and I don't know if it matters any more but I take no chances.Why did I stick with something where I admit that version 9.0 was "powerful but unstable" and 10.0 was "more powerful and more unstable"?  Because I can actually use Studio with minimal reference to instructions, and when I use it things turn out as I expect.  Now that it has become stable and reliable I am a VERY satisfied customer.So that's how I got from being a frustrated Studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review.  I tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions, but that "10.5 updated for free to 10.6" really is the best choice out there now... as my unused expensive rivals to Studio on my shelf prove.  Just keep putting every project inn its own folder!
I've been using Studio for years and while I definitely had reliability problems with Studio 10.0, 10.6 has been very reliable, and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better.  I tried Premiere Elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things, and it was much slower burning a simple DVD image, and it simply doesn't do HD which I've started playing with.  I'm sticking with Studio and I make a DVD just about every week with my kids' videos.  I do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean
I have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product. I have created numerous videos of my children's escapades and sporting events. I do have one warning however. Provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen. The software is extremely intuitive and easy to use. My wildest expectations were exceeded.
This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack.However, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with "Colloquial Icelandic" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- "Hva" is pronounced "kwah?" WHAT? Having "Colluquial Icelandic" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook.I gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course
I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features.  A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro.  Installation was a snap.  Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection.  The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop.  I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools.  (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them.  However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks.  I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results.  I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software.
I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP.  It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user.
This is a great productbecause once you install itYou need not use the cd agai
It is wondeful software.  Simple, easy to use, user-friendly, and very accurate in the pronunciation.Buy this CD.  Don't waste your money on the subscription at merriam-webster's website.ALso try the Medical dictionary.  It is as equally superb
i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .
I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website
Having trouble figuring out how to make a corner cabinet for sinks. Any help will be appreciated.  Kroh
I am not a "computer person" but found this to be easy, easy, easy
Excellent product for backup with the intelligence built into it. Highly recommended
I loved the experience, especially with the smart picks, smart templates, smart search, and smart rank.  I recommend it to any user.  Very happy with the product!  Thanks Eisenworld, Thanks Alohabob
I am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side.  This purchase has paid for itself over and over now that I don't have to run to someone else for art.  It was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images...  I guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images...  I did and I LOVE this product!!!!
Good for those looking for a vector collection.  Not so good for those looking for photo clip art, as photos are "high-res" at 200 DPI.  I suppose the photos are useful to an extent, but the usefulness is limited by size.  I was looking for vector art, so I am satisfied
  My experience with this software as well as the company has been extremely positive. I ordered this program a little over a month ago. When I first received it from Amazon, I was amazed at the shear size of the program. It has a HUGE 1,300 page book with all the images and categories for easy reference. It also comes with 34 CDs that are loaded with images. This software is truly the largest set of art I have ever seen!  Dealing with Nova Development is as easy to use as their software! When I first opened the box I was a little overwhelmed with the whole thing, so I called tech support. I may have waited a whole 20 seconds before I began speaking with a technician. They walked me through the install and how to use the clip art. They were professional and courteous.  This software gets an A+ in my book!.    
I've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and I finally broke down and bought it.  Very pleased with everything included.  LOTS of stuff to use, and not just cheezy clip art - lots of boarders, symbols, brush strokes, etc.  The bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc (disc 3 was actually disc 30) - one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked. 
I run the after school program at the local JR high where i work. We try to push the importance of computer skills on the children. I just upgraded to the 800,000 clip art library. We use these images for just about every project. I have never wanted a certain type of image and not been able to find it!!!
Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie.One of the things I like best about Homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in ASP.NET. I was able to find a plug-in, which when added to Homesite, recognized the .NET tags and colors them accordingly. There are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there.If you are unfamiliar with HomeSite, are considering a purchase, but are not sure it's the right tool for you, here's a very brief description on how it works: This is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you. It is, in essence, a text editor on steroids. As you code BY HAND it will color the code for you, tell you when you've made errors, offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean, has a built in FTP client, helps you organize your work into projects, and a bunch of other functions I've never used.Here's the main thing you need to know: If you're a HomeSite pro, then you are also a REAL developer.To everyone who has whined about lack of support: What do you expect for less then $100? If you purchase a flagship product from Macromedia such as Dreamweaver, Studio MX, or Fireworks, you'll get all the support you'll need.Also, I've been able to find PLENTY of FREE support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development. For every problem or question I've found someone who knows the solution. You can too!!!Just a note: Amazon is behind the times. From the Macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what Amazon is offering.Well worth the $99.00
...and I knew it wouldn't be the last. Very very fun. Don't think Nancy Drew is just for girls, guys can play and love the game as well. I am living proof of that.The game itself really isn't that hard, it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky (I don't like puzzles) and that is the only 'beef' I have with the game, and most mystery games. Now, back to the game itself.. intriguing storyline, suspicous characters and they all got something to hide. Search for clues while interrogating suspects.. explore the resort, run errands, break into locked rooms without getting caught, disable alarms, and SNOOP.. and that is just the tip of the iceburg.If  you like mystery games, Nancy Drew is for you! Her games aren't overly hard, and they are very fun. Even if you aren't a mystery fan, try it! You'll love it. Try them all! You will become a Nancy Drew fan, trust me.. I did
This was a wonderful game!  Hours of good, solid game play.  An interesting mystery and intriguing characters.  A chance to interact with aquatic life.  I learned how to work a GPS and a HAM radio.  It was so much fun.  The puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types.  Word puzzles, spatial puzzles, problem-solving ones.  I can completely recommend this game
I had a LOT of fun playing this game and look foward to playing more Nancy Drew products.  It was interesting and I couldn't WAIT to solve the mystery!  I enjoyed myself a lot! 
A good choice for newbies that love adventure games.  Nancy Drew's games are perfect, fresh, relaxing, but also give you a lot of thinking some times
I am very happy with it but it doesn't live up to my expectations.I also have the reg. Plus for XP and I really don't think the extra money is worth it.  If I were to do over I would still have bought the Plus superpack for XP but not the regular Plus just because I do have a Media Center PC. If I didn't have that the regular Plus for XP would have been just fine
The product has very good themes and screen savers. Some the other functions are not useful to me but hopefully I will use them in the future
Product came in a timely manner and I love it. Easy to use and fun too.
Not a complicated application, but it successfully repartitioned a 100G drive into 3rds on a new Lenovo laptop with XP SP2.  I would recommend using the DOS version which you can get just by booting on the CD.  Requires no install, you can simply boot, make the changes, and it is done.  Seems to be very straightforward and I would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with Windows running
I installed a WD 320G usb drive to use as a backup drive. I used the HD backup software to do auto backups. Unfortunatly the software took controll of the entire drive and I could not use it as you would a normal drive (Drag n drop)or access a particular file.   I used Partition Magic to reclaim my USB drive and in the process I partitioned the drive. The drive now works as I want it to I have control!Partition Magic was very easy to use and didi a perfect job.
I am amazed what this program can do. It is a big difference from PS 5.5. It is a new learning curve but well worth it. What used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes. Amazon had the best price for me from a source I trust ordering from. It is worth it
Photoshop is incredibly awesome!!!  And in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program, it is a must have for them. However the learning curve here is extremely steep.  This program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale.  There are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including Photoshop elements.  
I won't include my website URL here, but I'm a professional photographer, who displays and sells his work at juried exhibitions. I've been using Photoshop since version 5.0, roughly 6-7 years.Frankly, I'm surprised to see how many negative reviews there are here of Photoshop CS2, and that overall the product only gets three stars. I understand all the frustration, though. Even on a top-of-the-line machine, "PS CS2" can be slow at times. However, in my case, that's because I'm working on incredibly large files. For example, my camera / scanner combination typically produces 50 megapixel images. By the time multiple layers are added in PS, one image file can be 500 MB - 1 GB in size. This is exactly why I have a dual-Opteron system with 4 GB of RAM: so I can work on these monster files in Photoshop!For me, Photoshop is a must-have. There are *no* alternative programs for me to consider that can handle my files and do what I want to get done. I don't even want to mention all the advanced features that I use on a daily basis, frankly because that's part of my edge as a professional. I've spent over five years working in PS everyday, and have carefully studied several advanced books on PS. The learning curve is long, but the rewards are great if you have high goals and high standards.Yeah, Adobe's got some major improvements to make, along the lines that other reviewers have mentioned. For me, the only real problem is poor and often wasteful use of system memory. And I would agree with other reviewers here that for most people, the full Photoshop CS2 is probably a waste of money. Photoshop Elements is probably a better way to go, though I haven't used it personally. I know a good web designer who uses Paint Shop Pro, and who seems to be happy.IMHO, some people are probably drawn to Photoshop the way others are drawn to AutoCad or Solidworks or 3D Studio Max. All these programs are incredibly powerful tools that can support an entire career if one puts in the time and effort to become a true expert user. You can't make a career out of PS Elements, or Paint Shop Pro, or GIMP, or whatever else other reviewers may mention. PS CS2 is "the standard" for image manipulation
I still have a LOT of learning to do, but just what I've been able to do with photos the last 2 weeks is amazing.  I don't know why I waited so long to buy this thing
Adobe Photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business.  It's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user.  There is, however, a plethora of texts, tutorials, learning guides, and even video's to help abate the learning curve
I have Fireworks, Corel Paint, and now CS2 to choose from. Perhaps it's my familiarity with PhotoShop that makes me so partial to it, but I feel it's the best imagery software on the market. I upgraded to this from PS7, so I missed out on CS, but from what I can tell, this is the smoothest-running version yet. I've not encountered any problems with system or support... I guess everyone's experience is different. But this is great software, and the Vanishing Point feature is just brilliant
The new Adobe Acrobat has a cleaner look and feel, and is more user-friendly.  I especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any Microsoft application, which allow you to create a PDF in one click rather than having to go to File and Print. Some functionality as before, with some new organization and better look/feel
After using 7.0 for a few weeks I find that this is the best yet. The speed of opening attachments and the compression when making them is fabulous.  I highly recommend anyone to upgrade to 7.0
I love this Adobe product.  It works very well for me - only a couple of minor glitches - it keeps asking me to re-register - but that's only a minor annoyance.  Overall it is a very good product
Version 7 installed without a hitch and has increased the productivity of my business because it also works much better than Version 5
The software does a lot of great things.  You can start basic and work your way up to the more difficult tasks.  The system does run a bit slow and takes a long time to shut off but other than that, it is great software
I started with Elements 3 and thought it worked great. I have Elements 4 and can see it got better. 
Even if one could afford the full PhotoShop CS or CS2, Elements has it all for the photo enthusiast.  Elements has an uncluttered interface with two choices for photo manipulation;Quick Fix and Standard Edit. The Browser is adequate though I've used simpler ones for organizing and finding photos. Many of the features of the full program can be found in Elements like Layers, plug-ins for effects, and a variety of adjustmens.  With a little patience and experimenting, as well as magazines that include video tutorials for specific needs you'll be surprised how creative you can be. This program does not have the learning curve of the full PhotoShop software yet is more than powerful enough for the creative amateur photographer
with plenty of opportunity to be creative.  The only downfall is that there is no way to download more cards from the internet.All in all though, I would highly recommend this software
Help!  This program will not let me print all of my address's unto christmas labels.  When you go down to the arrow to check all address's it will not move.  Any Help would be appreciated.Thank
This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes! There are also quite a few additional projects included. You can create your own stationary sets (paper and envelopes), awards and certificates, kid's activity pages and more.I highly recommend this program if you're a beginner card maker. I mostly bought this (I was a beginner) to save money on cards and in the 2 months I've had this program, it has more than paid for itself. It's much more convenient than going to the store, WAY cheaper and I really like being able to make matching envelopes.
I was really surprised to read some of the other reviews about this product -- it's as we we've purchased entirely different programs. In my experience with this software, I've found it to be extremely smooth-running and user-friendly from installation to printing, and the card selection and customization is second to none. There have been perfect cards for every occasion to date and we've customized them countless ways -- adding and editing photos, moving text, sending ecards, you name it! Navigating within the art studio is very intuitive.Printing cards from the sofware is very easy and the on-screen configuration works great. Unlike some of the other reviews, I haven't had the problem of having to re-configure every time I print. We set it up once and that was it. I've printed on card stock paper, which turns out gorgeous, and we've also printed the quarter-fold plain letter size which also looks great and works perfect with size A2 envelopes (this is a great printing option if you don't want to buy card stock paper!).I've used this software on all of my computers, have recommended it to many people, and so far have not yet encountered or heard of any problems. I highly recommend it. It's a fun program, the recipients will love their customized cards, and it will save you money in the long run
This suite of applications is excellent.They run much faster on my Mac than even the equivalent Mac programs.I love them and use them quite happily every single day. A great value for students and teachers
I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.  I wish they had included Frontpage instead of One Note (which I really haven't been able to find a use for).  Otherwise, it works the same as other MS Office packages I've used in the past
Works fine.  Like several other office packages lacks database program, Access
Love this product.  I like having these Microsoft programs without paying the price for the full versios
This program does what it says.  It does limit you to only 3 loadings of the product on your computer, so if you have more than 3 computers you have to buy another program
MS Office Student and Teacher Edition 2003 is a versatile tool you can use for different purposes:  office documents and presentations, school work and projects, correspondences, scrapbooks, pictures, etc.Truly a great addition to your computer software
Absolutely the easiest upgrade of a Microsoft OS that I've ever done,  as a retired hardware engineer, I've done a lot in the past. It's one sweet OS
I followed all instructions before I attempted to do an upgrade from Windows Me to Windows XP - infact, the more I read the more I was told to do a clean upgrade.  So, I did a backup and removed programs that were not compatible and I got some instructions off the internet on how to do it and it went very smooth. I love what it gave me. Clean upgrade means a clean start - you remove everything and start with a new program
I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons.An increasing amount of Linux and Mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs, and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks.In Response to Linux Users-Stay away from Linux, Linux is free for a reason. It is compatible with very very few programs as it is, and that number will only decrease. For Gamers - Rarley do i see a Linux compatible game. Just stay away from this system.For Mac Users-Mac's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs. Fewer and Fewer programs can run on them, and like linux, that number will only decrease. The only thing keeping Macintosh alive is Itunes. Which is compatible with Windows. Besides, When Direct X 10 Comes out, it will only be available for Windows, making Macintosh's un-usable for new games when the next windows OS comes out (Microsoft Vista). The computers are also generally more expensive than Windows.  Btw - You can get viruses on Mac's
I have been running XP for a few days and so far so good. I was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98. My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.Installation went smooth as silk and I have not experienced any problems at all. I had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that's been it. And for Home Edition versus Pro, I think I can be quite happy with the Home Edition.I will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that I see so far with XP Home is a relief.Good features, good reliability. A very decent upgrade. I recommend it. Four stars
This was used to upgrade my operating system at work.  It went fairly well.  Actually much better than I had hoped
Honestly, I don't know how much more they can improve Adobe Acrobat.  It is an excellent product, and a god-send for electronic file management.I upgraded from version 6.0.  The only problem I had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow.This new version seems much brisker.  It loads quickly, and files seem to "print" to it much more quickly than version 6.0.  I do not utilize the "one-button" feature it provides in MS Office and other programs.  I try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible, because my previous experiences showed that they really, really bog each other down, no matter how much their makers claim they won't.I don't come close to using all the features of Acrobat, but for my needs, it far surpasses anything else I've tried (or researched).If you're having problems with version 6.0, or have an older version that you just want upgraded, I strongly recommend this.  However, I don't foresee ever needing to upgrade Acrobat again
I have been using v.7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it. It loads very fast (unlike all other adobe versions), the conversion to PDF from doc or ppt files also is much quicker. I have not encountered any problems yet, but its only been 7 days since i am using it..Definitely worth the upgrade
Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice
First, if you're thinking about using these photos for print, you may wish to think again.  Most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height, or 1-2 inches at 300 DPI.  Stretch them bigger than that, and they'll start to blur and/or get jagged.Also note, that if you try to export/save an image from the Hemera Image browser and select the 300 DPI setting, the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it's actual size, causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate.You need to use the "Use Image's Full Size" checkbox when exporting images.  If you specify a 300 DPI size, and don't use that checkbox, you'll get a stretched image.  For example, the first image in the collection (the pocket watch) is only 384 pixels wide. If you specify 300 DPI and don't check the "Use Image's Full Size" box, the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide.  The stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project.All that said, if you're going to use the images for the web, they're great.You get almost all the images you'd find in their three "Photo Objects" collections, each of which is much more expensive than this single collection.  The difference is the Photo Objects collections offer about 20-30% higher resolution (i.e. the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide, but is 492 pixels wide in Photo Objects) and you can save the Photo Objects images with transparent backgrounds (while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background).For the price, this is a good collection.  There are lots of shots with minor variations, so it may seem like duplication, but for someone trying to get something just right, that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered
OneCare is not a tweaker's friend. It has no knobs and gizmos for power users to tinker with. However, it does one thing right. It works. When you use it, you truly do have one care. Do what it tells you to make it green. If you can do that, your computer is safe from viruses, hackers, malware, spyware, known security vulnerabilities, low disk space, slow disk access, and data that is not backed up.OneCare takes a layered approach to keep you and your data safe. It has an inbound firewall to keep bad stuff out of your computer. If bad stuff gets through the firewall, it has antivirus to stop it from affecting your system and an outbound firewall to keep it from spreading. If that doesn't stop the bad stuff, it makes sure you have a backup of your data on a separate drive or on CDs.In the past, I haven't bought security products. There are plenty of free ones on the market that do a satisfactory job. However, ever since I tried OneCare as a beta tester, I fell in love with it. It is simple to use.Reduce your worries about being online down to OneCare and try it today. You can even install it on other computers to help keep friends and family protected
I was afraid at first not to order directly from Adobe but decided to take the cheaper route. It was obviously worth it - everything arrived perfectly - wrapped up, original CD set, etc.Shipped in record time as well.Eyal
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice  ignoramus than I. Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used. Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty. Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9. Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program. I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen. But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle. When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW! What an overall improvement!! Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close. With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool. The intuitive menus are nice too. Also cool is that all the text  paragraph and fill  stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them. Aaaahh! Finally some help for dunces like me. Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool. The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted. But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on. I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the confounding quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all. The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics. And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions. Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience. But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet. The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs. In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional design stuff but not for a living. But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9. Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone.
I feel Home Designer Suite 6 is a good value for the price. It obviously is not a full blown pro program, which I think many people expect, however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling. Those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning. It is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual, or on the provided CD
This package is very complete and easy to use.  Took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts, et.  A lot of the tools are intuitive and simple
This is a good software for casual use (hiking, biking, geocaching), but not without issues. On the positive side, it definitely beats all non-digital (scanned USGS maps) alternatives. The level of details is good enough(how many of us need to know topography down to 5 feet?). The fact that maps are digitally generated (with vectors I believe) makes all the labels clear at any scale. It has two advantages over its main "digital" competitor, NG Topo. First, all of the US is on one DVD for the price of separate state/region CDs from NG. And second, it is available. I could not even find NG's Northeast edition anywhere on the web! One might think NH and ME are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations.Now the few negatives. The Exchange feature with GPS is flaky. Sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my Garmin. Part of it could be that low and mid range GPS still have serial connection and are not truly plug-and-play even with COM-to-USB adapter (beats me why Garmin can't make all their GPS with USB in this day and age). In any case, regardless of whose  fault it is, it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly.The second problem I noticed was with the 3-D window. It clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if I do a lot of rapid rescaling. I ended up just closing that window, since it is pretty much for "coolness" and does not add any real topographical value.Finally, I had a problem with Delorme's service. I purchased it from Amazon with a rebate offer. However, a month after submitting the necessary info I received a card from Delorme stating that the bar code I sent was not a UPC code. The box only had one bar code on it so I am not sure how I could have made a mistake. They requested that I send a correct one, but with the code cut out and gone, how do they expect me to come up with one?! I feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but $20 is not worth the time arguing with them over it. I would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem.
There are complaints about Win XP SP2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems.It is too expensive, but it is the standard at so many companies, big and small, around the world.I just wanted to say that anyone who gives Windows XP SP2 a one star rating really doesn't understand much about the Windows operating system, and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general.The price is a bit high, but Windows is what it is...  a dominant operating system
I didn't encounter any problems with this product infact it was much easier to use and it allows you to combine and orginaze text files, chart spreadsheets, drawings, PDF documents and more into a single compressed package with advanced security features it also has many tools, overall this product was fantastic and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The interface and toolbars might be annoying but that is just a slight problem since it can be taken down and become more user friendly. The other reviewers who complained about this being slower need to know that this is just the standard edition which I use, there is a better edition which is The Professional Full Product of Adobe Acrobat 7.0 that also includes an upgrade.....
The product is easy to use.  Like how it intergrates with MS Office applications.  It's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients
I have viewed PDF files for years, never made one before. The installation was simple, and converting Word, Excel or other files to PDF is one click away. Only annoying thing is the software insisting that it install toolbars everywhere but that is easily remedied
I have been using Adobe Acrobat for a few years now.  I've used both their Professional and Standard versions.  Now, Adobe has released Acrobat 7.  In this review, I will be discussing primarily the features of the Standard edition.  However, these features are also available in the Professional edition.  Outside of the fact that the Professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features, these programs are the basically same.  I have noted any features available only in Professional in this review.  First, what is PDF and what can it do for me?Adobe's PDF is now a universal format that allows you to preserve the look and integrity of your original documents - Adobe PDF files look exactly like the original pages and fulfill requirements for electronic filing and document security.Not only that, but you can share the files with anyone, whether on a PC or a Mac.  Each PDF file has the graphics and fonts imbedded into the file.  The user of  the file does not have to have the same font set, nor even purchase Adobe Acrobat, because the Reader version of Acrobat is free!New Features in Acrobat 7*	Turn MS Outlook email into searchable documents.  This is a great feature.  It allows you to effortlessly turn those old emails into the universal PDF format.  Acrobat's searching capabilities make even searching through the longest emails easy and accurate.*	Attaching source files.  Previously, we have been able to create  PDFs from spreadsheet and other formats.  Now, not only can you do that, but this new feature allows you to attach the documents with the PDF!*	Improved Browser.  Acrobat's browser has been improved to make searching for documents easier.  If you are familiar with the Adobe Photoshop browser, you'll like the new upgraded browser in Acrobat 7.*	Searching improved.  The search feature has been improved when you are looking for files.  It is easier to search for files, because now Adobe has made the feature more friendly.

I consult will many business persons and they are just astounded at what Acrobat 7 can actually do for their business.  Just the fact that you can collect and assemble output from different types of programs into on universal format floors them every time!  Another great point about assembling the documents in Acrobat is the compression factor.  With Acrobat, users are able to compress the original documents, thus saving space and making it more efficient to transmit the documents via email or internet downloads.This new version can now also create, and save "PDF/A" files for archiving and it allows users to  scan paper documents directly into a searchable PDF file saving space and time.  Many companies around the country are making the jump to the "paperless" environment.  Acrobat 7 can definitely help.In fact, I know of an attorney's office making great use of Acrobat.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.  Even legal documents can be approved, digitally signed and verified in Acrobat.Anyone concerned about the security of their documents has nothing to fear.  Acrobat's security features including the ability to create self-signed digital IDs are terrific; no matter if you have PDF documents loaded on your website for downloading to clients or if you are emailing the files.  For Professional users, Adobe has added a new feature called E-envelopes.  With the new E-Envelopes, user can package their PDF files in an encrypted wrapper and send those files securely via email.  For company networks, Adobe has also added support for your company-wide security policies using a new feature called Lifecycle Policy Service.  The granularity of the security allows the user to pick exactly what they will allow the recipient of the file to do like printing, copying, pasting and so on.  Many people are also surprised that Acrobat isn't just for static documents.  Users can create interactive forms (Professional Only) as well.  In fact, I know a client who is an attorney.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.For CAD and graphics professionals who work with 3D files, Acrobat 7 (Professional Only) can now convert these into PDF format for ease of viewing, whether in electronic or printed format.  This will allow the users to quickly send their clients views of the 3D object in the universal PDF format without the purchase of additional software for the recipient of the file.Another feature is the new licensing capability that Adobe has added to Acrobat 7.  You can install the program and activate it on two separate computers, which is great if you work at home and at the office as well.  Need to install it on a third computer?  Not a problem.  The transfer activation feature allows you to transfer the license to another computer.  To do this, deactivate one copy and transfer the activation via a simple menu command. If your computers have internet access, the change happens right away.  This feature alone may save users money on purchasing multiple copies of the software.SummaryI would highly recommend this product to anyone in business.  The easy of use and versatility of Adobe Acrobat 7 make it an indispensable tool,  whether you are a legal professional, an IT company, accounting firm, healthcare company or anyone else in business.This is one investment where the ROI will definitely outweigh the purchase price of the software within weeks of normal use.  The ability to go paperless and save valuable office space that is now gobbled up by filing cabinets, paper binds and closets alone should make the difference for almost any company.Testing SetupTo conduct tests of the software, the following hardware was used:PC Compatible System (2 GHz Athlon Processor, 512 MB Ram, 30 GB HD)Epson Scanner/Fax/PrinterHP LaserJet 8150DN PrinterFor software tests (conversion to PDF format), the following software was used:MS Office 2003 (Word, Excel, Outlook)Photoshop CSLoren ElksGroup Manager, D-MAG.or
I'm a longtime Mac user and for re-naming and archiving and cataloguing thousands of images iView Media Pro is the best, I really like the feature that let's you produce and publish on-line galleries of your images, without any code or html experience, using only a very simpe interface and you're ready to go.For the full-time photographer or amateur, I highly recomend it
This is an all around awesome product. I have had great experiences with the program, and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school's yearbook. Anyone one who says it doesn't have the basics is pretty much lying to you, it has anything you'll ever need and more. The people who review this product poorly do so because they don't know how to use everything in it. The only problem I've ever had is learing everything you can do with it, otherwise it is perfect
Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great.I tested the integration between InDesign CS2 and some of its counterparts in the Adobe Creative Suite Premium.  I created different graphics in Photoshop CS2 and Illustrator CS2 and I found it was really easy to import them into InDesign CS2 and use.  You can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in InDesign CS2.  No need to go to another program.  With the Control Palette you can also resize objects too.  This palette functions with Transform and Stroke features for graphics, and it includes paragraph, character and table features for text editing.  What the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text. I imported some formatted text in from Microsoft Word 2003 and two different tables in from Microsoft Excel 2003.  I was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from Microsoft Excel.  The tables imported easily. With InDesign CS2, you can now automatically style Microsoft Word files on import by mapping Word styles to InDesign CS2 styles as well.An issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with InDesign CS2.  Now, Adobe "bridges" that gap.  Bridge now comes as a part of InDesign CS2 and the Premium Suite.  So, viewing any Adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do.  Using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well.  Adobe Bridge is a standalone program.Being a Web Designer and using Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Dreamweaver 8, I was familiar with using Snippets.  These are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else.  Now,  InDesign CS2 offers this Snippet capability.  You can export objects as snippets. These objects can be shared or reused in other documents. Simply place or drag a snippet into a layout, and  InDesign re-creates the original objects, their formatting, and their relative positioning on the page.  No more wasted time redesigning, just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit.InDesign CS2 also now has an Info palette that is just like those found in Photoshop and Illustrator.  Size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the Info palette.  This is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area.  It's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working.Sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work, you have to move objects.  When this happens, your structure can often change in different ways.  InDesign CS2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts, pull quotes, margin notes, and graphics to text. You can now precisely control the positioning of Anchored Objects, apply text wrap settings, and more.As with other Adobe products, it is very easy to export your finished work in PDF format.  InDesign CS2 works so well at exporting to PDF, it even maintains the layers in Acrobat 7.  You can pre-define your Acrobat export settings as well.  InDesign CS2 also supports specialty PDF formats like PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, which are used in workflows.  It also supports high-resolution CMYK output and color-managed workflows.If you are familiar with previous versions of InDesign, the upgrade to the new version is easy.  InDesign CS2 is even backwards compatible CS.  You will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased.Loren Elks, Group ManagerD-MAG.or
This product is so good. I love it! I can make my own MP3's, make disk copies and archive data files. I'm curious to see how DVD movies are made with this product. I'm very happy with this item. The price is very pleasing as well.
This is the easiest way I've ever been able to make CD's. It realy makes photo CD's easy and produces a great product. A group of frinds and Us just got back from Mexico and I put all of everyones photos in separate files on a CD. The automatic slide show goes through the differn't files as if they were just one file with no seperation, but the pictures are still separated in each person's file for ease when printing and so forth. It's great, wish I would have had this years ago
I have used this software from the very first as a PaintShop product and it still delivers. It has improved with this version. I reckon I have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best. For more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program. What it claims to do, it does well. If only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones. A simple histogram would make this a top ranking program
I liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times. I always shoot with Nikon RAW format. It has hung a couple of times and I had to kill it after waiting for 10-15 minutes.
I bought this CD for my two grandchildren for Christmas. They have all the other Nancy Drew CD's that are out and really enjoy playing them. They are a good interactive game to challenge their minds. I am sure this one will too
This new Nancy Drew game was fun to play! It was shipped on time and arrived in good condition.
I liked how you could go underwater and try to find things. I also liked how you had to bake cookies and make sundaes. Another really cool thing was that you could buy stuff for Minette and yourself. I didn't like how the tea was so hard,though.I couldn't figure it out,but finally I got it.I liked that you had to fight Minette,too.It was funny that she had an alien tatoo on her face.Over all,Danger By Design was a fun game.
I really enjoy the Nancy Drew games. They can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a Junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done. The check list continues to update as you move through the game. I look forward to each new game as it comes out and can't leave the computer until they are done
I have been playing the Nancy Drew games for a few years now, and have found that with each one the graphics, intrigue  fun just keep getting better  better.In "Danger by Design" Nancy agrees to go to Paris to help a nervous investor of Minette's House of Fashion.  He's nervous because Minette had begun acting very strangely  had fallen way behind on her new Spring collection - both of which could lead to a failed business venture.Once there, Nancy becomes aware of several threatening letters the designer had received, as well as a number of rumors concerning artwork that had been stolen during World War II that may be hidden in the old Wind Mill that now serves as Minette's House of Fashion.  Could they be related some how?As Nancy Drew, you will find yourself snooping around for clues, working to earn the money needed to buy several needed items, solving various puzzles, and ultimately putting all the information together to solve the mysteries surrounding Minette  the stolen artwork.Overall, I loved "Danger by Design".  It has the best graphics to date for an ND game  it was great fun to play.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed playing other such games, as well as those who enjoyed (or are enjoying) reading the ND series.  
Although not perfect, I've used Roxio CD/DVD 6 Platinum and Nero 6, and returned to using this product. This should also be called Burning CD's for Dummies, it is THAT easy to use. I've also used it to burn VCD's without a hitch. If all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler, this is for you
If you decide to buy a current greeting card program, there are really only two front-line choices: Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory (currently version 5) or Hallmark Card Studio (currently 2006). There are other programs available specifically for creating cards, but most of them are low quality and outdated, and aren't really worth considering. (A competitive third product featuring American Greetings designs is sadly now long outdated; the designs in the American Greetings program were of similar quality to those in the Hallmark package).So how do these two products match up? Without a question, if you are looking for quality "canned" cards, the Hallmark program wins. The Hallmark designs are professional, and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store. In contrast, the designs in Art Explosion are adequate but surely NOT up to the quality of a store-bought card. The Hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store (although you are stuck with the choices pre-programmed into the software unless you want much frustration). The Art Explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations.Art Explosion beats the Hallmark program in editing options (more extensive), and in the amount of additional art (clipart, etc.) included with the package.If you do not plan to use the "canned" cards, then I would recommend Art Explosion. But the average user will likely appreciate the professional, high quality cards in the Hallmark package. Personally, I consider the choice of the Hallmark package over Art Explosion a no brainer. A note on versions: The publisher comes out with a new version of the Hallmark program every year (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, etc.) and the same is true for Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory. Having used many of these versions, I find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year. Disappointingly, the stock cards in the Hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years, and the same is true for Art Explosion.
This program does exactly as I expect. I am very pleased
I buy a lot of cards and they are always Hallmartk because I there quality is wonderful.  The kit is of the same high quality.  It also lets you personalize them with your own text and your own pictures.  It was one of the best things I ever bought and I know I well use it a lot
Purchased for my mom to use and she loves it. She says it is easy to use and she really enjoys making personalized cards for people. If she's happy with it, so am I
I am enjoying this new card shop they have refreshing great cards others do not. My friends and family that I have made cards for think they are the best also. Keep making more and more. Thank
This program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful.Installation is self explanatory. This also goes for the prepararation of cards ect.Detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse-pointer over various portions of the graphics. If you are looking for an easy to use program with great results, this is the one to get. With the cost of cards being what it is, this program will pay for itself very quickly. Relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized. I recommend this  program highly
I rate this 5 stars based on my knowledge of the Fantastic Four and X-Men complete editions.  I'm writing this review to warn people about my receiving 2 defective copies of the Spider-Man version from Amazon.  I'll have to try a 3rd time
My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels (ie. ,,,,). Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it
This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment
Nice collection of the complete issues, though, of course, one knows going in that the later Marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story, which is somewhat frustrating.  And the earliest years are, of course, somewhat crude (heretically, even the Kirby artwork in the first year is).But very nice to have in an affordable edition, regardless of the flaws (though best viewed with a large monitor
I couldn't have found a better X-Men product. Every mag. has its own PDF. The readability is only limited by the size of your monitor
I've tried this on two different mac computers: an emac desktop and  an ibook G4, it runs perfectly on both. I see that some people are having problems, I'll see if I can help with that at the end of the review.I'm a huge x-men fan, but can't afford to buy a bunch of back-issues. The essential book collections are affordable, but they're printed in black  white. With this one disc you get almost 500 uncanny issues, including annuals, all are high-quality scan in's. The disc also has a nice little bio section, and comes with the neccessary adobe software. The one down-side is that you miss out on he tie-in issues, whick gets irritating mid-90's, but I'm not docking a star for that because   what you get is well worth the price, and it's clearly stated in the description that this is strictly "uncanny". OK, for those of you having trouble getting it to run w/ a mac here's the process:load cd, click cd image on your desktop twice. You'll get a finder window w/ various files/folders, one will have install on it, this should be the adobe software, follow the installation instructions, and move your new adobe reader to applications when finished, restart your computer. Once re-started load the cd again, open adobe reader 6.0 click the folder image in the upper left-hand corner you should have a finder-type window, go to desktop, click on x-men and choose start.pdf. You should be good to go. HT
All I have to say is 485 comics for 40 dollars.  Or about 40 years worth.  That's like a dollar a year.  You do the math...it's an amazing deal.  Also, quality is great and you can print them if you want
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice  ignoramus than I.  Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used.  Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty.  Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9.  Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program.  I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen.  But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle.When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW!  What an overall improvement!!Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close.  With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool.  The intuitive menus are nice too.  Also cool is that all the text  paragraph and fill  stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them.  Aaaahh!  Finally some help for dunces like me.Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool.  The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted.But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on.  I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all.  The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics.  And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions.  Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience.  But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet.The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs.  In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional stuff but not for a living.  But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9.  Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone
This new version of Illustrator is great, glad I upgraded! The Live Trace feature is cool
I was waiting for CS2 after using the CS. There are too many problems in CS. And I am very happy with CS2 now. The software is a lot easier to use, less problems. I have been using illustrator since illustrator 4. CS2 is definitly better than ever!
Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good.Why ruin things with an upgrade
OK, sorry, I've been vectoring line art since 1990. My current machine is an AMD Athlon XP with the 333 FSB, 1 Gig ram  80 Gig HD shared on network  a 40 Gig HD for software, OS is XPpro, it's 2 years old I think. I installed three cathode ray tubes, you know; big boxy monitors, the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day. I read the reviews here and started "Quaking" in my boots! Oops I said to myself, and I looked up my previous day's purchases for the new Artist I just hired. Sure enough; I bought CS2 for the new machine. So I downloaded the 30 day trial for Illustrator CS2 Upyours, I mean Upgrade. Replacing my old Illustrator 8.01 These kids I've been interviewing made me think I should take a look outside MY CAVE! So I got it loaded up and sure enough; it takes longer to load than my old corrupted rusty buddy; Illustrator 8.01, about twice as long. ( so leave it running )!!!!!!!!! BUT WOW !!!!!!!I should have done this sooner, or should I have ?As soon as It was running Illustrator CS2 AUTO UPDATED ITSELF.It wanted it's Adobe Bridge fixed up. So I let it. This is just exactly what people have been complaining about.******** THE BRIDGE IS FIXED *********WAY SUPER COOL DUDE! I keep the Bridge open on the right monitor and I can drag art into Illustrator CS2 at lightning speed. The whole time I get to see super big previews of all the artwork I need to work with. Way better than XPpro's little thumbnails.LIVE TRACE: Realy nice, I think this is what these companies are using to sell Vectored Line Art to Printers like me. It is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now, took a human brain to see past while vectoring. OK, it's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as (full of) myself, but for only about $160 or so, it's like a gift from ALMIGHTY GOD!No crashes, no bugs, just pure inteligence from Adobe once again.Don't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say ADOBE?I really apreciate the Object Oriented work bar thing at the top, wait, let me go look at what it's called, Hmmmm, still don't know, well it changes according to what kind of object you've clicked on in your artwork. Also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work. That top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in Photoshop.Transparent objects, looks like everything can be transparent, WOW, do you know what that means ??? I gotta go use it some more, it's just way to cool. OK, I'm back, EVEN FONTS can be transparent, .tiffs .jpgs, everything. THIS MEANS way less jumping back and forth from Photoshop to Illustrator.But I do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware, operating system, and have at least a year; full time with Illustrator and Photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that Adobe has opened up for us
As one who is not an accountant, I found Quickbooks Premier Non-Profit Edition 2006 to be very easy to learn. Read the books that come with the software before you dive in
Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product.To accomplish the reports that I need, I am able to edit the Gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose.  So, it gets the report done, just not as nicely as I had hoped.Tracking work is made incredibly simple.  Rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software
I decided to get this office suite after using it recently. I've usually worked on Office 97 and 2000, but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions. The feature that I really enjoy is the Pivot Report feature in MS Access, which wasn't in MS Access 2000. This is a truly great reporting feature. You can now use Access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase and other enterprise-type databases. If you're used to creating crosstab reports, you'll definitely like the Pivot Report feature. Crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there's no limitation on the number of dimensions in Pivot Report.To me, the main drawback is the price. (I did get mine at around $370 at J, which is a great price.) I figure I can upgrade this in about 5 years time, which works out to about $70 to $75 per year (assuming that I'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time.)A big positive is that this is the industry standard. So the work you put into learning the multiple new features of Word, Excel, MS Access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job. Your time will be well spent. Note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful. Different features are useful to different people...Another positive: Each product in Office Professional is fully programmable using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which you can use to build custom programs. This very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for Office suites. 
You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it. I'm not going to criticize anyone except to say IF you have a question or problem, the ZA website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company's products. There are some compatibility probs for example with Yahoo Mail BETA. As soon as Yahoo finalizes it's mail server ZA will be compatible. Simply switch back to yahoo mail (pre beta). There are several other beta products but generally if you're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs. ZA REALLY is better at what it is suppose to do than other products ONCE you have learned how to use it. Kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar. I use the free stuff too, and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students, etc. but the ZA suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who can't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway. I know what you're thinking btw...but ask yourself "Is your private information, time  and computer worth it to you?" If so go with Zone Alarm, learn how to use it and be safer on the net.John Rowin1ea
As you can see by other reviews above, the Studio series has a history of being buggy.  You also hear a lot of people saying "This package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other 'powerful enough to be worth owning' packages -- if only it were more stable!"  I am one of those long-suffering users (5 years, going back to Version 9), and finally with Version 10.6 I have stopped complaining -- it now works as I'd hoped when I bought it.  The $300 I spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted -- I kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual couldn't clarify.  And I'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures.I am turning all of our old family video tapes and CD's into DVD's.  I use Studio for all the editing (have not tried the DVD recording -- just use Roxio for that) and am now very pleased.  If you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download.One important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems: put every "project" you work on in a separate subdirectory.  If you have 5 soccer game videos make a /game1, /game2 etc. series of subfolders.  If you edit those to a "Jimmy's great plays" proect, put it in a separate /JimmyPlays folder.  When projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5.  I learned this trick before 10.6 came out, and I don't know if it matters any more but I take no chances.Why did I stick with something where I admit that version 9.0 was "powerful but unstable" and 10.0 was "more powerful and more unstable"?  Because I can actually use Studio with minimal reference to instructions, and when I use it things turn out as I expect.  Now that it has become stable and reliable I am a VERY satisfied customer.So that's how I got from being a frustrated Studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review.  I tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions, but that "10.5 updated for free to 10.6" really is the best choice out there now... as my unused expensive rivals to Studio on my shelf prove.  Just keep putting every project inn its own folder!
I have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product. I have created numerous videos of my children's escapades and sporting events. I do have one warning however. Provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen. The software is extremely intuitive and easy to use. My wildest expectations were exceeded.
Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.
I have read several reviews and decided the Spyder2Pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me.   I have a Samsung 970P monitor with all adjustments via software.   The calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process.I like the Spyder2Pro and would recommend it highly.
It does the basic job well.  The calibration runs smoothly and accurately.  Hardware looks and feels solid.  My two completely different brand, size and age CRT monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side.  User interface is merely adequate.  Pop up help instructions are better than many I have seen.  You will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work (the hardwired buttons on the monitor, not software).  In order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over.  Sometimes you can use "back" within the calibration, sometimes you must start over.  Also the separate "profile chooser" utility software, has not add or delete profile feature - even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier.  You can see it with windows display properties, but it may not appear in the profile chooser list.Dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version.  Yes, it does dual monitors, but with an asterisk.  It will create separate profiles, but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards.  If you have a single video card with dual outputs, it will load the same profile (the last one you created) to both monitors at startup.  This quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk (and blames windows for the problem), but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material, catalogs,  or on the box.  Fortunately there is a work around (not documented) at least with my particular video card and running XP.  After windows opens, you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor.  You may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default. Once it's all set up, running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure, but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles.  And check it after you open the application.  I've had them change after opening photoshop - though not every time.                           
This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack.However, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with "Colloquial Icelandic" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- "Hva" is pronounced "kwah?" WHAT? Having "Colluquial Icelandic" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook.I gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course
I installed it in my new computer with the easy to follow steps and I find that it gives me wonderful protection.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  I am very satisfied.  I feel my computer is very well protected
I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP.  It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user.
This is a great productbecause once you install itYou need not use the cd agai
It is wondeful software.  Simple, easy to use, user-friendly, and very accurate in the pronunciation.Buy this CD.  Don't waste your money on the subscription at merriam-webster's website.ALso try the Medical dictionary.  It is as equally superb
I used this program on a 5-state road trip of the Midwest, and while overall it was  "adequate," it had some key shortcomings.The bad stuff:First, this is not an especially user-friendly program; there is a steep learning curve to operate it with ease and predictability. Spend a LOT of time playing with this BEFORE using it as a primary navigator! A lot of the commands are not intuitive, and you need to go through a lot of menus to figure things out. This can be a problem when you are on the road looking to get somewhere. It doesn't have a lot of clickable buttons on the main screen. For example, to get the program to TALK to you, you must be on a certain tab at the bottom of the screen. If you are on any other of the many tabs, the program doesn't talk to you or show you the turns. It took me HOURS to figure this out! The help function was useless.Second, the tracking can be very slow, and as a result you can easily overshoot your turns--especially when there are no physical street signs in many areas of the country--which happened to me numerous times. Many times the screen showed me I had a lot farther to go before the scheduled turn, and this caused me to overshoot it when there was no sign.Third, the "rerouting" function is AWFUL and perhaps the biggest problem with this program: if you stray from the route--even to pull off and get gas--the program flips out and keeps trying to route you back to the original route even if that route is not the easiest or most direct. I have not found a way for it to manually or automatically calculate a new and different route. I also have found no way to modify a route once you begin the route (see below).Several times in several different cities, the re-routing function was totally wrong--spitting out names of streets that weren't even on the screen at close zoom level. This is a really annoying glitch, and it happened without fail every time I strayed from the route. Once off route, there is no way to hush the program from yelling at you that you're off route, and there is also no way to easily have the program recalculate a CHANGE in the route. When there is construction that you didn't anticipate, for example, this program sucks at being able to change the route once you've started on it. Very annoying. There is no construction updater plug-in, which would be helpful for long term construction projects that go on forever. Fourth, the program does NOT audibly warn you if you are going the wrong way on a one way street. This actually happened to me, as there were no "one way" signs on a particular street in Springfield, IL. Though there were green arrows on the screen to indicate one-way, but the voice commands didn't warn me that I actually WAS going the wrong way, so had I not been looking at the screen, I wouldn't have known. You can't always look at the screen when driving. And in Iowa on I35, construction brought northbound drivers over to the southbound lanes. I was heading north in the southbound lanes (as I was supposed to) but there was no visual or audible indication that I was going the wrong way! Big time safety issue here.Fifth, the search function is wholly lacking and is not easy to use. I needed to find a police station while in Missouri--no such luck. I also needed to find the state fairgrounds in Missouri (which I later came across on the screen) but it did not show up when I intentionally searched for it. Search limitations are the second biggest problem with this program.Sixth, several times the screen showed me "off route" in a totally blacked-out area with no roads around me when I was in fact on a U.S. highway or interstate. Something wasn't communicating correctly. Other times the screen showed me more than 1000 feet off the highway even though I was certainly on the highway. In Illinois, the screen showed I was pretty much driving through corn fields even though I was on a U.S. Route. This problem is pronounced on multi-lane highways. If you're not in the center lane, often the program indicates you're off route. Very annoying.Seventh, the zoom level does not stay constant; it fluctuates automatically between high zoom and far-out zoom. I wanted high zoom most of the time to see all the minor roads and landmark indicators, but the program kept zooming out and in every few minutes.Eighth, the help function is a joke. It is totally lacking in substantive information. The program should come with a separate DVD movie showing how to use it.Ninth, the program does not recognize a lot of road name synonyms. For example, some U.S. Routes also have county/state/local designation numbers and/or an alphabetic name, but the map often only listed one or two of the many "also known as" names/numbers. This can be quite problematic when the signs on the roads don't match up with the turn commands (e.g. "Turn left on U.S. route 40," when the only street signs showed an alphabetic name and no numbers. This was also quite annoying.Tenth, the antenna that comes with the program SUCKS. Without fail, I would get a red "no signal" indicator in every city I was in where there were high-rise buildings. This happened in Kansas City, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Springfield. If you are in a city, you risk having no GPS tracking ability. And yes, my antenna was mounted as recommended. At one point I held it up through my open sun roof with no success.Eleventh, the main-screen buttons are way too small for use while driving if the laptop is on your passenger's seat. You pretty much have to pull over OR risk crashing to see what you're clicking on. Yes, I'm aware that the disclaimer for the program states you should have a separate navigator to operate the program while driving. I'm also aware that almost no one who uses this program actually has a navigator/operator.Twelfth, trip planning is lacking. When you input a starting and ending point, the program gives you ONE route. There is no way to easily plan alternate routes or to preview them. True, you can do things like program it not to take you on toll roads, but this function is not easy to use. Several times the program kept me off the interstates when I wanted to be on them, and sometimes it kept my on the interstates when I wanted to be on U.S. or smaller county roads (for sightseeing purposes). I would have to go off route and listen to the program whine about being off route.Thirteenth, I emailed a list of my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations to the folks at Delorme. Never heard back from them, which does concern me as a quality issue.Ok, so there were some redeeming qualities:First, *in general* the GPS tracker was on-target. For about 95% of my 2000-mile trip, I knew where I was and the program operated just fine. Just realize that this program (as well as GPS in general) has a lot of limitations, ESPECIALLY when there is bad weather or you are in a woodsy area or place with a lot of obstructions.Third, you can easily add points of interest and comments yourself. I used this function a lot to mark places where I want to return to take photos in daylight.Fourth, there is a selectable function to show high contrast colors (black background with bright road colors). This is quite helpful.In summation, for the money this program is a good deal, but do NOT rely on it (or any GPS program) as your *sole* source of road information/navigation. If I hadn't had my Rand McNally paper road atlas and back-up state and city maps I borrowed from the library, I would have been in big trouble several times.There are a LOT of ways this program can and should be improved, but in the meantime I'd still recommend it despite the problems. Knowing the limitations that I've listen can save you time and frustration. There is no better alternative IMHO for the price. It's possible that some of my complaints DO have fixes, but you wouldn't know it from the crappy help function.
This is my first experience with GPS.  This product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions.  Viewing the screen on a Laptop as opposed to most of the Portable GPS units is a definite advantage to the user.  I would purchase another immediately if the need arose. . 
i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .
I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website
This one is definately the best out of all of the previous ACID Music programs.  It has a ton of loops, a really cool looking skin, and much more options than in ACID 1.0 or 2.0.  It comes with two CDs.  One of them has the application on it with some loops and the other CD has nothing but loops and demo songs!  It has over 1,600 unique loops!  Definately a good buy for those who really liked any of the previous ACID Musics
Having trouble figuring out how to make a corner cabinet for sinks. Any help will be appreciated.  Kroh
This is a good package for backing up your PC.  Fairly intuitive, although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so I could select the right stuff to backup.  It uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup.  The downside of that is you can't just select a file to restore, you must go through the restore process.  You can select a single file, but it takes a bit of time.  Runs automatically and unobtrusively so it won't interfere with your current work. 
I am not a "computer person" but found this to be easy, easy, easy
Excellent product for backup with the intelligence built into it. Highly recommended
I loved the experience, especially with the smart picks, smart templates, smart search, and smart rank.  I recommend it to any user.  Very happy with the product!  Thanks Eisenworld, Thanks Alohabob
This is unbelievable---it can tell the importance of the stuff on my PC. And I also can set a Weekly Backup task on my PC. This is fantastic. It is so straigh forward and easy to use. I will definately recommend this product to everyone I know.Well done, Alohabob!!!
I had access to the CD version of this product that came with the Image Library Catalog in the box. I liked using it and although there was a lot of CD disc-trading with 34 discs, it worked well for me. I could usually go to the disc I wanted on the first attempt.Later, I wanted to add this collection to my home office and went back to the same store where the original version was bought. They had sent back all the CD editions where the image catalog was included in the box and replaced them with the DVD edition that is only 5 discs and you have to send off for the catalog for the low low price of shipping ($4.95). Whenever I go to use the DVD's, I have to wait a long time for the dics to load into memory and almost forever if I request the thumbnail versions to come up in the browser.I would rather switch discs any day then spend my time staring at the monitor while waiting for the computer to load my information. The store involved is happy because they are using less box space on the shelf (or so the stock personnel said). I am unhappy at having to send off for the manual that says it's included on the box but isn't, the extra money for the shipping, and the awkwardness to use this 'upgraded' product
Good for those looking for a vector collection.  Not so good for those looking for photo clip art, as photos are "high-res" at 200 DPI.  I suppose the photos are useful to an extent, but the usefulness is limited by size.  I was looking for vector art, so I am satisfied
I've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and I finally broke down and bought it.  Very pleased with everything included.  LOTS of stuff to use, and not just cheezy clip art - lots of boarders, symbols, brush strokes, etc.  The bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc (disc 3 was actually disc 30) - one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked. 
   I am so pleased with this purchase!! Under normal circumstances if I spend anything over $1.00 I get caught in a spiral of buyers regret. This is a feeling that I have grown accustomed to. When I received the 800,000 through the mail I shredded open the box and started skimming through what new images I could play with. I was astonished!         Then, I realized something.....or rather a lack of something. I felt no remorse for buying this! I finally had a collection of clip art that could provide an abundant amount of images for collages, labels, calendars, scrapbooks, and everything else I wanted to do. 
For many who like writing HTML/XHTML code, Homesite holds a special place in the heart.  It just feels so right and is addictive.The tool can be extended, and the extensions use script which makes the development cycle dead easy.Support from MacroMedia has not been good.  Now Adobe is in the process of buying Macromodia (as on 2005-04-19) so who knows where it all goes.  Saying that people who like this product still like it and prefer it.  If it fits you don't need support.  You just run it day after day and it works great.(There are alternatives emerging after all these years but none quite do it yet.  CSE and TopStyle are two that are coming along.)For some it almost seems perfect, for WYSIWYG oriented people, it might be best not to even look at it
Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie.One of the things I like best about Homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in ASP.NET. I was able to find a plug-in, which when added to Homesite, recognized the .NET tags and colors them accordingly. There are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there.If you are unfamiliar with HomeSite, are considering a purchase, but are not sure it's the right tool for you, here's a very brief description on how it works: This is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you. It is, in essence, a text editor on steroids. As you code BY HAND it will color the code for you, tell you when you've made errors, offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean, has a built in FTP client, helps you organize your work into projects, and a bunch of other functions I've never used.Here's the main thing you need to know: If you're a HomeSite pro, then you are also a REAL developer.To everyone who has whined about lack of support: What do you expect for less then $100? If you purchase a flagship product from Macromedia such as Dreamweaver, Studio MX, or Fireworks, you'll get all the support you'll need.Also, I've been able to find PLENTY of FREE support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development. For every problem or question I've found someone who knows the solution. You can too!!!Just a note: Amazon is behind the times. From the Macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what Amazon is offering.Well worth the $99.00
Great program but the fact that you can't lock the toolbar into place leads to major amounts of time wasted.  Homesite kind of peaked at version 3 when it was run by Alaire
...and I knew it wouldn't be the last. Very very fun. Don't think Nancy Drew is just for girls, guys can play and love the game as well. I am living proof of that.The game itself really isn't that hard, it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky (I don't like puzzles) and that is the only 'beef' I have with the game, and most mystery games. Now, back to the game itself.. intriguing storyline, suspicous characters and they all got something to hide. Search for clues while interrogating suspects.. explore the resort, run errands, break into locked rooms without getting caught, disable alarms, and SNOOP.. and that is just the tip of the iceburg.If  you like mystery games, Nancy Drew is for you! Her games aren't overly hard, and they are very fun. Even if you aren't a mystery fan, try it! You'll love it. Try them all! You will become a Nancy Drew fan, trust me.. I did
This was a wonderful game!  Hours of good, solid game play.  An interesting mystery and intriguing characters.  A chance to interact with aquatic life.  I learned how to work a GPS and a HAM radio.  It was so much fun.  The puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types.  Word puzzles, spatial puzzles, problem-solving ones.  I can completely recommend this game
I had a LOT of fun playing this game and look foward to playing more Nancy Drew products.  It was interesting and I couldn't WAIT to solve the mystery!  I enjoyed myself a lot! 
This is by far my favourite HER Interactive Nancy Drew PC game, and I have played them all multiple times. I loved the food aspect of it [my sister's a chef], in the cafe where you could gyp the game into letting Nancy have a muffin or a bowl of delicious New England clam chowder anytime you wanted to making a sandwich for Katie; AND calling Bess and George to hear how Bess is learning to cook from a TV show and hearing her worry about what she's making.The puzzles were not nearly as difficult as some more recent games make them; they were challenging but doable, took some moving about and kept the game adventurous. The bike riding was inventive, rather than a train or car or what have you, and I loved being down by the lighthouse, near the water.I believe it is one of HER Interactive's best games so far and is the best bet for a Nancy Drew gamer
A good choice for newbies that love adventure games.  Nancy Drew's games are perfect, fresh, relaxing, but also give you a lot of thinking some times
This has been a good purchase for us.  We are in northern Italy for about 7 weeks, and needed to navigate a number of cities: for several business meetings and just to find our way around.  It has been an invaluable tool.  We have still used physical maps to a certain extent, but in finding the shortest routes, and other points of interest, this has helped us never to be lost (so far!
I'm planning a trip to Europe ( of course) and it help a lot with millage and since I plan on using my GPS from my Streets and Trip then I figure that everything is gonna be A o
Going to Europe this spring and needed this software to plan stops,etc...on our three week trek..This is excellant, as is their USA software
I'm planning a motorcylce trip in Italy this summer and the program gives me all the info I need on routes and sites of intertest along the way.  Overall a great product
If you have used MS Streets  Trips, then you'll know your way around AutoRoute.  We are using this to plan a trip to Europe next May.  Based on my knowledge of locations in Britian, the software appears to be pretty accurate.  If you want to use this with a GPS that does not come bundled with the package, expect some frustration.  I still have not figured out how to get it to talk to my USB based Garmin unit.  I think it is possible, just do not know how. 
As far as GPS software goes, there is nothing better available than Streets  Trips and AutoRoute.  There are dozens of features that you can't find with the self-contained GPS units.  It is easy to add multiple stops and to optimize them into the best order, night-view is another great feature, as are the topographical maps.  The new feature offered this year, of easy-linking to satellite photos of places on the map, is also a welcome addition.  The only reason I'm giving it a four is because of the following:1)  There is STILL no ground-level or 3D view of the roads for use in the GPS function2)  They still haven't added an option to exclude roads that ban trucks or commercial traffic form using them.3)  There isn't a lot of coverage for Eastern European countries, most notably, nothing in Russia.Nonetheless, it is still better than any other GPS software on the market
Easy to install and get started.  I purchased it to manage my digital photo's and not to do sophisticated picture editing or enhancements for publishing.  It's been easy to use for my purposes.  If you are planning on doing professional level editing or graphic manipulation, do more homework on the robustness of this product.  I can't comment on it's capabilities for that purpose
I love this product. I had a sample version of it prior to that expired, and I NEEDED to have the full edition. It came in a timely fashion as well. I am very pleased
This is a very extensive volume of expert advice on how to use Windows XP and so far I have found it helpful, although a bit too technical that is not compatible with my XP
For those already familiar, I was excited about this edition when it was advertised that it now works with RAW files.  This one of the advantages that Adobe Photoshop Elements has.  I have a Nikon Digital SLR and I often shoot in RAW and have to convert to .jpg if I want to edit with Microsoft Digital Imaging.  When I went out to buy this "Anniversary" edition, in very small print it reads that it's the same as the previous 2006 edition "except" support for RAW files is no longer included.  Still, it was on sale ($24) and I thought an upgrade would be cool.  When I used it, I saw little or no difference in this than the Microsoft Digital Image 10 I had already been using.  In my opinion, upgrading from 10 isn't worth it. For those new to this product, let me start by saying, I've been a long time user of Microsoft's digital imaging products.  I enjoy the bright, clean look of the interface.  More that that, I love how simple it is to use.  I would recommend Microsoft Digital Image to all skill levels, but especially anyone who's just starting out in Digital Photography and computers.  Hands down, it's the easiest.  It does in one step what would take three Photoshop Elements.  You sacrifice come control, but simplicity is the focus of this program.  Adobe Photoshop Elements is more powerful, but harder to use.  Bottom line is, if you want to concentrate on getting out and taking good pictures instead of spending lots of time editing, get Microsoft Digital Imaging.  For the average shutterbug, It'll edit just as good as Photoshop Elements in less time and for less money.
I have used the Hallmark Card Studio software for 6 or 7 years and the 2006 version is superior to the 2004 version.  I like having fresh cards to choose from every year or two
I have the older version which was great but doesn't seem to work on WIN XP. Both do a great job especially when you need an emergency card. 2006 edition has a great added feature of being able to choose the size format for your card, big plus. The graphics are nice and there are many choices. It's a good deal at the price
I think this program is fantastic.I have used it many times so far and have gotten many great compliments.
Very easy to use and provides a very wide range of cards and other items. Excellent product.Dav
I checked around before making this purchase, and Amazon had the best price for Print Shop.  I love it, I've used it for a couple of projects and I have no complaints.  It's like a one stop shopping for all your publishing needs
I have been using various versions of Print Shop for years. I am very impressed with the number of new inovations of this new versioon of Print Sho
Learn Catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base; however, i have taken about 5 years of Spanish and found the CD to be fairly basic, and while catalan differs in many ways, many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope.   There are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist.   I definitely have benefitted from this CD because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it.  Overall, great for beginners, and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge
AV materials for Catalan are very difficult to find.  But Catalan is certainly worth investigating, and this makes for a highly pleasant intro.  Now if only Eurotalk would come up with a second CD
Remember....this is a software program and may require you to purchase appropriate hardware to compliment!PRO's: Easy to install, somewhat intuitive to use. Up and running in no time. Imports Digital Video fairly simply. Speed of production is directly related to your equipped home computer. Stability of program is strong point. Does what it says it can do. Didn't make any coaster on first attempts to use. Finish product runs well on all DVD players.CON's: Needs more style templates. Needs an imbedded sound translator for music track imports. Steeper then normal learning curve with less then optimum manual explanations
I've only just begun using this software, but have not found it to be so easy to use for a novice at film editing or to make a slideshow. I would have liked to have seen better and more tutorials. I find the tutorial confusing. So far I have been able find most of the answers to my questions through the Help section, but it just isn't as straight forward as I would have liked. I purchased this b/c it was rated so high by PC Magazine. I'm sure in time I'll learn the software better, but it just seems more challenging and not as easy to learn as most sofware I have taught myself to use.
Simple and Great video editing software considering it is for the normal and home user. I would say it is the beginner to Intermediate user tool. I can really create fast movies very quickly. Pros:Easy to installEasy to split/edit Home videosCompatible with iLinkSupport for High Definition HDV CamcordersCompetitive priceCons: User Interface can be confusing at the beginning to understand and placement of workspace windows.Rendering is slow.
I do a pretty good bit of video production. I have used let's say most of them in the quest of finding a video editor that would do the real things I need. Ulead Video Studio 10 Plus is pretty good, but it lacks in the audio section. Pinnacle: not worth the bucks I paid for it at Best Buy. Magix: nice but seriously lacking the depth needed in the audio section.I had used Premiere Pro before and liked a lot of the features provided in it but the price, my god, was just too much. I found Premiere Elements on Amazon and hoped that it would do the job. It did.Elements 3 has almost and I say almost features as does Premiere Pro. Some features have been streamlined for the amateur but learning to use Elements has been fun and productive. I would recommend Adobe Premiere Elements 3 to any intermediate to advanced video editing person
Definitely worth the money. For example, Excel is a great program. It is pretty easy to use and not too hard to figure out. You can add up figures in a snap. This product provides a great service to companies because of the usefulness of this software.
Thanks for Office.  I bought a new H/P desktop that only had a 60-day Office trial -- and literally had to pay the price.  Thanks to you, I'm glad I didn't have to pay full retail.  Installed like a charm -- downloading sure has gotten a heck of a lot smoother.  Bless your hearts
as prommised, new in box. shipped immediately. excellent price, good     service and good first experience
I received Micrsoft Office 2003  in excellant condition. The box was sealed and in good condition. The 2003 office software is easy to use if you have used any of the previous versions. Many new features make it worthwhile to upgrade
The price was the best I could find.  Ordering was hassle free and delivery was fast
There is no other product which compares to the Microsoft Office suite. "Microsoft Office Standard Edition" is the place to get started. And it is the place you'll probably stay.You do need Word and Excel, and occasionally, PowerPoint. Learn basic word processing and spreadsheet usage. Shine in meetings with PowerPoint.Do you need to upgrade from XP? Not likely. There are no new features I found impressive after having the XP version for years.It lacks Access, but most people don't need the database strength of it, and will survive nicely with just Excel.For e-mailing documents and files to coworkers, you can be confident they'll easily open Office files. There is a good chance they use it themselves.Outlook is one of those highly underrated, but enormously useful applications to help you organize your contacts, schedule and tasks easily. You can use it as an e-mail reader as well, though that feature has been vulnerable to viruses.Word is a huge program which can do far more than you'll need, but it will allow you versatility and simplicity that WordPerfect has yet to pull off.Excel is a basic spreadsheet with incredible math functionality. I don't need most of the math tools, other than minor budgets and such. I find it handy for tracking my poetry submissions; I can see which magazine I sent which piece to when, and how and when they replied.PowerPoint makes those cool slideshows with the text that can be animated on the screen. With the templates, you can look good without requiring a graphic design degree.I fully recommend "Microsoft Office Standard Edition." It is the business and home office standard. You need it, it is easy to learn, and the price is right.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.co
I have used Synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them.  However, don't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until AFTER your current subscription runs out because Synmatec will not give you credit for the un-used portion of your previous subscription.  I asked and they said "no way".  That aspect of "customer service" is very disappointing
I installed Norton Antivirus 2007 immediately after installing Windows Vista, Office 2007 and other software on a new computer.  Installation ran smoothly.  LiveUpdate ran automatically and updated the product without a hitch.Norton AntiVirus 2007 not only detects viruses, it detects spyware and rootkits as well.  It has an inbound firewall, and apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities.  It does not protect against phishing, identity theft, or spam, nor does it contain full outbound firewall protection.When installed on Windows Vista, Norton Antivirus takes over for Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall.  I did not expect the latter; Symantec should have made it more clear that this product includes a software firewall.  Norton AntiVirus integrates well with Windows Security Center.Norton AntiVirus 2007 is noticeably quicker both in normal operation and during full scans than previous versions. Norton AntiVirus has always performed well in industry comparisons against other antivirus products. The only other product that I would use myself is McAfee VirusScan, but I have always felt that Norton AntiVirus does a more aggressive job of protecting my system.For those of you installing Norton AntiVirus 2007 as an upgrade, I would highly recommend that you first remove any existing Norton security products using Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.  Then, download and run the  Norton Removal Tool from the Symantec site to make sure that it's all gone.To see a comparison chart of the Norton 2007 Windows protection products as of this posting date, browse to Symantec's site, click on "Norton 2007 Products" under Home Products, click on related link "View All Products" and then click "Compare" next to PC Security.
I used this to help plan kitchen and bathroom makeovers. It helped me see just what we wanted
I love this product, But I wish I could see all floors put together as completed home in 3D view.
Not for the professional but gets the job done for the most part
I have not spent tons of time working with the program yet, but have done enough to know that the learning curve is reasonable if you are somewhat publishing program literate. It has lots of potential for aiding in visualizing what your project will look like finished. If you are willing to invest some time to learn the program features, it performs as promised
I was a little skeptical about this program  - until I tried it last evening for the first time. I am really impressed.....  I did not even use the tutorial before I dove in and tried to play a bit.  I created a single room in less than 3 minutes, using simple walls, doors, windows, and a fireplace.  Adding flooring and coloured walls was so easy it was almost sinful!  LOLI am most anxious to do more with the program and learn about all its capabilities.  Today I watched the tutorial and was really surprised at how much this program can do!  I am entering into an interior design program in January 06 and wanted to "play" with the CAD software in advance.  I was really happy and impressed with the simplicity of the Better Homes and Gardens version as the idea of CAD seemed intimidating.  Not any more....I whole-heartedly recommend this program to everyone who is considering designing their interiors or for students of interior design who have not yet attempted any CAD programs. 
Was a fan of Nortons till after reading reviews and going onsite to check out this Anti-Virus package, it just has more to offer and less of a resource hog
Impressed with the way it clears out viruses, spyware, and Trojans---I can look at what it's doing or just let it do it. That all goes well. What I don't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign-me-in sites and I can't figure how to change this. So the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful
I tested numerous anti-virus programs after getting fed-up with previous Norton Anti-virus, which would always "hang" my incoming email, causing me to redownload larger files and sometimes make it impossible to retrieve them at all. (Incidentally, this had nothing to do with the "time-out" settings.) After testing other top rated anti-virus programs, the only one that wouldn't "hang" large email files, was Kaspersky. Even though I have my "time-out" set to only 1 minute, Kaspersky never stumbles and lets go, even if it takes much more than 1 minute to download.I also like the easy to use "pause protection" when I'm doing file clean-ups, because there's no sense passing temporary files through a second time, and it speeds the clean-up 5 times faster
I am not a computer geek or techie at all, most software and hardware changes always make me hold my breath and cross my fingers.  I recently purchased the Kaspersky Anti Virus based on the review of it in Consumers Reports.  It installed easily, updates automatically and frequently.  Very satisfied with it. 
I have got a virus that cause files "comment.htt" appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus. I tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective. So I try KAV and it works! Also KAV does not slow my computer like some big-named antivirus. Autoupdate feature is cool. We do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable
This is one program that in my opinion you get more than what you pay for I have several Immaging programs that I use for several different things. This one is a delight to use and does a great job taking most of the work off the user. Its a microsoft program that is very user friendly and easy to use. However you do have to be some what computer savy, (like know where to turn on the computer kind of thing) not like some of the 1 star comments that were made here by other folks. I would recomend it to all people that need a simple to use program. Its not what you pay for something its what you do with it after you get it
I run two websites using this program, easy learning curve, I recommend it to all my newbie friends that need a simple, workable program. Ignore the crittics, this is a nice program.Only wish in batch editing I could do multiple web page saves.
I like all the things you can do with this product.  Glad I purchased it
I highly recommend Microsoft Digitial Image Suite 10 and the free GIMP programs for ALL of your digital imaging needs!!!  (...)  DIS 10 should be out now..
Not sure how I got it, but I got a browser hijacker that adaware and spybot wouldn't get rid of.  On top of that I got a trojan that these programs and my avast antivirus wouldn't get rid of.  So out of desperation to do something quickly, I went to B.Buy and bought this for $40.  They didn't have a large selection, so I put down the money for it.  Imagine my  feeling when I saw it on amazon for $20.  Still this product works well.  It made me uninstall spybot, adaware, and  turn off my windows firewall to install it.  You can install it on 3 different computers, or it asked you to switch your license from one of them, should you install it a fourth time.  So you can install it more than 3 times, you jsut have to switch your lisenses..understand?  Product works very well and got rid of my problems.  You get updates for 1 year, and then you have to renew.  I think this is stupid personally, but its the Trend now days.  Its a rip...you pay $40 for spyware or virus protection and it should be good for more than a year.  Several annoying windows pop up from time to time asking me what I want it to do.  I wish there was some default user setting so the program could do it.  The firewall slows down your connection, but they all do.  I have 3MG DSL and my speed test are down around 1300K, so I've lost alot of bandwith.  I guess its worth the protection.  Before with spybot and adaware, the spyscans would typically find 25+ issues of spyware.  Now with Trend Micro, I find only 5 to 10 issues on my weekely scan.  So I'm happy with the product, except for my decrease in DSL speed
I have been using PC-Cillin after dumping McAfee following some lousy customer support with no issues. This new version I was very concerned after reading all of the reviews. It does seem to slow things a little on my AMD PC if I am running all of the options I can run but even with them it is tolerable. I am sure you would not want to run this on anything less but it does work and managing it has been simple.
I have used this anti-virus since 2000, I liked it then, and I love it now.If your the type of user that does not want to worry about your computer on the internet, this is for you.It can be a pain on older computers that have less RAM, but it still gets the job done. Now the cons, I had 3 experiences with customer service, and 2 were postitive, and 1 was negative. I'm not throwing the baby out with the bath water, although I wanted too.The woman was extremely rude, to the point that I contacted the corporate office.In the end I did renew my subscription.I had no idea how easy it is for exe programs, and the such to change settings on your computer allowing attacks. This software lets you know when your settings have changed as soon as they get changed.For 20.00 how can you go wrong!
Switched from Panda Anti-Virus to this one.  Great software, very sensitive settings.  It was quite aggrevating at first getting constantly interrupted in other programs to be told of various things going on.  Finally got each feature individually adjusted to settings I can live with, and it works great.  They could improve the filtration time (long) to analyze your computer (I only have a 40gig HD with about 20gig used) as it takes about 20-25 mins. to do the complete cleansing process.  However, first time I ran it after having run Panda for the last time, it caught 2 undetected trojans Panda missed.  It also isolated a hidden file trying to access the internet for "updates" that I still have not been able to identify, but it's zapped.  Overall, best I've seen so far, and you can install it on up to 3 computers from one cd (just name each installation with a different username to accomplish, all perfectly legal with the 3 User CD deal).  I have 3 laptops covered at a cost of about $13 each - I'll take that all day long
I was using CA but they dropped Zone Alarm and I was having issues.  PC-Cillin has my computer safe again.  I love that it is 3-user
No brainer.Easy to use.Good value.
My feelings are...if you have simple income, not a lot of financial dealings, this program will walk you thru your returns with no difficulty. I've only done Fed  State with 2 incomes, 1 home, with all the associated deductions and the program handled everything. Using the program is a snap and it saves me about $200-300 over using a tax preparer, who asks me questions just like this program does. You simply need to sort out all your receipts, etc., the same as you need to do for a live preparer
I read several reviews and was little hesitant to purchase this software.  I have a basic Hp all in one printer and so far the software is wonderful and easy to use.  I have really saved some time with this software. 
Produc in good condition, easy to use. Best price, comparing it whit other selling companies
I needed this for my new MacBook laptop that will give me Apple and Windows on the same machine.  The laptop works fine, the pocketbook is thinner.  You do what you have to do
Bought this primarily for my TIVO set, so I could transfer and burn DVD's from my  TIVO box. Once I hooked up my mac G5 to the TIVO box, Toast worked perfectly. Easy interface, fast transfer, easy to burn. It's nice to know that TIVO supports Mac. A great product!!
I love Toast, and have had it since version 3.  Don't have TiVO, so can't comment on usability, but for everything else it works better than software that comes with Mac.  Can't wait to try double-density and Blu-Ray, with which this is compatible.  Even earlier versions could burn more different kinds of media than the burn software that came with the Mac.  A friend of mine just switched from PC to Mac, and this was the first software that I suggested he buy.  As another reviewer said, if you have Toast, you don't need Popcorn.  The best!!
I was a little leary about purchasing this product, having never tried anything like it before and being fairly new to the computer world.  I was delighted to find how easily the Toast 8 system worked for me.  The owner's manual is VERY specific, and while I am still discovering all the capabilities of this software, I have found it to be extremely useful.  I recommend this product very highly
I am very excited about the additions to Toast 8.  I am still learning how to use all of them.  The connection with TiVo is one of the most exciting new items.  I have connected and reviewed Tivo recordings through Toast.  I have not had an opportunity to use toast for a DVD yet. 
The product works pretty much as advertised and I received it in a fairly timely manner
This product is great.  It is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording.  The addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner.  The only problem I have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd.  If you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need.  Don't wast time with anything else
This world renown editor is the best when it comes to editing and managing your digital photo
I purchased Elements because frankly,I couldn't afford the whole big Adobe enchilada.I have found it to be pretty intuitive.Lots and lots of options as to organization,photo-tweaking and such. I have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos.I do have two other imaging programs,and with the addition of Elements,I feel like I'm basically well-set with zillions of options.Plus,there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography,and they supply free downloads of Photoshop samples, such as "textures," and so on.Very helpful.Get this if you can't spring for the complete Photoshop program. You will not be disappointed
I used Adobe 3.0 for a long time and love it. Took the opportunity to upgrade and love the same things about 5.0. It's easy to use, easy to learn.  Great to use for just basic printing, easy to get more complicated if you want
I wanted to see if I could do all the essential digital image editing "on the cheap" in PSE5...and I am satisfied that I have been able to do just that.The best companion book I've seen to assist in that effort is this one:Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 Maximum Performance: Unleash the Hidden Performance of Elements by Mark Galer. The combination of the PSE5 software and book proved to be perfect for me, and as near as I can tell, I can now do all the image editing I need to do, at a fraction of the cost and time required for the full-on Photoshop product. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. If you're on the fence about it, I'd recommend downloading the 30 day trial version from the Adobe website prior to purchasing
I found Turbotax easy to use.  It gave me the flexibility of filling in individual forms rather than using the interview process.  Since I am an experienced tax preparer, I found this feature welcome
I've been manually doing my taxes for the last few years. They weren't hard as much as time consuming. Turbo Tax turned an all day project into just a couple of hour
Good product; however, I don't understand why it requires lengthy updates every time I open the program.  Perhaps they should try to get it right the first time.  And it's impossible to tell whether the updates do anything for me.Using it with Quicken is a PITA.It is unclear to me how you get more than one state
I had read a lot of reviews (here and elsewhere) warning of Final Cut's massive learning curve, and I do believe that helped soften the blow when I first tried this program. Because there definitely is a learning curve--this is far more complex than iMovie. But, the good news is, it's not beyond the newbie's reach!I'm such a newbie with anything video, it's pitiful. I have only made two or three small movies in iMovie, and they weren't very sophisticated. I mostly just tinkered around. But, being the fool that I am, I decided that I wanted to get Final Cut Express to go along with the new camcorder I had just purchased.Because I was prepared to have to re-learn (or struggle) at first with Final Cut, I had purchased a book (for version 2 of FCE, which was perfectly suitable). Armed with my book and limited expectations, I set about trying to make a fun little "music video" (using video clips and still pictures). Amazingly enough, I learned how to do the "Ken Burns Effect" with the pictures, make transitions from one clip to the next, edit the sound so that one track would predominate for part of the video, then fade out for other parts. And I was able to fix the video clips (zoom in, lighten, change aspect ratio). And then I added titles with LiveText. All this in the first two days of using Final Cut!  Sure, the little video I made was no award-winner, but it was actually a servicable, fun little project that I wasn't too ashamed to show my friends.(Another thing about fixing the aspect ratio of one of the video clips--there was this one clip that seemed resistent to any tweaking or adjusting that I tried with it. I had used multiple programs to try to resize it to the correct dimensions, but something always went wrong. Either the picture quality degraded terribly, or else the corrected dimensions didn't "stick" and it bounced back to being distorted. Nothing worked--until Final Cut. I'm sure that other programs could have done the same thing, but I tried so many, and failed. So that was another thing that impressed me!)I know there's a whole lot more to learn about Final Cut, and I certainly don't anticipate that I'll become a master at it. But it does offer *a lot* more flexibility than iMovie, and it is definitely a lot of fun. The right way to approach it is, I believe, to start small, expect baby steps at first, have fun, and GET A BOOK! A book is absolutely essential. If you are an impatient soul who expects perfection the first day, this is not the application for you. Because you learn to "do it manually," you have much more control--but it takes time to learn it all.Oh, a note about hardware: I made my first little video on a 1.25 GHz G4 Mac Mini with 512 megs of RAM. It wasn't a speed demon by any means, but because my video was short (about 2 minutes), it really wasn't too painfully slow most of the time (except for rendering, but I guess that was going to be slow anyway). I have since upgraded the Mini to 1 GB of RAM, and *everything* is snappier, so I highly recommend it. But it's good to know that even a little Mac Mini with less-than-impressive RAM can work in FCE.
This is a great program for your mac... I've used it in a film class the previous year and it took me a year to really get the hang of it. Because it has no tutorial I recomend you find someone who has used this and get them to give you a few lessons
OK, it is big (4 CDRs).  And a full install will require over 2.35 GB.  But it loads quickly and offers nice greeting card variety along with pretty sophisticated card customization options on all pages of the card.  As in previous years, it also installs Event Planner. If you don't want to use Event Planner you can stop it from starting with Windows by going to START / ALL PROGRAMS / Startup group and deleting the entry for Event Planner from the STARTUP group but if you don't have a similar program, you might find Event Planner to be useful.I found setting up this program for my auto-duplexing Ricoh color laser printer easy enough to do, so setting it up for other printers will likely be pretty easy also. The quality of the printed cards is really astounding, even my normally "picky" wife thinks they look very nice and acceptable for any use. I suppose your results could depend on your printer but if your printer currently prints nice graphics and pictures, then the cards should turn out very nice. I recommend using heavy card stock for a professional looking final product. Cards that default to printing out in the 1/4 sheet size (four fold) format can easily be printed at 1/2 fold size and the graphics and text remain outstanding. I never experimented with the "partial install" that would require disk swapping but save HD space, so I cannot if that would be a nuisance or not.  Overall, there is nothing I've found about the program that I don't like.    
I found WordPerfect to be much more intuitive than Microsoft Office. The reveal codes function has really eased many formating headaches and I love the automatic PDF maker
I have used WordPerfect and Quattro almost from their inception, so I have seen both of them improve over many years. Those years of practise have resulted in WordPerfect Office X3, a really outstanding product.Because many other organizations and people that I work with use MS Word and MS Excel, in the past I have had no choice but to grudingly use them in response. Now, however, WordPerfect and QuatroPro can translate Word and Excel, incoming and outgoing. Therefore, I no longer have to maintain two Office programs. Many years of using WP Office have probably prejudiced me, but I find it more user friendly than MS Office; however, the biggest difference is that Corel is responsive and helpful whereas MS is almost impossible to deal with
I like WordPerfect much better than Microsoft Word as it is easier to use.  Reviel codes solves a lot of problems when text wont behave. Not available in Word. I bought the X3 version because of some bad bugs in ver 12., like not being able to export my address book without errors and mail merge problems. The price was right on Amazon and it was easier that trying to fix 12. I don't see a big difference between the two versions except that they fixed all the problems that I was having in 12. If an earlier version is working for you, I see no good reason to upgrade.B
I installed it on three of my computers with no problem I have used wordperfect before and it's vey user friendly. I'm not a power user but the basic things seen be easier to do. I recomended. The software came with and intructional  dvd no how to used un like the microsoft counter part.this software is more then what is needed for the average person. it also comes with some free download for installing the software in your computer which you can install on all three computers. it come with lots of template that you can used.buy, buy, buy I say. lol is worth it
I've always preferred WordPerfect to Word.  I find it is easier to use, more intuitive, and allows more control over documents.  It is less buggy, and I have yet to find one thing that Word does better than WP.  This new version of WP is even better than the old, and I can use it more now because it seamlessly converts documents to and from Word.  Word users should find this version especially easy to switch to, since it can be made to look and act like Word (though why anyone would want that, I don't know).  Underneath the surface, though, it is still WP, which means it is stable, you can see codes in your document and manipulate them, and it won't do things like decide when you put a number somewhere that you are making a list and start indenting and doing other weird things you don't want and can't control.  I have been using WPX3 heavily since I got it, but I still haven't used all the features.  I am especially looking forward to trying its PDF conversion function.  I also haven't used any of the other programs in the suite yet, but if prior versions are any indicator, they will also be easy to use and powerful.
I've been using Wordperfect for about 25 years and it keeps getting better.  It is the best word processor by far.  So many things are better than Microsoft's word processors.  Importing graphics, mail labels, and especially reveal codes to name a few.
The new edition of W/P is simply the best.  The new features, the little extras you've come to expect from W/P, the user-friendly tool bars all make this a good investment
I remember the first time I used WordPerfect, and the first time I used Microsoft Word.  I couldn't imagine why anyone would choose the vastly inferior Word over WordPerfect.  Years passed, and now I find myself using MS Word every day.  I'd been ground down by the thousands of Word users who'd picked it up along with PowerPoint and Excel, and who didn't have enough savvy to know how to convert documents from one format to another.  WordPerfect _always_ converted MSWord docs.  MSWord never reciprocated.  Shouldn't that have told them which program had a mandate to make the customer's life that much easier?  With each successive iteration, WordPerfect introduced some new innovation, and in the next incarnation, Microsoft aped it.  It got to the point where users would nod appreciatively at the innovation, then wait the inevitable year-long interval for Microsoft to catch up, and then they'd buy that.Well, due to an outrageously fair price point and multiuser license, I tried WordPerfect X3, and it was like coming home.  It's nothing short of amazing.  I went out and bought a copy for my parents, and they love it, too.  Now my brother, an attorney, has asked me to buy him a copy, since so many of the federal prosecutors he works with have WordPerfect only, and can't seem to open his Word files.  The more things change, the more they stay the same
I find MS's Expression Web to be a huge step up for the professional web designer from FrontPage.  FrontPage 2003 was extremely nice and very usable by informal web developers, but the code view really wasn't much better than notepad (...not that I have a problem with notepad!).  [...]  I highly recommend it for the professional web designer
A good product but like a lot of Microsoft releases, not everyone outside of Microsoft is ready for it.  Check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with Expression Web.  That is a problem I have run into.  In fact some hosting services that support Front Page, haven't even come to full support of Front Page 2003 let alone Expression Web. You could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features
Great product! I have had a little experience with FrontPage, but this product is definitely not FrontPage with a new look. This is an easy to use yet professionally powerful tool for web page development. It goes way beyond my abilities. If Microsoft continues to develop this product the way it has started....then watch out DreamWeaver
Compared to FrontPage and its infamous "bots", Expressions Web is a refreshing piece of software from Microsoft that out-DreamWeavers DreamWeaver.  As a long time DreamWeaver user, the ability to easily stay in design mode in Expressions Web while building your user interface without the incredible futz-factor that DreamWeaver imposes is its greatest strength. This is a very impressive, stable product that I plan to use a great deal in my non-.net web development work. It makes building and maintaining pure html web sites and newsletters much easier and more intuitive than ever
I have been using FrontPage 2003 and decided that Web Expression Web was the next stage in my website building hobby.  It was easy to install, and I can still use FrontPage 2003 on my existing websites. No need for FrontPage extensions which will be a plus on one of the server hosts I use.  Also bought "Using Microsoft Expression Web" by Jim Cheshire. An excellent book.  Still have much to learn, but looks like fun
I had the software in just a couple days and it was exactly as I ordered. Along with it came an information sheet on what to do and who to contact if there were any problems. Great Job. Would order from them again
The only problem that I had,was loading the actual program on the three computers that I have.You had to delete your old Norton AntiVirus 2006 before starting.Also I have one more problem that after I loaded the Norton AntiVirus 2007 - 3 Users on the last computer I still get a error that I need to down load the latest updates,which I already did
This is the 3 copy version of Norton  AV.  (one CD will create three copies) I purchased it to save money as it was less than $20 per copy.  I bought it to replace NAV 2006 on the same three computers which had expired.Installed easily on two machines.  Just the uninstall of 2006 and the install of 2007.   The first machine was more difficult.   There is evidently some conflicting software on the computer as i had to use msconfig for a "Clean boot" per Norton web site instructions .  I kept running into the "blue screen of death" on the previous installs when i would get to the actual install of the Norton AV.  Each time i would have to uninstall the program and do more.   But all of the help came from the Symantec (norton) website.  It is now working fine.Added:My personal preference is to not use software firewalls.  I use a router with NAT as a hardware firewall. (It only blocks unauthorized incoming malware)  Software firewalls try to tell you about everything leaving your computer and generally you either become paranoid or just shut the thing off.   They are intended to look for malware by behavior.  Antivirus programs look for malware by signature.  The only advantage to finding malware by behavior is if the computer is attacked in the first day or two of the malware's existence.  If one has an antivirus program it will eventually (within a few days) find the problem that the software firewall was trying to tell someone about. (assuming they haven't given up yet with too many cries for wolf).So the only software firewall i have (Microsoft OS firewall) is turned off and thus i haven't had the same problem as others report. As a practice i sent junk email directly to the trash can and avoid weird websites.  So far no problems with malware.
I do television editing for my church and I dabble alittle at home. I have many editing programs that I use for music and video editing of home movies from cams and 8mm.I had nero 6 and it was ok, but nero7 ultra (enhanced) has taken the place of all the other programs. It is my primary editing suite for music and videos. for music I can make changes to songs for skating programs where I would have to send out to have words removed or create a cd for pleasure.This program is remarkable, there are still somethings I have not yet used, this was the best but in this type of program for under $800.00 that is how much the programs that we use in the studio starting price is. Buying this program will be a great investment.
The product did just what I wanted and that is to burn videos onto dvds from my camera.  I had an earlier version of Nero but it would not do this. 
Nero 7 the original version was useless in that it prevented you from burning some things; mysteriously Nero had suddenly undone itself. All of that has now changed with the new update. It is so good that you can now burn ANYTHING on Vista.Nero Inc also released a "Nero 7 cleantool" for removing bad installs. If you have had trouble with Nero 7 on Vista then the cleantool will fix it. Apply the tool. Clean install. Nero 7 is 99.9% effective but has a tendency to corrupt now again simply because it has a vast configuration system. Nero is a core burning tool. This means that several backup packages out there will actually find Nero on install and use it for burning. One example is DVDshrink that runs Nero in the background while backing up DVD movies on DVD-R. I/O errors with these programs, including DVD Decrypter, are usually the result of a configuration problem with Nero. One example is updating your firmware. Sometimes this requires you to reinstall Nero. This problem however is the only bug I have found with Nero. Just on the side - I highly recommend either Sony, Imation, Memorex, Verbatim as relatively cheap good second class media (80% or higher burn success rate). DVD is still in its early days of development and some media is garbage so don't blame Nero if you make coasters (half burned DVD-R Discs that are useless to you) with this software. I also recommend a healthy supply of at least 3 DVD-RW Discs for TESTING your burning so that you NEVER make a coaster and waste money. Okay, now back to Nero. Nero Burning Rom is the real tool in the bundle. It is the most configurable burning tool in the package while Nero Express is for those who do not know a thing about burning and works like a Wizard. A word of advice is to stick with the Rom and learn it without using the Wizard. You can choose from dozens of CD formats and dozens DVD formats, including several variations of each format. Image burning and hybrid discs of any time are all here. There is not a disc format you cannot burn with this program. Burner hardware based error correction systems in conjunction with the Nero software make a perfect burn almost every time. Nero also happens to be extremely fast, if not the fastest out there, however fast is also in terms of how fast your burner is, but the software package requires little to no processing before a 8GB DVD is being pulled onto your HD. You can create ISOs with Nero and even use Nero to open up ISOs so you can read the content). There is an amazing amount of free software out there that uses this burner as their base and rightly so. It is the best burning software out there at this time of writing. Pros: - If you can learn tutorials for all types of backups then this and a DVD burner will change your life if you play games and watch movies. - Solid performance. With good hardware and media almost flawless burns every time. - Nice configuration. Can even backup your PS and Xbox Games. - All burning formats. - About 266mb in size. Cons: - Let's face it. DVD burning and backup does have a bit of a learning curve. Read plenty of tutorials that use Nero to do specific backups. - Corrupts sometimes and needs cleaning before reinstall. - You really need a top of the range machine to backup a DVD in less than an hour
I previously had Nero 6 and it had tons of bugs for me. I upgraded to 7 ultra enhanced when I upgraded my computer to Vista premium, and I was pleasantly surprised. Everything I have tried so far has been flawless.It seems that different systems have different results with Nero. For example some people say Nero 6 works best for them, but on my old system it was horrible (running on win2k).It's complicated software though, so people should give Nero a break.Overall they do a great job. Just download the trial first and see how it runs on your system.
Great product, has more features then just CD/DVD burning, system backup, numerous audio recording, editing features, lightscribe and it's also Vista compatible. The only downside is it's learning curve some features and options are complex, but once mastered you will be more then pleased with this product. 
I used this unit to calibrate my Mitsubishi WD65732 DLP HD TV and was surprised at how good the picture looks after the adjustment. I first went through the tv manual to make sure I understood all the various adjustments the tv makes and wrote them down on a spreadsheet so I could study them and make sure I knew how the language related to the SpyderTV adjustment language. Once I did that and marked down the adjustment ranges, it was a breeze to run the software and make the adjustments. It even creates a pdf file at the conclusion for record purposes and future comparisons. Some of the adjustments for color temperature were surprising, but the bottom line is that the picture looks great
This thing is amazing.. My Plasma is like a whole new tv.. My 60" Sony SXRD paired with a PS3 is the best looking picture I have ever seen, after using the STV100. This is a must have
After going insane with the new version of Norton Systemworks 2005, which doesn't even install, I decided to finally swear off all Symantec products. I have used Zone Alarm Pro for some time. It's not perfect, but it certainly will protect your computer. I took the plunge and went with the full security suite this week, and I've been relatively happy.On the plus side, the software works really well. The personal firewall is better than any you can find, and the virus protection found a phishing app that Norton had not (before I had unstalled it).On the minus side, the firewall can be problematic. I've had page load issues on Ebay and on my own site which has a cgi script to keep my images and files from being hotlinked (bandwidth theft). When I visit my site or any other that has a similar anti-theft cgi script, the images simply won't come up. Ebay gets all messed up as well. I haven't been able to figure out a setting that works, so I have to turn off the firewall on Ebay and a few other sites, which kind of defeats the purpose of a firewall. This doesn't happen a lot though, so it's not annoying enough to get my dander up.All in all it's been a far better investment than Symantec products, so despite its limitations I would recommend this program. It does have a lot of options to set, but they are pretty easy to get through if you are computer literate.If you decide to go with this program and you currently have Norton Antivirus, you will need to uninstall Norton before this program will run.If you were to ask me if I preferred Symantec Systemworks or Zone Alarm Security Suite, there would be absolutely no hesitation in recommending Zone Alarm.
I liked the older version better, I hope to get use to the new version
You learn extremely fast using Rosetta stone, and you learn to think about what the word is, not it's translation. Probably the best language system available
Between high school and college I have studied French for three years and I had been convinced that I would starve to death in Paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood.  Much of that has changed not that I am half way through the Rosetta Stone program.  My ear is now tuned to the language. I have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses.  My vocabulary still needs to get stronger, but now that I can distinguish individual words in a stream of French, that is only a matter of practice with the language.  As advertised, this program is painless and progress is rapid.  Try the demo, you'll see.
The immersion process is the only one that works, and this product is a first rate immerser, making the study painless, even immensely pleasurable as one realizes he/she is coming to "own" a new language and perspective. In working with students it is the best "head start" method that I know of, comparable to one-on-one study for at least a year with an accomplished tutor. Unlike less effective methods, it quickly achieves the essential purpose of deeply internalizing the language if one does each of the processes thoroughly. Of course continued study, especially in acquiring vocabulary, is necessary, just as it is for those acquiring a native language - the study of any language is ongoing.I would give this program 50 stars if that option were available. 
I discovered my MS Office had a bug in it, and came that way from the factroy.  I looked Word over and it was clean.  Then the program itself.  It does everything and well, and it does it without the tracking bug on it
If you look at my review history, you may note that I've given very few five-star reviews. I save five stars for outstanding products. I believe Wordperfect X3 is best described as outstanding.A long time ago, I used Word Perfect. However, my earlier jobs required I use MS Word, so I did my best to become a Word guru. I believe I accomplished that short of creating custom macros. As a law clerk, I started a new job where WordPerfect was the standard.So, last year I bought WordPerfect 12. At first it was difficult, but I bought a book that helped me fill in the blanks. With the ability to customize keyboards and the fact that WordPerfect gives the author a great degree of control (especially with show-codes), I was soon able to become a WordPerfect guru. I remembered all the things I used to love about WordPerfect. Like any lover, I also learned to ignore some of the blimishes of WordPerfect. (One of those blemishes is the behavior of pushing a change from that point of the document forward, which, once you get accustomed to it, is really a nice feature.) Wordperfect and PDFs are the two accepted file formats for electronic submission to Federal courts.There were two complaints I found at work among Word devotees: 1) the ability to export to PDF but not import and 2) the inability to cut from a Word document into a WordPerfect document without creating all the formatting litter Word likes to use.1. We occasionally receive PDFs that we would have to retype to be able to make edits. With the ability to import PDFs (that is, those that were authored and exported into PDF, not documents scanned into PDF), we were now able to edit those PDFs. This was a real time saver. Since PDF is the de facto universal standard amongst all platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix), this was a great improvement.2. Formatting litter is a real pain to deal with. I never could get a MS Word document to just import into WordPerfect without headaches in trying to fix the formatting. My solution was to copy the portion out of MS Word, paste into a text file, copy again and then paste into WordPerfect. My complaint was I could not just straight paste into WordPerfect. Well, Corel heard my cry and provided the ability to copy just the text. The lone MS Word holdout in my office capitulated with that. He has no more to complain about.Another great thing about WordPerfect is the fact that the file format for its documents has not changed in years (I heard a WP rep say no change since 1995). Why should it? Everything you could want to do in a document (perhaps barring professional typesetting) can be done in WordPerfect. There's no need to create a new format when the one you have just works.This product does exactly what those who have come to love WP expect it to do. I think Corel has done a good job of resolving my own personal quibbles with WP.So, if you're looking for a solid performer that seeks to beat competition by improving itself, WPX3 is representative of what you're looking for
Overall I would highly recommend the Rosetta Stone software even though it's a bit over priced and certainly insufficient as your primary learning method.  Rosetta Stone *combined* with Pimsleur is a great method for languages that are similar to your native language.  The disks are copy protected and that is a serious drawback as you need the CD in the drive any time you are going to use it and you can't use a backup copy for safety.The Rosetta Stone lessons are quick, easy and fun to do, thus encouraging usage.  If you can afford it I would definitely recommend combining Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone.  Both are excellent products and far better than less expensive products commonly available.  But neither alone is sufficient for effective learning of a language.Could Rosetta Stone be improved?  Certainly.  More diverse and better graphics would help.  The graphics they use are very good but occasionally a picture isn't quite clear as to meaning.  For example if you are supposed to select "a boy on a horse" you may not realize it is a boy on the horse.If you are questioning if you should get Rosetta Stone or not, just get a free demo CD from their website and try it yourself.  As far as I can tell the full product is exactly the same as the demo but obviously you have access to more lessons
I purchased this program about 1.5 years ago. I have been casually studying German through other programs for about 4 years. The best basic words-only is through Unforgettable Languages (very basic, but easy as heck to learn). Rosetta Stone is the best for understanding gender, verb usage and adapting to the German style of sentence structure. I absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program. It is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking. The only negative is that the CD has to be used to run the program. Even with an accelerated CD-Rom, the starting/stopping of the CD is distracting. If that feature were corrected, it would be perfect
This is actually a review for more than one product (Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone)If you are willing to spend 1-2 years learning a foreign language but have limited time (weekly), lack the ability to immerse yourself in that culture for 1 year (the best way to learn the language), can't attend classes, can expend some budget, and want the process to be challenging yet fun, here's how to do it:1. Buy a good English-Foreign Language Dictionary.2. Get the Pimsleur Course for that language. (Check Ebay for used copies)3. Buy the Rosetta Stone Program for that language. (Costly. Try the online monthly subscription option if your budget is tight.)4. Get a Basic Grammar Language Book (Barron's highly recommended)Putting it all together.1. Listen to the Pimsleur Program during your daily commute-1 lesson per day. (Take the weekend off) DO NOT go to the next lesson until you have a 80% recall of the material. THERE IS NO NEED TO BE AT 100% RECALL before going to the next lesson. (Trust me on this on-avoid my pain)      Using this method, you can get through ALL Pimsleur lessons (Levels I-III)in 1 year. THE FOCUS OF PIMSLEUR IS SPEAKING SKILLS.2. At the same time, use the Rosetta Stone lessons on the weekend, with one 30 minute to 1 hour session. Go through the guided exercise followed by the test. THERE IS NO NEED TO GO THROUGH EVERY LESSON (TYPE) for each program. After you buy the product, you'll know what I'm talking about. THE FOCUS OF ROSETTA STONE IS LISTENING SKILLS.  3. Review the basic grammar of the language as you go through the 2 above.4. Contrary to what Pimsleur says, look up any words for spelling, and likewise, for Rosetta Stone, look up any words for definition you don't understand. Bottomline: Despite what they advertise, these are not stand-alone programs. Also the secret to recall is anticipation, meaning an 80% success rate for Pimsleur is ok and 70% success rate for Rosetta Stone is okay before moving to the next lesson. You don't get any extra points for making 100% and this effort can be counter-productive (burn out, boredom, and frustration before finishing the lessons.)Your goal should be to get through all of the programs and lessons and the experience should be challenging and fun. Afterwards, you can take your trip to that country for the total immersion experience, and after the first 2 weeks, you'll see how well spent your time was with the programs.  Note: I've used the Japanese, German, and Korean Pimsleur Courses, and Rosetta Stone German and Japanese Programs. I've also spent extensive time in all 3 of those countries. Learn from my mistakes.Good luck and have fun.
Overall I was pleased with ease of installation. This was an upgrade from Office 2003. I backed up all files before upgrade, and always do this, but it was not necessary for this upgrade. My overall disappointment is Outlook's inability or difficulty to use other mail servers (yahoo, gmail, etc.). The shift appears to favor msn products only (hotmail and msn). No wonder Thunderbird is slowly becoming a favored email application
It seems the last few Office releases I have purchased haven't really offered anything different, but this one does.  The interface is totally changed and takes some getting used to.  I would suggest upgrading to Office 2007 when you have a little time to figure out the new layout and not if you have to jump right into a project.  The new toolbars seem to be really thought out and are very user friendly.  If you aren't into change and prefer the status quo of the standard, File Edit Tools...layout, then this product is not for you.  If you are willing to spend a couple hours getting used the new layout (it's quite easy) you won't be sorry because it's well worth it. 
I upgraded form Office 2000 to Office 2007, expecting to see major improvements. I was disappointed. Office 2007 has some enhancements, but it also has some glitches. If I had been able to try it first, I probably would have just stuck with my old version of Office
Office 2007 is a nice step up from Office 2003 (and earlier) as it has better visuals on the toolbar. e.g. Instead of just seeing the worded commands on the toolbar where one clicks on the command and then gets a drop down list to choose from with more commands, i.e. File, Tools, Edit, etc, you'll see tabs with different commands on the toolbar. When clicking on the tabs, it sets up across the toolbar, all of the functions of that particular tab. Once viewed, you not only see the words of the functions, but also, small example graphs and images of what that functions does. This only applies to all the applications other than Outlook, which pretty much retained the same look and feel as 2003The load times seem to be much quicker than what I had in the 2003 version. In Outlook, setting up accounts, maintaining names and addresses is much easier too. The only annoying part of Office 2007 that comes to mind is, one can only choose from 3 color schemes. The three are "Black" which really looks more like a dark taupe or slate color, "Blue" which looks more like a light powder blue and "Silver", which looks like a light gray. In my honest opinion, I like having the standard color look like previous versions and as my taste goes with this, I only like the black setup only
I notice with gratitude that Symantec has removed many glitches from NAV.Installation is now faster and smoother. The program is running well in the background, updating itself and sending notifications of any attention it needs
This is a great product.  It easily performs all the functions a small business needs, if it is to be taken seriously in the marketplace.  I'm impressed at how seamless it integrates all the accounting functions.  Essentially, you never enter information more than once and it always anticipates the most logical next step.  My clients are impressed at receiving e-mailed estimates and invoices that are clear, timely and professional.  This is a must
QuickBooks is an incredible product. If you have never used it before try having someone walk you through it
I find this product, easy to implement, train users, and monitor,manage any small business
This software is perfect for what I needed.  It allows my to keep my books without relying on an Accountant
You will save a lot of time by using this OCR. Top notch accuracy and very easy to use. A must for all those who need an OCR. Don't hesitate
Sept 15th, 2005I bought this for my god-daughter after buying Mia's Science Adventure. I have never been so impressed with a companies product before. You can learn both Spanish AND French on the same CD. The graphics are amazing, the adventure is stupendous and now Lily (my god-daughter) is learning Spanish. Her level is above all her classmates and she's even started conversing with a Mexican girl in our neighbourhood. Well worth your money
This game is great!  After buying Mia Reading I thought it was a great idea to get my 2 girls to start learning Spanish since we live in a global village. They game was easy to load, easy to navigate and the level was perfect for beginners. The high quality 3D animation will blow you away. Even my husband who learned 3D animation at the Vancouver Film School was blown away. The best part is, that they love playing it as they think it is a game. They forget they're learning numbers and vocab and how to put together simple sentences. Well recommended
I have been using NSW 2006 for a year and it's never failed me. I've always used Symantec products and have always been satisfied.
I have had this only a couple of days and have learned it quickly thanks to the training CD that is included with the program.Very easy to learn. Great item.3/23/07,I have used this program every day and must say I love it. I have used other photo editing software and did not like them much. This is so easy to use, the training CD gets you started and after compleing it (7 chapters) you are ready to fix all the photos you like but are over or under exposed. A powerful program. You can look like a pro using this. 10 stars if I could
Before purchasing this product I did the trial of Photoshop for 30 days and then the trial of this one.  Paint Shop Pro (PSP) won hands down!  While they both have similar features, the learning curve on Photoshop is ridiculous...PSP is so intuitive, you can figure out most of the features on your won, but the help feature is great...side by side help as you click through the menus and buttons.  I was impressed!  The red-eye fix is excellent and flexible, with ability to change to pet eye, different eye colors, WOW, there is just so much and all ready to use out of the box without any complicated aftermarket manuals needed.   I have restored some antique photos with very impressive results.  So far I have not had the instability issues that others cite, but my PC is heavy on the graphics capability and memory, perhaps that helps.
This photo editing software package is unreal.  It has more features and functions than you can shake a stick at.  Right out of the box I began some serious photo editing and got outstanding results.  Beats any other software in it's price range.  I have yet to read the manual or instructions as it intuitive.  Two things - don't even bother with the free version of Snapfire, which is included.  It is redundant with Pro Photo and rather simplistic without much value.  It is included as a teaser to get you to spend more money with Corel by way of an upgraded version.  And unfortunately the software is NOT well behaved and crashes to frequently.  If it were not for this stability issue I would have given it a (5) star rating.  Corel - nice job but get it working better
Like many other long term hobby digital photo fans I have used Paint Shop Pro for more than 10 years from version 4. It has always been a frustration that the programme was written for creating paint type graphics and photos were almost an add on. As Digital photography became more and more a real option the earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro became more of a frustration and I tried everything else. At last Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo feels like it was written for photo editing. It is easy to use with all the assistance a beginner could want, but dig deeper and it will go wherever you want to go, and more. I'm sad to see Paint Shop Album almost redundant, but it is great to have the organiser on tap. It runs on a less than optimal computer system unlike others that are too large and slow for many of us to consider.
I used Paint Shop Pro to help build my website. I really like it and I'm glad I bought it. My favorite part about it is the animation software. You can do great animation or cool banners or even little buttons with cool effects. Because of PSP 9 my website now has animation, buttons and a banner with bright colors and images! I love it! And anyone can use it! I had no experience with PSP or computer art and graphics, but this is pretty simple to use.Also you can use PSP for touching up and doing other neat things with your photographs. This is great software for doing all this stuff and it's so much cheaper than Photoshop. If you're building a website and want to add color and graphics or if you want do to some photo touch up work, then maybe you want to check out Paint Shop Pro
This is truly the killer application for comic book collectors.  You get the comic's whole run from its auspicious origins in 1961 to its current incarnation at the end of 2004, in a tiny DVD that you can carry anywhere.  The thrill of reading classical issues in all their colored glory is not to be missed, particularly for those not reprinted so far.  I especially enjoyed the Impossible Man and Molecule Man origin stories.  Seeing how particular adventures ended is also great fun, since I owned some comics from the generally undistinguished 1980s, but didn't know how things turned out.  Being able to read the entire John Byrne run of the mid-eighties was spectacular.  It's even better than his work at the X-Men, and almost as cool as the Lee-Kirby years.  This is so much better than the Essentials, since it's in color and so much cheaper, plus it includes the original ads and letter pages.  It also beats the Masterworks series not only on account of price, but also because it has the original colors.  It's as good as owning the complete collection, but it will take up less space and hence will generate less nagging from mothers or wives.  This is a must have item, with perhaps the best price/quality ratio I have ever seen.  Can it be improved?  Sure.  Why not take advantage of the possibilities of computers and create an index of all characters that would allow the reader to see all appearances of a character over the years? Why not create an index of writers and artists, so that one may quickly get a view of their work?  Cross-referencing is the next step the good people at Marvel must be working on.  But there's no reason to wait for that.  Even as it is, this DVD is not just good enough.  It is great, like the Fantastic Four themselves
An Excellent item saved me lots of time and money
This is absolutely tremendous!  If you ever owned the original Kirby-Lee Fantastic Four comics, and let them go for whatever reasons, or if you never had them, and want to see the World's Greatest Comic Magazine in the days when it truly lived up to that title, this is the way to go!  No one who's gotten this far should pass it up... it's an unbelievable bargain and a wonderful item in these days of madness like comics slabbed in plastic, like Han Solo trapped in carbonite...Forget the Marvel Masterworks volumes... the reproduction ranges from shoddy to terrible, and the color is garish.  Those reprints do a great disservice to these classic comics... the originals looked much better than they do in the Masterworks volumes!  An example... Fantastic Four #5... in the Masterworks volume, on the very first page of the very first appearance of Doctor Doom, black splotches inexplicably obliterate most of Doom's mask...there's no excuse for that! That wasn't there in the original, and it's not here in the scan!  If you don't own the original comics, and aren't wealthy enough to buy the originals, this is the way to go.  The scans are very good, high resolution.  Here, you see all the linework that gets clotted in the Masterworks volumes, and you can zoom in and really study all the details of that great Kirby machinery, otherworldly architecture, and cosmic panoramas!  I've had a big grin on my face from the moment I looked at the first page... this is what comics are all about... pure, unadulterated, cosmic fun!The original letter pages and ads are a real treat, too... the whole experience is time travel!Oh, yeah... you also get 34 years of non-Kirby Fantastic Four issues... ;-)Please note!  If you have a Mac, and are having difficulties with this dvd, here are some tips.Are you opening it with Preview?  If you just click on the icon on the disk, it will open in Preview... but this will not work properly.  You must use Adobe Reader to see the pages without the watermark.Install Adobe Reader from the dvd.Make an alias of Adobe Reader and put it in the Dock.Click and open the dvd icon.Click and open the decade folder.Don't open the year folder... click and drag the pdf icon, (such as FF_1960.pdf), onto the Reader alias in the dock to open.Click on year.Click on month.Click on the magnifing glass icon to zoom to any size.Enjoy all that cool Kirby machinery bigger than you've ever seen it!I hope this is helpful
Snapfire and Snapfire Plus are new photo software from Corel. Snapfire was recently released as a free download and Snapfire Plus is a budget priced upgrade which adds more advanced features.The one thing consumers ask for the most is a photo software that is easy to learn and use. Corel's answer is Snapfire's Message Center. From this one window, you can keep up with the latest news, updates and specials. More importantly, you have easy access to many tips and tutorials.Snapfire has automated photo downloading from your camera, memory card or CD. Just plug in one of these and the Photo Downloader automatically starts. You can set download options for how it works. Snapfire will automatically rotate your photos when needed, check for and download only the photos added since the last download and automatically delete the photos from your camera after downloading them to the folder of your choice on your hard drive.Once your photos are downloaded, you can use Quick Review to view photos in full screen mode and use the floating toolbar for tasks such as adding photo information, ratings and captions or starting Photo Fix. Snapfire's Photo Doctor analyzes your photos and makes suggestions for Quick Fix. With Photo Fix, you can pan, zoom and make corrections such as brightness, contrast and focus. Other photo adjustment features, which are similar to those included in Corel's popular Paint Shop Pro, include Fix Red Eye, Rotate and Crop (with a floating toolbar). Other features borrowed from Paint Shop Pro include easy-to-use organizing with Sort by, Search and Calendar Search. Snapfire also has ways to enhance your photos including Black  White and Sepia color effects.The Photo Tray is a really nice feature which you can use to drag and drop your photos into a common location, grouping them together for a project, emailing to family and friends or printing. Snapfire has a really cool and special way to email photos. Its called Snapfire Show. After you select the photos you wish to send, Snapfire will automatically create a slide-show with built-in transitions, music and motion effects. Your photos are resized and embedded into the body of the email or added as an attachment.Printing your photos is easy and fool-proof with the built-in layouts including standard 4 x 6, 5 x 7, 8 x 10, 3.5 x 5, wallet size and contact sheets. Snapfire will automatically use your default printer settings or you can change the settings or printer as needed. If you choose to order prints online instead, you can do so with one click of your mouse and the Photo Upload dialog box.You can also use Snapfire to work with your videos. Just click on a video's thumbnail to view and edit the video in full screen mode. You can even grab a frame from your video and convert it into a photo. For crafters, Snapfire has several built-in project templates for album pages, greeting cards, calendars and collages. Creating a project is as easy as dragging your photos onto the template and using the basic tools to make adjustments, add text captions and position photos.A trial version of Snapfire Plus (SE) comes packaged with the newest upgrade of Paint Shop Pro Photo XI or can be downloaded from the Corel website
It is user friendly, transparent, and more robust than Trendmicro's or CA's products, both of which slowed my computer and prevented my music websites from working.  For Windows OSes, Onecare is best in my experience.  However, I have not used OneCare's backup feature enough to make  a judgement.  The $49.99 for 3 computers may be okay, but it would be even better if Microsoft offers it for one computer at  1/3 the rate, say at $17/computer per year
Silent and reliable protection at a bargain price. Simple interface, not like those other fragmented bundles of freeware utilities.
I am still under the free 3 month trial period and love it.  I will buy it because it doesn't eat my memory and I feel safe with the people who designed the operating system.I reccomend
wow, this really made a difference in my ability to create professional-looking comics. i have a graphics tablet and the drawing feel is  really good. i think my favorite feature is the tool for making Panels. Plus the tool for doing special effects lines, which is pretty sweet.i just draw comics for fun, and for this price it is totally worth it. Manga Studio is perfect for publishing a webcomic or adding effects to existing drawings.I would definitely recommend this software if you like to draw comics or manga
I purchased the mangadebut because i wanted to dabble in tones and inking (which I usually never do, usually I just scan in the sketch and then darken it with a photo editing.) I came to find out that using lines and erasing the sketch makes for a much more clean finished product. Of course, you could acomplish this with MS Paint if you really wanted to. One of the main (and only, in my opinion) advantages to this program is the amazingly vast variations of tones available to make your art more interesting. that alone makes it worth the 50 dollars you put into it.One downside is that this program, because of it's many tones, uses and requires quite a bit of space. When I uploaded it on my laptop,it slowed down significantly. So much so that now I load it when I want to finish a nice drawing and the delete it from the computer again! XDoverall it deserves about 3-4 stars. ^.^
This unit works well, the software is a little hinky. It does not explain when to attach the spyder, but if you keep going back you can figure it out. Other than that I am satisfied.
Excellent for the novice. I callibrated three monitors with the spider. Prior to calibration the images were completely different from each other - after I was amazed how close the images were to each other. The process is so simple that even a cave man could do it.
I love this product. It is easy to use and lots of designs to chosse from
Creating Keepsakes Scrapbook Designer Version 2 Deluxe - This seems to be a nice program, but I have not found much use for it as of yet.  My intention, when buying it, was to use it for scrapbooking but also greeting cards.  I am sure that I will use it in the future as the program has nice graphics and is easy to navigate.  Broederbund products are usually very user friendly
For anybody who needs the full power of Acrobat, this is the way to go.  Highly recommende
Product was exactly as advertised and arrived in excellent condition
I've been using Acrobat Pro since version 3.0.  This is by far the best user interface of any version.  Also like the new tool to combine multiple files into a single PDF.  No support for Office 2007 docs yet, but I understand from Adobe there will be a free patch soon
I've used PaperPort 9 for about 3 years, currently running under Win XP. I love it, my wife loves it, I have bought it for my kids, and recommend it to others. A lawyer friend of mine raves about it. I've had no problems with it. (I had to  downlaod and install an upgrade, but more recent production probably has the upgrade already incorporated.) I download bank and credit card statements and other documents to it from the Internet; I store faxed documents in it; I scan checks before I deposit them; I use it to convert documents to pdf so I can e-mail them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish it were more convenient to do a couple of things; maybe V. 10 adds those features, but for the money, V.9 is a bargain. I just wish I had a faster scanner (what do you expect for $60?) so I could get rid of more paper documents. Highly recommended as a start toward the paperless office
Works well most (95%) of the time.  Slight improvement over v8
I'm an old school comic book collectors and I bought this in order to see what the technology has done with the print page.  This is more about collecting the stories than it is about collecting the art--and I still find there's no substitute for the feel of those magical pages
It's amazing having the entire history of a comic series at your disposal.  In print format, it would be impossible for most people to own, let alone store, this much comic book history.  You have to adjust to looking at the comics on the screen, rather than holding it in your hands (a large monitor helps), but other than that I highly recommend this entire series of digitized comics.To be able to go back in time and see how the comics reflect the times, whether they be in the 60's, 70's or more recent years, really shows you how closely comic books reflect pop culture
If you have a Mac, and are having difficulties with this dvd, here are some tips.Are you opening it with Preview?  If you just click on the icon on the disk, it will open in Preview... but this will not work properly.  You must use Adobe Reader to see the pages without the watermark.Install Adobe Reader from the dvd.Make an alias of Adobe Reader and put it in the Dock.Click and open the dvd icon.Click and open the decade folder.Don't open the year folder... click and drag the pdf icon, (such as FF_1960.pdf... I have the Fantastic Four dvd, so substitute whatever is appropriate), onto the Reader alias in the dock to open.Click on year.Click on month.Click on the magnifing glass icon to zoom to any size.I hope this is helpful
The content gives you 40 years of comic reading for a fraction of the price. However, some of the years can't be opened. Tried contacting the seller but to no avail. :
It is great to be able to read all the avenger comics again. I read them as a kid, but didn't get to read the very beginning. I hope that they bring out more of the comic book characters on DVD. I will buy more
When I was a kid, I religiously read many of the Marvel comics. The Avengers was one of my favorites. In my dreams I would have loved to have read all of the issues, but the expense would have been (WAY) too much. Now, after so many years the opportunity is finally here. I was afraid that my youth would be too far removed to enjoy reading these anymore, but I took a chance and bought this DVD anyway. It was worth it - by a mile. I am enjoying reading each and every issue since the famed #1 as much as I would have as a kid. It will take a long time to get through them all, but I'll enjoy every minute. Stan Lee, thank you for such a simple pleasure. Great stuff for kids of all ages
Ok I gave it 4 stars just for the fact that you cant actually hold them in your hands and read them . I do have them on my laptop so I guess that kinda works. Whats great about it is the price. 30 bucks for 40 years of comics.....get real!!! I did have some install problems at first like others have but when I took the disc out and reloaded it it fixed itself. I think it was a Adobe update but it did it for me so no biggie. My only problem now is when am I going to find time to read all of the issues. Oh and one more thing you can save the disc to your hard drive so you can save it at work and read at lunch without having to bring the disc with you. Highly recomended if you love comics
We bought it 1 month ago to help my almost 6 year's old sun to learn how to play because I didn't know how to play and I couldn't teach him. As a result of this purchase 1) My sun fall in love with chess and become so good player that I couldn't imagine2) I (his mom) learned how to play too.It is so much fun to learn it that I would recommend it to anybody. It worth it every penny I spent. I like everything about this game. Kids will love it 100%.
We purchased this for my 6 year old son and 7 year old daughter since both children have been asking me to help teach them how to play chess the last several months.  While I have been able to get them started, I find that approach used in this software to introduce the game pieces and concepts has allowed their understanding of the game to grow.Both kids enjoy using this software and, if I would let them, would spend hours at a time using the software.My biggest issue with the software is the  sound and animation.  We continually have issues with the sound/animation not being in sync or the audio cutting in and out.  We run this on a computer with plenty of processing power, memory, disk space, etc.  It does not bother this kids too much, but I find it annoying.All in all, a great tool to help my children learn the game.
This is my first review but I just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program. I bought this game when my children were in Kindergarten and second grade. Fritz and Chester's program is so engaging. There are rhymes and chants for each piece's moves as well as for some other "strategy-type" moves. For example, "A knight on the rim is ugly and dim." What a great way to teach kids to keep their knights in-play! This program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies. I would recommend getting Fritz and Chester 2 now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play! My boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade. Their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments. Fritz and Chester 2 is also great and my boys, now in third and sixth grade, still play it
This software is focused on learning the rules of the game.  Movement of different pieces and pawns is demonstrated through an assortment of arcade-type games.  There are some decent books for learning chess for beginners, but learning through a computer game program makes it much easier and more fun.The program doesn't contain any instructions,so some people may find it frustrating figuring out what to do in the beginning. However, there is a symbol in the top right corner, clicking on which brings down the menu at which point navigating becomes a piece of cake.Just knowing the rules of the game enables one to play chess, but not exactly to win, so the second CD in this series (Learn to Play Chess 2) continues where the first one left off and goes into different tactics and strategies.  The software is recommended for 8 year-old children and older - kids at heart may have fun learning chess with this program also
I am a chess player myself, so I can endorse this even more. This software is well designed, it can get a little difficult to get to some exercises inside it, but kids can figure it out eventually. My son has improved his play quite a bit even though he takes hints sometimes :), but this is a good software to get the kids started and teach them all the requisite skills to become a chess playe

Registry mechanic is a great registry tool.  It works better than the registry tools included with Symantec System Works.  If you purchase this version at 5.1 you can get a free upgrade to the latest version 6.0 once you register the product.  Try the evaluation and you will see how many registry errors your machine may have that can effect its performance
okay for  the time being but not enough . Needs to be combined with system mechanic for optimum capacit
Registry Mechanic by PC Tools is an absolute must for managing one of the gray areas of Windows.  Easy to use.  Immediate boost in speed. Great price. A "must have". 5 stars.FDR
I bought the datapilot universal pro kit recently and it worked great! My screen broke on my nokia 6102, and i ended up buying a razor. I had some really important numbers on that phone and this program really saved me. Transferred all my numbers from my broken one into my new razor in a couple of minutes. Also, the image editor and the ringtone thingy came in very useful for saving images and sending mp3s to my phone.
I have been using Tax Cut for five years.  It is quite easy to use and generally well documented.  I would like to see a better ability to select individual forms for printing
The software is easy to install and easy to use.  The "import prior year's return" feature saved time in completing multiple returns .  I completed one return in 10 mins because of this feature. I also discovered the "save as PDF" feature that made it easier to send tax returns to family and friends whom I prepare returns.  I have used tax cut for the last 4 years and it gets better with each year. The premium federal is great for multiple returns with all kinds of schedules
Have used Taxcut for years and this version does not disappoint.  The import of previous year data worked well and my tax return was quickly prepared
This Bible is wonderful! It's written in language that is easy to understand. Many people give up on trying to study the Bible because the language is so different from the way we speak now. You won't have that problem with the New Living Translation, and the notes are so helpful. Whenever I'm unclear about a verse or the context, I check the notes, and usually they help me to understand the meaning. They also help me to understand traditions of the time and meanings that were implied to the readers of the time. Whether you've been a Christian for 50 years, or you're only thinking of trying to read the Bible for the first time, or you're anywhere in between, this Bible is a great choice
I'm just learning, and this bible is wonderful. It's written in language I can understand (much easier than the King James version), and the commentary brings everything into focus. There is so much extra information in this book and the commenters really took care to try to explain so a newbie like me could understand.The book comes with a concordence also, which is a God-send (sorry about the pun). I've been so engrossed in reading that I haven't even looked at the CD-ROM yet, but I'm sure it will have great information also.If you want an easy-to-read bible that comes with fantastic study material, this is the right book for you
This study bible is absolutely wonderful if you are ready to dig deeper.  You could literally spend hours on a single chapte
NOTICE, YOU NEED AT LEAST 2GB RAM NOT 1GB AND VISTA IT IS FOR YOU!
This is a well done operating system I use the 64bit version and all but just a few of my software titles work without any problems. All my hardware has 64bit drivers. Overall this is a good product and I would buy it again. Because I went from a 32bit O/S to a 64bit O/S I had to boot from the DVD to install it, but I was able to install it using the key without any problems nor did I have to reinstall it afterwards as some website suggest you have to do
I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around.I have a Core 2 Duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5Ghz, 2 gigs of ram, a Geforce 7600gt and a Western Digital Raptor 150g HD and Vista Ultimate works flawlessly on my computer. It's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly, I built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net. I play World of Warcraft among some other games and I haven't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software I use as of yet. I've only encountered one problem and that was with my old Soundblaster Live! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support. No big deal, it was about time to get a better one anyway. Vista is awesome, I love everything about it. It's very futuristic and it is not a simple interface makeover at all like some clueless dummies proclaim.By the way, I only paid $110 for Vista Ultimate Upgrade off eBay, check there first if you already have an existing OS and want to save some dough
Aside from the typical minor quarks, this is overall a good product.  I've been using Turbo Tax for many years and it seems to work for me
Solid, familiar and dependable.  Although, I wish there was an option to only update the specific income information from the prior year without going through the extensive interview
This is a pretty good product for the price! I've found a few errors on location of addresses, but all in all, pretty good! Just wish Microsoft will offer a commercial vehicle version sometime in the near future. So far, we've had no complaints.
I use Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 in a laptop computer for navigational assistance anytime I'm traveling to a destination where I'm not absolutely certain how to get there.  In general, I'm pleased with it's performance.  It has saved me from wrong turns many times.  However, the data seems to be as much as five years out of date on many street additions.  GPS tracking on country roads is inaccurate enough to cause constant "Off Route" - "Back on Route" messages as you navigate twists and turns.  I suspect, in that case,  the map data is just not that accurate
I've been using Streets  Trips for years. I'm a real estate broker and use it every day. great product. Not as up-to-date as yahoo maps but easier and faster to use, particularly the route planner, gps, live local links, etc
This is still the best one out there, but this new version (been getting yearly updates since 1998) adds very little. Finally updated a couple streets in our area, so that alone was worth it
Don't listen to the whinnier. If you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills, this helps. You must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money. It is worth the effort! I noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work. I also purchased the music CD's produced by the same company. They are helpful as well. I use them at work, at home, and in the car. The Brain Builder Booklet mentions the CD's. If you want to stop looking stupid because you can't remember information or you're tired of getting lost while driving, this will help you
I don't write reviews often but this product is so great I had to share my thoughts on it.  I bought this product because I was going back to graduate school(mechanical engineering so please excuse my grammar) and I wanted an extra boost in brain power.  I have been using this product just about everyday for weeks now and the results are very apparent.  I have noticed two obvious improvements in myself.  First, I can now navigate a city with ease.  I always knew my short term memory was the limiting factor in my navigation abilities.  Before I'd always forget where I came from, left or right,what street Im on, etc.  I always had people correct me.  Now I am the one leading and its not because I am paying more attention.  Without directly thinking of my orientation I just know where to orient myself(My gf would always correct me, but now Im correcting her).   The second obvious improvement is my improved speech and listening abilities.  I'd always have trouble fumbling in my speech and understanding people.  But now I feel I can think of what to say more quickly and clearly.  I have been doing many puzzles this past summer and the combination of that and brain builder really changed my life.  I think more clearly and I can think "better" now. Hard to explain but the "fog has been lifted".  Everything is easier now whether its putting something together or understanding the environment around me.  Also my IQ scores appear to shoot up really high but thats up to debate.   I just want to say what a great product this is and I highly recommend it to anyone.  Im sure when I start school this fall I'll see a leap in my abilities.Jaso
Brain Builder is a series of visual and auditory exercises aimed at improving attention, concentration and memory. This consists of seven exercises, one involving visual reaction speed and accuracy and six memorizing a sting of randomly generated numbers presented audiably or visually in one of three modes--BASE (straightforward) REVERSE (you must give back the string in reverse the order given) and FLASH (visual numbers presented one at a time instead of all at once like BASE) or RANDOM (auditory where you cope with numbers being read at an uneven pace). You are then immediately tested by having to type in what those were. There is no time limit on response. You progress to higher levels--which means memorizing more numbers faster during the viewing or listening--from an initially determined baseline test taken when first starting. Different voices--men, women, adults, and children--read the auditory presentations.  All and all, I found it to be fairly sophisticated and the exercises do seem help even beyond matters of number memorization. The primary shortcoming seemed to be the lack of feedback or coaching other than telling you not to get discouraged and to keep working hard.  Also, the progress summeraries (bar graphs) fail to take into account the higher levels for scoring purposes so day to day comparison of results seems too flat. Overall, I have enjoyed the program and have stuck with it although there are some days I wish for more variety and to do something else than just repeat numbers. What they say about only having to practice about 10 minutes a day--well--I've had to spend more like 30 minutes or more to do enough exercises to feel satisfied with my progress
Can't say enough for it. There is so much good work items in it that you probably will never touch them all. I've had every updated issue from issue 5 on up. They have been consistrantly excelant
I've been a Photoshop user since Version 3 and this upgrade is worth every penny.  I upgraded from version 7 and CS2 is clearly a step up.  Upgrading was a no-brainer.  The only negative is Adobe Bridge - I prefer the file browser that PS 7 had but I can live with it.The floating image windows is also a nice touch - you are no longer confined to the PS main window.All of my add-ons worked perfectly including FITS Liberator and the PTLENS suite
This upgrade installed easily with my Photoshop 5.5.  No problems at all.  This is an excellent program and leap years ahead of my Photoshop 5.5.  This is a much less expensive way to upgrade to cs2..rather than purchasing CS2 outright.Be sure to get the updates after you install the program.
I've used Adobe products for years and years and will continue to do so
I upgraded from Photoshop 7 to CS2 and have never looked back.  No problems what so ever and many new features that really make it worth the purchase
Great improvement in Photoshop technology.  I've greatly improved my ability to process astrophotography.  It's now much easier to make the same changes to multiple images of the same celestial object.  Greatly reducing the time required to process multiple images for stacking, aligning and combining.
Easy tax preparation and lots of information, videos, and help.  I even bought stock in INTUIT because I also use their Quicken product.  Awsome products... no wonder Microsoft had their eye on it before
I am very happy with this TurboTax.After my son showed me how to use it,I was hooked.In the past ,I have always done my own income tax and every year it becomes more difficult.My wife is an independent contractor and by using this software,it made doing taxes a breeze and fun
I am a single mom and have never done my taxes by myself. The cost to have taxes done is ridiculous.   This is the best thing ever.  It walks you thru everything and is very easy to use.  I will buy this product again next year.. 
I seriously don't get why people are having problems installing and using Windows Vista. I had no problems installing it and no problems using it. It runs smoothly and responsively. No problems.

This is a very good racing simulator!  But it's no arcade game so if you want to jump into a car and race around with little or no practice this is not the game for you!It will take you time to perfect the driving skills and learn the handling characteristics of the various cars.  You're going to need a good wheel and pedal combo to get the most of this game.Graphics are very good, but the race car physics and handling are exceptional.Highly recommended for racing sim fans, not recommended for the casual race game player
This is the most technically excellent racing sim I have played. The physics are perfect, the graphics are pleasing, and there is a wide variety of tracks and cars. The learning curve can be very steep, but you can adjust the AI to suit your needs. You can also turn on traction control, steering aids, etc., which will get you into the game faster. After a couple months, you'll be good enough to turn these aids off and drive the cars the way they are meant to be driven. There is also a comprehensive driving school which will train you in the basics of racing. If you want a realistic racer, buy this game
Bought this after thoroughly enjoying GT Legends.  If you want to experience the best driving SIM on the market, buy GTR2.  While I love rally, sprints, NASCAR and most other driving games, this one sits on the pole.  Complexity level and your own personal motivation to get better keeps it from getting mundane. Graphics rock.  Get your system up to speed as all these other review suggest and that means a good wheel/pedal combo as well. How good is it?  I've had it several months and I still say it is the best there is.  Semper Fi
This software is very easy to use. I use a Logitech NASCAR racing wheel. Together this game is great
This 'game' is awesome, if you like SIMs...  Do not buy this if your goal is to enjoy a leisurely drive once in a while.  'Playing' it is hard work and requires your full concentration.Great tutorials to teach you how to drive on a track (it is *very*different from taking the family car for a spin).I got it with my Logitech G25 (an AWESOME FFB wheel).  I think thesetwo were made for each other.
I currently have version 1.0 on my pc. It does everything it claims to and does it flawlessly. It cleans internet cache, history, cookies and more! I've tried another internet privacy program, but it failed to clean up the tracks that this program successfully cleaned. I especially like the fact that it cleans the autocomplete entries in my internet search and internet browser. Others can use my pc, and won't be able to see what documents I've recently opened, which programs I've recently run, or what I've searched for and what sites I've visited online. And that's the way it should be! This program can be set to clean up this information securely (can be set to wipe not just delete the info). Another plus, it can clean usage tracks for all users on a pc. The program I tried on my other pc only worked with administrator accounts (and not very well may I ad)
I've been using this product for awhile, and I'm delighted with it. I got my Algebra I Homework done in 1/5 the time it usually takes me! In addition to this, when I feel like learning, I watch some of the Discovery Channel videos that are included with this. Even better is that this product comes with a $[...], reducing its overall price to $[...]. Today I'm going to use it to help me write a five paragraph essay.I love Microsoft Student with Encarta Premium 2007, and you will too! Buy it! Trust me, you WON'T be disappointed
I purchased this program simply for the Encarta 2007. I was amazed at all of the wonderful features that Microsoft put into the package. I feel that anyone in school or not would find this program to be a useful tool in your daily life. Enjoy it.
I wish the reviewer had stated whether MS Office 2003 Small Business Edition satisfies the requirement. Pending clarification, I'll stick with Encarta 2006 despite its less (than 2005 version) user friendly search page.Encarta is an amazing product for kids of all ages and I'm more than willing to predict that 2007 is worthy of 5 stars
This product is a masterpiece.  It's a testimony to early 21st century thinking about the world, the earth, learning, and software.  It's a Swiss-Army knife of information with a kind of practical beauty that we associate with tools that work. Check out the map tool, and the view of the Earth at night.  It's delight and a gift to an active mind.Somebody has thought long and hard about what students need on their computer to succeed.  What they've come up with is an awesome collection of innovative productivity tools for kids.Take math. The math tool alone is worth the price of admission. This is where algebra class should start.  Math lovers will eat it up. For the less than loving, Student includes really excellent tutorials on math concepts.  It even links homework help for many of the major math books.  You put in the textbook, the assignment, and it steps the student through the problems.Homeschooling? Read no further.  Just buy it.  Geography? The map tool, especially the statistical mapper lets you view the world from outer space, with or without political boundaries, and compares the performance of countries on a zillion measures.  Literature?  It's got summaries and readers guides for a huge list of required reading, and not just the stuffy Victorian novels, but Ursula LeGuin and even some titles that I didn't think were worth reading.  The language tools -- you can hear a word pronounced in a surprising array of foreign languages,plus dictionaries and translators, and even plugins for MS Word that make it easy to write in French or Spanish.  No more funny key combos to get a cedilla.Plus Encarta encyclopedia -- which is safer and way more effective at leading kids to track down related ideas than a web search. I'm sure I'm leaving something out.The only problem is, it takes gigabytes of memory and really ought to be partnered with MS Office.  That said, if you take education seriously, you ought to have this on your computer
I initially purchased Creator 9 to do the same thing this software does, but the only thing is it didnt hang my computer when it came down to burn the DVD.  This software is pretty much easy to use, comes with two (Bibles) manuals, plenty of information in there to creat some good videos.  I recommend buying this or you can always buy Creator 9 have it crash your system and then spend a few days trying to review other products out there that have gotten good reviews such as this one. You will be happy with the videos you make. You can make a video containing still images (pictures), video from camcorder camera or from your computer, add text in the movies, add background music, its awesome.  I must say again it wont hang your system. Please get it, your family and yourself wont be disappointed. 
Great product.  Takes some thought, but once you learn it, its great
I would recommend Premiere Elements over any other video editing software I've used. It can do much more than other programs and it is fairly simple
This is going to be a great program that will benefit our family in producing fantastic photos and films
Our photo and video editing softwares were both very basic and "old", so we decided to upgrade a couple of months ago.  After reading many reviews on different bundles, we decided to get the Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 Premiere Elements 3.0 bundle.  We've played around with the Premiere Elements a bit, and it's really awesome.  Much better than the Pinnacle Studio 8 we had before.  All the basic functions are easy to use and very intuitive, though we haven't gone and figured out the more advanced features yet.  The Photoshop Elements is a wonderful tool, as well.  We recently had to scan in a lot of old pictures (as in 20+ year old b/w photographs).  They needed a lot of touching up, and Elements 5.0 worked wonderfully for that.  I could adjust the lighting and sharpening, fix the colors and scratches, and the pictures turned out amazing.  You'd never be able to tell they were scanned images from such old photographs.  The program is also very intuitive.  I could do all the things I wanted to do without having to read the manual.  Of course, I'm still just touching on the surface of what all is possible, and I plan on reading the manual and studying the program in more detail once I have the time to do so, but for what I need right now, it's easy to use and does a good job.  There are only two things I have to comment on that I don't like about the Adobe bundle, and they are the reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.1. The stated minimum requirements for this bundle are 512MB RAM.  That's what we had on our computer, and while the program worked, it was so painfully slow that it wasn't feasible to really use it.  We ended up upgrading to 1GB, and it's been working great since.  So if you have less than 1GB RAM, make sure you upgrade before getting this software!2. The red-eye fix in Photoshop Elements, or lack thereof.  There is an auto red-eye fix, but it doesn't work very well.  It finds red eyes in all kinds of places, just not where they actually are.  Sometimes it covers half the face, sometimes only half of the eye, etc. etc. etc.  There is an option to manually show the program where the red eye is, but it still doesn't work right.  Maybe there's another trick I haven't found out about yet, but as of right now, I usually give the fix tool a shot, and if it doesn't work I take the picture back into my old editing software and fix the red eye there.  I'm really very disappointed with this, as fixing red eyes is something you have to do quite frequently when editing pictures.  Overall, the software has been very easy and fun to work with, even for an amateur like me.  :o)  If Adobe can adjust the minimum requirements recommendation and fix the red-eye fix tool, it's going to definitely deserve 5 points
TaxCut has been very reliable information and easy to use when preparing your taxes.  I have used it over the past several years.  Updates are easy to download and the software is great.  This year the software arrived on a USB key.  This is the easiest and best way to obtain the software.  Small, easy to store and is reusable.  I will continue to use TaxCut in the future
H Block 2006 works well like it always has. I've used and liked H since the Turbotax activation debacle, to the extent that I can like doing income tax! What is great is the media the software comes on. Install the program and then have a nice flash drive to use elsewhere. Maybe flash drives will be like floppies someday, with piles of used drives in a box, but for now it's a super handy way to store and move a few files. 256 megs makes for a big floppy but a small flash drive. No matter--the price it right
I bought this program for my 11 yr old granddaughter and she has very quickly learned the keyboard. I wanted her to learn the correct way to type before she developed bad hunt and peck habits. So much homework now requires typed reports. She had fun with it. It's a great program!
we homeschool and have 1st grader, 4th grader and 7th grader - they are all using the program and learning and enjoying - my 1st grader especially enjoys the fact that it's on an island since he's all about pirates. a great first program
not a bad typing program for kids.  it keeps my kids interested for about 15-20 minutes a day.  they complain about all the practice pages for the games...but , hey!  it's a typing instructor!  you gotta pratice! once they start playing, they have fun
I bought this for my four girls.  they all love it, ad are learning lots.  but the quality of the graphics, characters, and even theme (or story) seem to be low budget.  We have a lot of other educational computer games which are just fun for even me to watch (and play).  The overall quality in our other games is much higher.  It is a lot like comparing Disney cartoons to Speed Racer.BUT...my oldest, who is 11, still enjoys this program and has not complained about anything I write about here
I got this software from Office max. which is on sale for $8 on last week.My 6 year old kid, start learning typing and he keep saying he want to type all the time.Pros:Settings are awesome. You can choose two types of keyboardsYou can choose your words per min speed and many other aspectsYou can choose 4 different musics or do not have any.You can choose the difficulty levels.Games and encouraging things for kids.Cons:Still needs to find one.How does it matter about cartoon chars speaking to you, Adult can also learn from this CD, just by skipping cartoon talk.
I bought this title because the first Typing Instructor For Kids got such good reviews.  I was looking for a way to teach my 8yo son keyboarding.  He has always had a terrible time with handwriting.  I knew I needed really easy, slow-paced typing instruction for him, or he wouldn't get it.Well, it's 6 months later and he can now type!  We did it with nothing but this software.  I made him practice about 10 min/day 5 - 7 days/week.  All in all, he found it to be work to learn this new skill, but still rather enjoyable.There are 11 games included and several of them are very good -- meaning they are really fun AND build typing skills at the same time.  There is also a series of drills, lessons, and typing tests to teach the keyboard.  The keyboard is introducted a few keys at a time, and then you repeat the related drills, lessons, tests, and games until those keys are learned fairly well.  I had to require my son to keep repeating each section of the keyboard until he could do it at 15 wpm before letting him go to the next section.  This is what the software recommends, but I had to learn it the hard way.  At first, I let my son go ahead too fast and he ended up getting overwhelmed.  I ended up having to put a sticker chart on the wall and offering him prizes for getting to 15 wpm on each section.I would recommend this software for children from 6 to about 11.  The cartoon characters are very juvenile and would probably offend a child any older than that.  However, for any adolescent or adult able to ignore the juvenile cartoons, this would be an excellent way to learn to type too.  I found that my typing skills improved just by occasionally using this software.
I just bought this thru Best Buy - could have got a better deal thru Amazon - oh well.  This product is amazing and very user friendly.  I really love the fact that it comes with its very own manual not a help guide you can print out yourself wasting all your paper.  It does everything - the props are very realistic, the shapes  edges so cool.  I have filled in very dark pictures using the watercolor feauture and made poor pictures look like works of art.  Not to mention that I can create my own photomontages, collages,  very unique artistic scrapbook pages.  It took me an hour to scrapbook an amazing page including fixing up photos. I will never spend money on scrapbook pages again!   So much fun!!
I recently wrote a review for this item due to a launching issue. Very angry, I made numerous calls and emails to Nova. At last I was able to converse with a rep who was more than helpful and made right with all my issues. I am pleased with my outcome with Nova and the response, making sure I was a satisfied customer.  I only rate this 4 stars as I am just now using the program and am very excited with what I've been able to accomplish in the past 3 days.  Thank you Nova for your help
I was bought for my 13month daughtor.This is her favorite litte touch book because lulu is very friendly friend.This is worthy of money. We love it
I really enjoy using this program, much better than what was out there 5 - 10 years ago when I last worked on genealogy.  I love the Ancestry.com feature, it is wonderful to go find your grandparents, great-grandparents and even great-great grandparents in the US Census.  I have found out a few things that I didn't know, unfortunately my Mother recently passed away, and I have no one to verify some of it with.  I would suggest that anyone contemplating this program gets it now, and starts working while you still have elders who can help you sort through the information you find.  I also found a family tree out there from someone who only lives a few blocks from where we used to live.  She has traced her family back to the 1500's in Germany...and it appears that they are related to us.  It was strange to go to her website and find a picture of my Great Grandparents headstone.  It was just another branch of the family.  Buy it
I think Microsoft is the best products I have use because I have never had any problems with the software at all but have had other problems with other software was a hade ac
I have used Microsoft Works on numerous computers over the years and find it has the best and easiest programs to run.  Easy to understand and use for alot of different applications.  I have used Word and do not care for it. 
This is a really great bargain.  The spreadsheets are easy to use with built-in formulas just like excel, instead of paying hundreds of dollars.  This was better than I expected for the money.  Excellent product, would highly recommend it for any home business, small business or everyday budgets, events and home bookkeeping.  This is a 5 Star program
Thank you, I like this program and it does what I need it to do
This recommended software is easy to load, except for online requirements to update the files due to changes in the documents from the time of publication/software release.  The files for download was large and took a long time on a dialup internet connection.  The software was easy to use, without documentation, though documentation would have been much desired.  The time to fill in the data was not too long.  It took about 4-6 hours given that I had been filing all the tax info in a folder with all the references required.  The help in the software was great and insightful.  I preferred using a CPA in the past, but since my taxes has gotten significantly easier, this has been a definite cost savings.E-filing was easy, but make sure not to lose the cd-sleeve after downloading the software. Otherwise, it costs extra to e-file.  Overall, it appears to be a great software package with great info and help.  I plan to use it next year, Lord willing!
Over the last two years, I have found H Block's Tax Cut software to be simple to use to process an otherwise complex tax return.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a reliable tax preparation source without having to pay the accountant's fees
If you don't have an overly complicated tax return I found that TaxCut is great to use.  The thing I like most is the interview.  Even if you don't think you qualify for what it is asking, say "yes".  It will ask more questions.  If indeed you don't qualify you have lost nothing and can proceed with the interview.  In tax year 2005 it uncovered something I had missed and I filed ammended returns for 2004  2005 and pocketed $300.  I also was excited about e-filing and direct deposit.  I filed in early February and had both my Federal and State refunds in my account in three weeks.  It comes with Deduction Pro which makes keeping track of things very simple and it all imports for next year.Amazon had the best price at $49 and free shipping for the February timeframe
Everything I need to file my Fed and State taxes. I did not expect the Deduction pro to be included; pleasely surprised. I have used Taxcut for a few years now. I like the import of previous year tax data (less typing).It seems H has an online version. It would be nice if their online version can import data from my purchased version. Oh well, maybe next year
I am a computer repair tech and I can bet 90% of the problems reported in these reviews for this product is because people double install security programs. You should never install more than 1 antivirus program into your OS. Most of the decriptions of problems are from doing just that, double installs. PLEASE PLEASE ..remove/uninstall any previous antivirus programs and 3rd party firewalls. then reboot..use a good registry cleaner-freeware program like CCleaner to remove leftover registry keys, then reboot again and then and only then install your new Antivirus/Security program. I have this program and when installed properly on a cleaned system, it works great. A very good product at a very good price. I can't comment on it's tech support, I have never used it
I'm satisfied with the product. I seem to be getting the protection on my pc; for the cost of product you can't go wrong
Having a study bible on my palm pilot has been very helpful. Whenever I had some down time I always wished I had my bible. Now I do at all times. It is easy to navigate. Takes up a good amount of memory so just be prepared, but if you have enough memory on a card in your palm, it works great. I have used the memorize help feature a lot as well for memorizing verses. Great product!
I purchased this Bible study set to use with my Palm LifeDrive.  It works perfectly on this device.  Truly, it is exactly what I wanted.  It should be noted that the NIV Bible - and the other translations in the set - obscure God's name (YHWH).  This makes it easy for mainstream nominal Christians to attribute Jesus as being the almighty God - instead of being simply the only begotten son of the almighty God.But the translations are otherwise rather good - and the tools offered in this software set make it well worth the money.  After all, God is a judge of hearts and intentions rather than the technical errors of man trying to understand Him.  Jesus preached love of even our enemies rather than legalistic jargon.It would have been great if the set included an interlinear (word for word translation) of both Old and New Testaments.  That would have been a very great addition; but it would have doubled the cost.  If such becomes available I will gladly pay the price
I bought this NIV study bible and really enjoy the options it provides:  Daily memorization.  Morning and Evening Meditation and Many different ways to "Read the whole bible in a year... read "OT NT PS and Pr. in a year".  N.T. in six months".  "Daily light on a daily path".  Etc.  There are many ways to approach your daily study.   Easy to navigate and can even highlight in colors.   I would recommend this for anyone who wants to take the bible with them on the road or to work or wherever you take your Palm Pilot.
This is a great PDA Bible for many reasons, several of which are already mentioned in other reviews.  It is easy to use, has most of the NIV Study Bible notes and crossreferences, comes with a multi color highlighter (great for using different colors for different purposes...red for commands, blue for promises, etc.), you can change the font for easier reading, and it has a great search engine in case you want all of the references to, say "peace" that occured in the New Testament.  The programs that come with it are nice as well, including one that tells you what to read if you want to read the Bible in one year, the OT in one year, the NT in one year, and many more options.I was somewhat disappointed by a few features that would have made it a hands-down 5 star program, though.  The original NIV Study Bible has elaborate introductions for each book, including author, purpose, structure, and much more.  The Palm version is lacking all of this, and has no introduction at all.  The original also has many cultural information boxes all throughout the Bible, like a description of the differences between Pharasees and Sauducees; the palm version does not.  The cross references are wonderful - click on a small circle after a verse, and all of the cross references pop up.  Simply click on a cross reference, and the program takes you right there.  Unfortunately, however, the Palm program has no feature like a "back" button that gets you back to the original text.  Finding your original spot is not difficult - it only takes 5 seconds and a little concentration - but would have been much nicer to go instantly back the same way you can instantly get to a cross refernce by clicking on it.  Finally, I would be actively marketing this product and the Palm platform to all of my friends if it included all of the wonderful maps that the original has - maps of the Holyland, Jerusalem, the Middle East, the Temple, and others that are in my paper NIV Study Bible.  Despite these flaws, however, the program is a joy to use and I highly recommend it to all.  I am using a Tungsten T3 - the larger screen size make reading easier
This is a great program for using a Bible on your Palm.  The only issue was that I had to return the first CD for scratches and the 2nd was also all scratched up.  It worked but ....
I really like this program. I have purchased three different Bible programs for my PDA and this one is by far the best of the three.
I've been using TurboTax since 1999. We run two small companies and my background is in accounting. Hence, I have a VERY hard time giving someone else my bookkeeping and taxes to do, since I really have a hard time letting go of the control! (I've really got to get over that!!) Each year, it seems that TurboTax does nothing but improve! I typically delay until the last minute and cram it all in on April 14, and if it wasn't for the simplicity fo this software, I'd be filing extentions every year. Really, gathering all your stuff together is the hardest part. This software does everything else for you.
Turbotax was a great service, but I would like to be able to navigate with menus/tabs to a greater degree of specificity within the input pages itself. Writing the return often requires back-tracking to a page that you alread covered.To get to a particular prior page, I would often be forced to go through up to 5 or 6 prior pages, reading the question each time because turbotax highlighted the default which was not my previous choice. This was a colossal waste of time in an otherwise excellent product. It could easily be fixed in the 2006 software if turbotax 1) switched the defaults to the users' previously-inputted values (CompleteTax does this and it seems like an obvious thing to do) and/or made it easy to navigate to a prior page by giving a link to every input page when a user clicks a superior tab or link. This is what a good web-page does, and it would be very helpful if turbotax did the same.  
I travel quite a bit and am able to use the digital recorder to take notes while driving.  It has saved me a lot of time and works well
This product is very superior over prior versions.It plays back your text in your own voice.My accuracy has improved in Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 over other previous versions I have used. Having been familiar with prior programs voice to text,it was easy to implement.It was a good investment.The product came promptly, and with no hassles
I was a Norton user for a long time.  I think this is a better program -- lighter, leaner, easier to use.  It automatically updates frequently.  I've never had a virus.  I use wireless and I can always tell if someone is trying to use my system (which is never, but I've tried to break in myself just to check.)  Nice program
I have always used Norton Products for antivirus.  For the previous 12 months I had problems getting the auto update feature to work and as a result had to download new definitions every time I turned on my computer.  (a royal pain!)  At renewal time, I looked around and found PC-cillin software was highly recommended.  I bought it and loaded it easily.  Since I'm not very computer savy, it took me a little extra time to figure out some of the settings.  It works well.  I miss a couple of Norton features like adding an email sender to the blocked list with one click - but updates load by themselves and I've had no problems.
I've been using Norton Antivirus 2002 with annual updates of patches forever with Norton Internet Security 2003. Now that it's time to renewal Norton Antivirus, I thought I switch to Trend Micro Internet Secuirty 2005 after all the glowing wins it received from certain mainstream computer magazines. I like Norton 2002 but it was a memory resident hog in the TaskManager considering I was running a P3 500 laptop with 196MB on WinXP Pro, resources are valuable. Also newer Norton Antivirus version were a hit and miss.  After also reading reviews at Amazon, I took the plunge with Trend Micro. My review of this product can be best summarize along with it's relations to Norton Antivirus 2002 (updated).Pros of Trend Micro 2005:1. Fastest virus scan I've seen. I have not find any virus in my system yet whereas Norton would fail in about .01% of the time( i.e. one stalling virus every year).2. Check incoming and outgoing mail like Norton3. Scan selected files as I chose just like Norton4. Alert and Block virus threats5. Monitor nearby Wifi connection6. $25 mail in rebate making the price net at $15. (It's been 2 months since I've mailed it and not received it yet).7. Uses about 10MB of system background resources versus Norton's 30MB.Cons against Trend Micro 2005:1. Very annoying  auto-virus update every day that I log on the internet. I only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes. I'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so I would prefer to have a preference setting that I can choose myself. Norton is not as annoying.2. On a wifi network, Trend Micro Firewall failed 5 of the Gibson research Shields Up test. Ports were open. Norton Internet Firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which wasn't a big worry. I ended up disabling Trend Micro Firewall and using the Norton Firewall instead as it's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection.3. Anti-spam and data protection were subpar as I got advertisements and  pop-up from certain websites like West Cost major newspaper. Using Norton Firewall stops them dead; never seen them again.4. Still waiting for rebate.Overall, I think using TrendMicro Internet Security 2005 for it's fast virus check and a separate Norton Internet Firewall is the ideal combo for me. On it's own merit, Trend Micro would be perfect only if RAM and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but I wouldn't mind using Norton if I had plentiful more RAM. 
I found the product to work very well for antivirus, spyware and spam.  It is nice to have one product at a reasonable price that has multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products and their associated cost and maintenance.  I had been using Norton 2004, but it only did a good job on viruses.  Although it would detect spyware after the fact, it did a poor job of removing them.  I had also used the MS beta, which although detected more spyware than Norton, would not block it.  I had one computer that always seemed to be crippled with spyware.  Since I installed PC-Cillin, I've had no problems.  I've also found the spam blocker to work fairly well, catching about 80% of the spam.  I had been using multiple rules and a spam list with outlook, that probably only blocked about 40% of the spam, so this is a big improvement. My only complaint is the rebate- I sent in the required info and it was rejected due to "invalid/missing UPS."  I then sent a copy of the UPS they indicated that was missing, but never got anything back.
I purchased this software for my brother to use for his daily reports. He works for a police department and the old documents transferred over quickly and easily
I became a committed user of OneNote in its orginal version in 2003. The new 2007 version seems to improve somewhat on this product's functionality. I use OneNote as a depository for research information collection. I can create any number of notebooks and subdivide each into any number of sections and subsections, which allows me to put information where I want it. I recommend that people who collect information in one form or another give OneNote a try.
This is a fantastic product.  It has endless applications.  I absolutly love it
I've been using OneNote since it was first released.  The 2007 release is the most effective writing/note-taking/information-organizing tool I've ever seen.  Data can be exchanged with other MS Office programs easily.  It can be used with tablet p.c.s, desktops and laptops. Information can be organized by Notebook, Section and Page (great for students to keep their notes organized efficiently).  It is a great way to keep research notes, cut-and-paste exerpts, etc.  This is, quite possibly, the most useful piece of software on the market
I made the mistake of ordering this product and Microsoft Office 2007 which I didn't realize that it was also offered in Office 2007 which I didn't need 2 of them so I gave the other one to my sister who just loves to keep all her records in the
I've been a OneNote user from the original release (OneNote 2003), and this version improves on an already exceptional product. Organize your life using this one application, and never go back to paper again
I've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each.  What was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes. It also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature.  The tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze.  When working with paper, this was not always an easy task to take on.Several weeks ago, I downloaded the trial version of OneNote 2007.  The improvements are rather subtle, but powerful.  It didn't take anything to get comfortable with the new features.  After a short time with the trial version I just purchased it because it was so much fun. Here are some of the beneficial features:-Like a paper notebook you have sections, but with OneNote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like.-You can easily link pages to Outlook. I have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings. It makes being organized for a meeting a breeze.-Also, it's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish.  You can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails.  Well worth your time.-It is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet PC like I do.  I love it for that use.  There is a fantastic text recognition feature that works EXTREMELY well. If you use a tablet, this is a great feature.-As was with the earlier version, you can add voice content to your notes. That's right, voice recorded messages can be added to your notes.  Too cool.Before you buy, you might want to go to the Microsoft site and download the trial version.  You'll be able to assess for yourself.  I think you'll be pleased.  I fond it to be one of the best products for 'electronic file keeping' that I've used.  For the price, it's not a bad deal.
I have used OneNote 2003 for a couple of years now, and it is a fantastic program.  OneNote 2007 is a very nice upgrade.  It is extremely versatile and works with a variety of organizational styles.  I have gone nearly paperless for my projects.  I can pull in emails, web pages, graphics, scanned documents, MS Office (and other) documents, screen clippings (a OneNote feature), Excel tables, links to files and web sites, etc. OneNote 2007 adds a a better, more intuitive interface, and integrates better with Outlook (e.g., the tasks work together better) and other Office programs.  (Note:  I sue Outlook 2003 at work and Outlook 2007 at home, and OneNote seems to work fine with both).  It also integrates better with Windows Mobile Smartphones and PDAs.  OneNote2007 has a Mobile OneNote component that allows you to take notes on your PDA/Smratphone, and sync them with "Unfiled Notes" tab in OneNote.A great program that is sure to catch major traction in the coming years
I enjoy researching various subjects simply out of intellectual curiosity and find Encarta a useful tool.  I'm somewhat overwhelmed by the multimedia offerings but like the chronological updates and appreciate this treatment of current events. 
I enjoy using Encarta 2007 and can relie upon their information. I use it in conjunction with Britannica 2007 to get the most well rounded information. I do prefer the interface and ease to Britannica 2007 but the quality of information on Britannica is always to be trusted. My advice you need to buy both
Kudos Microsoft. My last go around with Encare was with the 2004 version. At that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface. The various modules weren't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore, confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly. The new interface is quite simple but very powerful. It is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating. Perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics. If you have not tried Encarta in a while, check it out, there is much to like. 
This is a wonderful and very useful program, not only for school age kids but also for adults.  It is full of useful information.  It comes very handy when you want to learn about anything.  Look for any topic, you will find it there
Encarta Users will have no problem using and enjoying the newest version of Encarta - 2007It is just as informative as the last versions with a lot of extra kicks, like the newest Videos. Recommend at least 1 GB of RAM and a Pentium 4 Processor with a newer Video card (2 Yrs or better)for the best video viewingIt will run on older system
This was by far a great program, and never had a problem with it loading on our computer. Fast installation and very easy to work with. Plenty of available online, over the phone, or program tutorial help! Awesome program, even comes with a tshirt and 2 transfers
I purchased Panda Internet Security 2007 for two reasons: The price after rebates (Free) and the fact that it is a 3-user license.  After switching from McAfee to Norton (and a subsequent 1-year renewal) I decided to either buy PC-Cillin 2007 or try Panda. (39.99 or Free...hmm...)  I installed Panda on my laptop first (after uninstalling Norton Internet Security 2005).  No problem what-so-ever.  In the initial HDD scan, Panda found and cleaned 5 files that were found in my email inbox identified as a worm.  I then installed Panda on 2 desktop machines with no problems there either.  Panda found 3 traces of spyware on one machine and nothing on the second.  Panda boots up with Windows XP quickly.  It has only given me a couple of pop-up messages (one for a WiFi intrusion, which was another computer on my network...I accepted it and it never came back.  The other pop-up was to start on-line customer service or something like that...I declined it and it has yet to come back.)My laptop is a P4 1.8GHz, 1GB ram, 32MB ATI video, 40GB HDD.  The initial virus scan took less than 20 minutes, scanning over 250,000 files.  Not bad!  Desktop 1's first scan (P4 2.4GHz, 512MB, 128MB video, 120GB HDD) scanned nearly 300,000 files also under 20 minutes.  Desktop 2 was the quickest (P4 3.4GHz, 1GB, 128MB video, 80GB HDD) scanning over 330,000 files in about 15 minutes.I am extremely impressed with Panda Internet Security 2007.  It's everything I hoped it would be.  I would definitely recommend this product to others
Purchased this a while ago and recieved it yesterday.Reason? My computer was moving much slower than it used to. Mcafee scans my computer everyday, and doesn't find anything, yet it was fully updated. I had a feeling it wasn't working.When I installed this thing, I scanned it right away. This is what it found:Viruses: 67Spyware: 312Adware: 51After the scan, everything was deleted and my computer ran like new again. I am very pleased with Panda's software and will purchase again if needed
I really liked this version of Office.  It makes formatting and other tasks like making tables, inserting bullets and the likes much easier. I have not done any work on Excel 07 yet, so I can't give any feedback about it
The product came well-packaged and unopened. I really needed instructions on how to open the packaging. But once I got it opened and installed, the product works as well as promised. The set-up and ribbon menu is a lot more user-friendly than 2003. I downloaded the trial version that Microsoft had offered, and I must say that this is the best Office product offered by Microsoft to date
If you don't need outlook but do need powerpoint, this is a great value.  Before, you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price (full retail $150 now).  Office 2003 standard even on eBay is still going for $175 plus.  This does not offer anything much beyond Office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn.  Also, don't worry about file formats.  You can re-set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of Microsoft Office. 
This is great! The free trial version on download.com had saved my computer (the only program that got rid off some spyware that was in my start-up and causing lots of problems). And I've also used the trial version on several of my friends' computers. It hasn't picked up much, though, since I bought it. But that's probably because now I have a new hard drive and a firewall. Before, I  bought the computer used and didn't know what a firewall was. I should have saved the disk and installed it when I started having problems. But oh well, it's doing it's job and if I start having problems once the CD expires, then I will probably buy a new disk. That's how good it is
Zonealarm by Checkpoint is one the best programs for protecting yourself. It is better than Norton Internet suite
All in all a fine product.  Has gotten excellent reviews from PC MAG.Norton slowed my machine to a crawl.  This has not.Suggest NEVER paying full retail for it unless you absolutely have to.  I've been using it for a few years now and always manage to find a free after rebate deal on it a few months before the one year subscription period is up.It does require the user to provide authorizations the first time it sees a programs attempting to access the web.  For a non techie, this may seem a bit intimidating because there will be a lot of queries from it in the first few days of usage
I HAVE HAD ALL THE ANTI VIRUS PROGRAMS AND ZONE ALARM WORKS BEST.E. FIEL
This is what you need if you want a suite of protection for you pc.I've used mcafee. It drove me nuts. I've used norton. Also drove me nuts. ZoneAlarm worked nearly flawlessly (as well as windows can.) It is a very stable and intuitive program that is what I have been looking for. All I can is that you should buy this and get rid of whatever you're using now, especially if it's Mcafee or norton. Just a sidenote: I run AVG free antivirus alongside this and I also ran it alongside norton and mcafee. AVG would catch things that neither Norton nor mcafee would. Never have had that problem with ZoneAlarm
I have Windows XP which came with McAfee. I used both Norton and McAfee but lately McAfee's updates seem to have giving other users a lot of trouble.  Rather than updating the anti-virus definitions, etc., I decided to try Zone Alarm where many users seem to like it.  I must say that from the moment I installed it the only problem I ran was that you have to completely unistall your current antivirus, firewall, etc. if ZoneAlarm is  to work.  To date the software has worked beautifully.   Actually, I believe that my computer runs smoother and slightly faster.  I definately would upgrade or buy this product again.  Check some of the sellers for the bargain prices.  I bought mine for 19.99, which is a big savings from the ZoneAlarm website.  It is worth every penny
I had to put this review in because of the unfair one previously given.   Before I purchased this software, I checked out 5-6 of the major fish screensavers out their and this one is by far the most realistic, (movement, background, lighting, and noise).  I have two computers, one 800 mHz the other 1.4 gHz processor and the program runs perfect on both.  The goldfish screensaver is just as impressive, if you're into that kind of fish.  Don't let other marine/freshwater screen savers fool you by advertising more fish and backgrounds, the quality in all aspects, especially 3d-graphics and color (which are a must if your looking for realism), are poor.  I personally thought I'd like the extra fish and backgrounds (turtles in particular) in a competitors screen saver, so I purchased it instead of this one.  After trying it, I was very disapointed and luckily I was able to receive a refund.  I purchased Marine Aquariun and have never regretted it since.  What's great is they have a demo on their website your can try out too
I got Tiger to improve the working of my Powerbook G4 1.5.  My Jaguar installation was getting pokey after two years and a clean install with Tiger cleared out the annoying slowdowns in my computer.  Before Tiger, my computer would hang when playing large DV files (such as the ones I made in iMovie) but now they run without a hitch even though the hardware is the same.  This Tiger upgrade doesn't include some of the apps (games, Quicken, etc.) that my wife has on her new MacBook, but it did include a 30-day trial verion of iWorks which has come in handy
What can I say other than this is simply hands down the best operating system on the planet! We were spoiled by how flawless it performed, and sold our PC soon afterward.
Why not have the best possible operating system for the best possible computer.  While this OS is not the top of the line today, it was when I bought it.  If you buy the MAC, it pays to have the best operating system. Stay current.  The hardest jump was from OS 8 to OS 9.  I was unable to bring any of my peripherals with me.  Now it is seamless. Like they say, just "Plug n Play.
Why buy the upgrade when you can buy the full version?Basically cause it was cheap. You will see, old version, new version, 10.4.6, 10,4,8 and so on. I just bought the old version and installed the latest update. Now I am up to date and for a lot less money which meant I could spend the extra cash on more software for my Mac.As far as performance, No faster than Jaguar or Panther. The Benchmarks say faster but if you stare at the screen in any version, the 10 nano seconds you save are not noticable.You will encounter drive issues at some point as this version appears to have issues more often. This seems to be due to the new journaling scheme but I cannot back this up.If possible I recommend you erase the drive you are installing to. In the disk utility, select the erase tab, and then the security button, Select the zero out data option. Note: you cannot erase a drive but only a volume.This will clear out any corrupt data and pinpoint any bad or damaged sectors.The main reason I wanted this was for the widgets. They are a blessing. Calculator, thesarus, package tracking, and many more. Tiger only comes with about a dozen widgets but in the widget configuration button, you will see the more widgets option. You will be directed to hundreds of others widgets for immediate and FREE installation.My favorite is the weather and radar widget as I work outdoors a lot. I am able to quickly see the latest radar and plan my week, all by press F12. No need to interupt what I am doing on the Mac as the widgets will pop up in my layout and my activities stay active. Click any area other than a widget and they hide away.If you want to wait for a version of the OSX that allows you to write your own widgets without taking a programming course, wait for Leopard
Tiger is simply the most advanced personal Operational System on Earth!I am an advanced used. I have used all sorts of operational systems in the last decades: IRIX (unix from Silicon Graphics), SUNos (unix from Sun), Linux, and also the bad written Windows. Everytime I used Windoze in the last 20 years, I had to deal with crashes, hanging, lost of data and hours of configurations, tuning, adjusts, cleaning, etc. Even today, everytime I shutdown Windoze, it hangs, due to some program crashing. It's a true joke!!!On February 2005 I decided to buy a Mac and give it a try. I bought a Mac Mini and started using it.What I have to say is that I am using it for more than an year without an issue, without a crash. System is solid as rock. Some bad written programs eventually crash, but never the system. And I am the kind of guy who works with several heavy programs with heavy documents opened at the same time. Mac never crashed. I am about to suggest Apple a way to make it crash, so we can rest a little bit, instead of working all the time.So much trouble I had in the past with Windoze that even today, while I am using the Mac, I feel like it will crash at any time. Fortunately it never crashed.Beyond those functions advertised by Apple, you will see that MacOS is a superb gold mine for those who want to explore under the hood. Filled with thousands of powerfull unix commands and programs, you will be able to perform miracles.Microsoft is copying everything it can from Tiger and advertising it as revolutionary features of up comming Windows (hasta la) Vista. I cannot see a single revolutionary function on Vista, as everything already exists on Tiger. The most amazing is some sites on the web comparing Vista (a vaporware not yet launched) with Tiger (an actual product).The only thing Gates forgot is that one month after Vista is released, Apple will launch Leopard that will take the crown from Tiger.What I can say you is that for the first time on years I have joy of using a personal computer. 
Everything was perfect until I used Expos. The animation was a little choppy, but that probably has more to do with using an iBook G3 than with Tiger
I found it hard to work with and was disappointed that it wasn't more versatile. My needs are not quite the same as a standard business, however, and I have friends with businesses who like this very much.
It has made my bookkeeping for my small business soooo easy. Invoices in a flash,keep track of your expenses so easily. This program was the best investment and tax deductible! Very easy not complicated!
Before buying QuickBooks you should Google: QuickBooks 2007 Simple Start Free Starter Edition. This free version never times out. You can immediately download 400m or get the CD with no shipping charge. The big limit in the free upgradeable version is you only get 20 total customers and vendors, so it is ideal for students and those with limited needs
Super simple to install, and easy to use.  This program gives you a real perspective of how you use your money.  I created a "personal" account company.  It doesn't have to be for small business only, but will be handy if we decide to set up a small business in the future.  The price was just right for our purpose.
Very  Satisfied easy to load and very easy to use.I started using it as soon as I loaded it with out reading the help or tutorial. I really like the ease of use and the quality of the invoices it produced. I had Quick books a few years ago and the new one is much more user friendly. I highly recomend this program for anyone running a small Business
I have used Quickbooks Basic for a number of years both in my church and for my business.  I have kept QB 2004 Basic since the upgrades were not immediately necessary for me.I chose to upgrade this year to keep current on maintenance, etc. so again I chose the most basic product offered - "Simple Start".  I received it just fine and it installed perfectly.However, it does not upgrade any previous QB files.  As I investigated, Intuit says that it won't upgrade files from previous QB versions on their web site (albeit in small print) and on the product box itself, but that was not ever mentioned in the Amazon listing.So then I had to upgrade to the next higher version - an additional $80.  QB Pro also works very well; it's just a shame that Intuit insists on misleading customers by not providing full information through all marketing channels.  The Intuit phone rep also tried to overcharge me $20 for the upgrade but quickly accepted the correct amount when I pointed out their error a second time.
Great backup solution. I install a second hard drive into someones computer and then let the software run and then forget about it. Never fails. Have not done a restore yet, but I would imagine it would be easy since I have an image of the hard drive and then the data that is up to date. Also, bought the software from a vendor that Amazon recommends, I don't no why they do this, but the software listed on Amazon is $49.99 which is the right price. I bought two from a vendor for $15.00 each. WOW what a savings and a great markup for me
All I needed was to upgrade the hard drive on my Dell laptop, so I got Acronis True Image version 9 for half the price of the current version 10.I put the new hard drive (right off the sealed box) into a USB caddy that I got on eBay for $6, plugged it into the USB port, and ran Acronis 9.  Selected the "Clone Drive" wizard, and less than an hour later it was done.No need to cross my fingers... the new drive booted right up, and I'm using it now to write this review.  What could be easier
I started with Norton Ghost 2003 many years ago and had problems backing up clone images.  Acronis True Image Backup 9.0 has a simple user interface that works well.  I used it to re-image my son's computer without any problems.  It is a good product for the price.  I highly recommend making a backup image of your hard drive on a weekly basis
Heard other poster said v10 has been available, so searched and found it is true. V10 is available at the maker's web site at the same price as that of v9 sold here.  BTW, I planed but haven't buy the product yet. But I have to assign a star number in order to post this message
Easy to install and navigate.  Automatic incremental backups are completed randomly.  Sometimes they work, other times they abort.  Can't determine why
In general...this program worked very well.  I've had a hard time putting my new Dual Core Pentium D computer in the RAID 1 configuration, so I bought this instead.  The clone function works extremely well and is an adequate alternative to the RAID 1 configuration, but I was a bit confused about how to use the "incremental backup" function.  The initial backup went well, but when I went back for incremental backup additions, it would tell me it was "impossible"....so I just clone the C drive every few weeks now.  I have two Seagate 320 GB SATA hard drives, and it's great to know that I have an exact copy of the c drive if I fry it.  I live in Ethiopia, so the power fluctuations are frequent and disastorous.  I've already lost one hard drive to power flux abnormalities.  I'd buy this product again, and it's comforting to know that it's on my system and that I can back up my valuable data easily and quickly when I need to
July 27, 2005Why haven't I heard about the Mia characters before? I bought this for my god daughters 6th birthday without knowing anything about the game. We opened it together and I was BLOWN AWAY with the 3D animation-the same quality as Pixar. Everyone at the party was glued to the computer screen in this adventure land game. Best of all, its educational but because it was so entertaininng, my god-daughter has not stopped playing it. Well worth your money! I'm going to buy the rest of the Mia series
The software was installed flawlessly.  Programs have worked successfully and been exactly what i need and wanted
Perfect solution for using those windows programs we are used to...but on the Mac.  Runs smoothly.  Entourage is a fine email program and Word, Excel and the others work great.  A little spendy, but worth it if you need it.  Entourage communicates well with Oulook and has a similiar feel
Kind of expensive, but didn't come with my new laptop and I needed the word doc's. Works awesome and I get to do power point with it. I'm sure it will be easier to use than later models. Overall, great product
Very pleased with performance; have used it before without  problems
i am very happy with Microsoft Office 2004.  It is easy to install the software. I am using the whole suite of products successfully and easily.  Thank you Bill Gates (and Steve Jobs!)! 
I recently purchased Microsoft office, and so far, I have had the chance to use Microsoft word.  I am familiar with the product as I have had the older version before, with my old computer.  I was pleased to find that I had no trouble with using my old files with this new software.  I also was glad to find a variety of templates which were easy to use.  I was able to print out business cards for me and my husband in just one morning.  I am also glad that it isn't very much different from the old version, so I was able to use the program easily, without much adjustment. 
It's just packed with all kinds of goodies. I highly reccomend it
purchased my Dazzle recorder from Amazon stocked items and found it to be just as advertised.  The Dazzle performs as advertised and a very reliable method of recording movies.  It is very simple to install and operate.  I bought this Dazzle for my daughter and now will order one for myself
This product is simple to use and does a good job converting my home VHS tapes onto DVD.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it supplied the connection cables with the product.  Other than that, I have no gripes.  Worth the money in order to preserve your precious home videos
Don't think about video capture cards, going into the operating system, or even opening the computer case - just turn on the power, plug Dazzle's USB plug into your usb port, and connect the colored cords on your vcr with the same colored plugs on Dazzle, install the software, and let this wonderful tool do all of the heavy lifting.EXCELLENT quality, and they will lower the quality if you want a smaller file - like, say, if you want to back-up your vcr to a cd-r. The test for quality is time - tell it to record to 70 minutes, and your work is DONE.I REALLY like the fact that the software is so stable, I recorded a SIX HOUR VCR tape using a 512 meg XP machine - not a moment's problem.They also included software that makes editing these video files real easy, if you want. That is just icing on the cake.Strong, solid, silent - the John Wayne of VCR to computer file translator tools.As an aside, I have held onto some VCR tapes for years, one for more than a decade, hoping something like Dazzle would come along.Prayers answered.Just shut up and BUY it
The Quality is EXCELLENT! Use it to go out of the Digital Cable Box Strait into the computer. Pinnacle Software is easy to use and edit with and if you have a DVD Burner, makes great menus. I have bought and returned Well Over 5 RCA Capture Devices and this is BY FAR the best. Especially for $50!!!!!! Cant BEAT It
My boys are 5 and 7 and they can play this at different levels and enjoy it very much!! They have played it and learned from it extensively
I did not think that introduction to the game was going to end.  I thought that I may be able to skip it but no luck.  Once into the game I believe that my child was enjoying the game and seem to be learning some great skills.  Lastly, you have to hit the "F" keys and "Esc" to save and exit the game, not many program make you do that today.Overall, I feel that this was a good purchase and I would have given 5 stars if functionally was better with program
the mia series are great for our family.  the kids always look forward to playing their mia games.  they have the math adventure and grandmas remedy.  the two disc thing is confusing...but really doesn't interrupt play.  the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it can be a little glitchy sometimes...mia will get stuck somewhere and not respond.  we just go back to a game saved in a similar spot and restart.  so it's not too big a deal.
Excellent software for kids.  It keeps my 5-year-old challenged and comes with 4 different difficulty levels to choose from. 
great product.  i am in the graphic arts field and corel now works easier with adobe products
I bought this software for the graphics capabilities and my husband is using Photo-Paint to edit our family pictures.  This is the first version of CorelDraw I've used and am very pleased with the help features, find them intuitive and the whole package impressive
I use Corel Draw X3 everyday for designing logos  signs for my sign company. I can start from scratch and produce professional designs in a minimum amount of time. This program offers a wide variety of editing tools, great import/exporting options, photo editing and tracing options.The more I use this program, the more impressed I get
I've been a Corel user since ver 5 or so. It's always been a decent graphics application, but Ver 12 and now 3X are the best I've ever seen. This program is SO INTUITIVE compared to others in this category. It;s particularly easier than Quarkxpress. I know Quark's a page layout app, but you can do the exact same stuff 95% of the time in Corel. Much better PDF's and a HUGE price advantage make this their best version yet. Indesign is also very good but pure useability gives Corel an edge.
I think some of the reviewers here did not use the program more enough, am using it since version 2 till now as an illustrator this program can't be beated... gradient fill was so stupid to create in earlier versions of adobe illustrator u must create two objects then blend them together to form a gradient fill then you have to mask it within a path or the shape you are filling, one more thing the mask in corel "container" is a wonderful tool to have much better than the mask used in illustrator that sucks (u have to see me pulling out my hear if i made i mistake using it) do you want more i have a lot to mention.Am using both program everyday know them very well and to be honest i do all the artwork in coreldraw then i export to illustrator for color separation and printing and that becuase the printers agancies in my country don't know how to use corel so i have to ride the wave and finalize thing in illustrator.I do all detailed drawings precisely using the guidelines and grid (first in available in corel) creating layouts, realistic objects or models with shadings and shadowing as well with ease this software is so powerfull if you are a real artist you must get i
I like this screensaver,because you think the fish are really real and you can feed them and watch them and you tap on the glass your fish will sometimes react. I'm going to keep it forever and ever.The 2 expansion packs to complete my screensaver of fish is the Arowana pack and the funstuff pack. Thank you for reading this cool review and my name is Kris.I really like aquazone
Every once in a while a product comes along that does one thing, and does it really well. The only question is "do you need it" With modern LCD screens and sleep/energy save modes, screen savers are virtually unnecessary. That's really the point of Aquazone, it has no practical value, but it is very cool.Before we got our little dog Tova, we had a fish tank for a number of years. I do miss some of the relaxing aspects of watching fish swim around and interact. Fish are generally low maintance and considered by many a key stress reducer. I think of this screen saver program as a virtual tamagotchi or a aquatic version of the Sims. You can do everything you would do with a normal fish tank: add and remove fish, feed them, tap on the glass (or the keyboard in this case). Even better, you can mix fresh water and salt water, no worries about two male Betas in the same tank Fortunately you don't have to clean the tank and you don't get algae. If you want fish not included in the tank, you can buy some more onlineIf you ( or someone you know) enjoys fish and want to buy something fun and rather frivolous, this is a great program. If you aren't into fish, probably not worth buyingPros: Does exactly what is says, creates a virtual fish tankCons: Probably a productivity waster at the office, gotta love fish to enjoy the program
I have a PowerBook, an iMac, and an eMac at home that are used in different ways. The kids use the eMac for school work, and my wife  I use the other 2 Macs for home business.Although most school work was required in MS-PowerPoint or MS-Word, exporting from iWork '06 Pages and Keynote was very simple to do with 90-95% accuracy. Our kids said they just do minor editing at school before submitting the work.For home business, we use Pages to do our proposals, bills, and receipts. And use Keynote for presentations. One thing that I thought was amazing, is the fact that I can display the notes and the succeeding slide on my PowerBook, while projecting just the current slide for the customer to see. For the price of the Family Pack, we were licensed to use iWork '06 on 5 Macs on the same network. The cost fitted our budget perfectly. The only thing I wish was available in Keynote was timed transition (example: after 3 seconds show bullet#1, after 5 seconds show bullet#2, after 2 seconds show the chart
Well its definetly improved version since the last one, but they still have a lot of things to do.  The biggest problem is Pages.  If text has specific symbols, like Greek letters and u try to export your file to doc, forget it.  u'll have the same problem as 10 yrs ago, either funky symbols or underline dashes.  Keynote is much better.  But if u r a scientist and not a sales man, both packages still have a lot of room for improvement.  However, I'm still happy with this purchase, because it's Apple soft and looks much nicer than any MS software will get in the future
I enjoy the Aqua Real 3D! Its enjoyable to have fish but its a lot of work to keep it up. Having this 3D virtual reality fish is fun and brings the enjoyment w/out the work. Its very relaxing to watch the fish and to listen to the water. Even my cat watches the fish...
My husband wanted an aquarium screensaver for Christmas. Dumb gift, I thought, so I wanted to get him the best one. Online shopping made it easy to see my options and get him the best one for the best price. He is very happy with it
Abobe hits one out of the park. I find Adobe software clunky and hard to use. While I understand that the more flexibility you want the more complex the program but Photoshop and InDesign have learning curves that are steeper than Mount Everest. I expected Lightroom to be the same - an excellent program with a huge learning curve. Well it is and it isn't which it why Lightroom is such a pleasure to use. I don't know what Adobe is thinking in creating this gem of a program but the team who designed it are collective geniuses. For they have taken a complex and sometimes frustrating chore and for lack of better words made it gentle and pleasing. The program makes spending time with your photographs actually enjoyable.Lightroom is fabulous from look and feel to functionality. The strength is not only in the photo management portion of the program but also in the strong photo developing functions that can turn an OK photo into an amazing one.If you do anything with photographs buy this program. You won't regret it
I used the public beta of lightroom , it was amazing  I couldn't wait for final releaseof it , I ordered it , helpful for photographers. ****** Nondestructive editing ******High recommended
I've only been using Lightroom for a day, but I was pleasantly surprised with the Photoshop integration. Just hit Cmd-E, and Lightroom creates a copy of the photo (with our without the changes you applied in Lightroom) for editing in Photoshop format, and groups that copy in a stack with the original. As you save your changes in Photoshop, the image is updated in Lightroom. I felt that the workflow was very smooth.
This is a great software for Photographers looking for a faster way to manager and edit images. I gave it a four because I would hope that ADOBE would still find ways to improve this product. The functionality is superb, and for such a great program, it doesn't eat too much memory on your computer (I have a 4 year old PC with 768 MB of RAM). And because of this I'm shooting more pictures in RAW format and not worry about the time I spend in front of the computer.I'll definitely be buying the next upgrade
Within a couple days after installing Dragon, it showed a high degree of accuracy. The accuracy depends on how late at night you dictate.  It was installed on a 2.7 Celeron with 512 of memory.  The program generally keeps up quite well. The program works with Comcast and AOL free ride but seem to have a lot of glitches with aol.com
This is probably one of the most outstanding and rewarding software programs that I can ever remember purchasing. I never learned how to type, so I reserved myself from many computer projects/reports, email responses and business related aspects due to this 'achilles heel'.Well, I researched this software and found that it has come a long way from earlier versions and decided it's time to give it a try. I even bought a Plantronics CS55 - USB wireless headset from the get go to give this software a real workout. Let me tell you, my pessimism was definitely challenged because the software worked extremely good about 20 minutes after opening the box and browsing the tutorial. I was talking sentences and watched it appear on my monitor within seconds. I speeded up my speach as if talking in a normal conversation with someone and this software just kept spitting it on-screen. AMAZING!!!! Don't get me wrong. There are occasional misspellings to deal with but your user profile keeps getting updated everytime you use it and prevents the same mistakes from occuring the next time. It begins to gain more and more accuracy.Salvation has been found as far as I'm concerned.P.S. I began running the program with WIN XP - 512MB Ram and it performed very well. I just upped to 2 gigs ram. Most everyone in forums recommends at least 1 gig Ram.I did this review in about 1 min. and had only two misspells.
The program seems to be much more accurate.  I am still learning but I feel it was a worthwhile investment.  I can write my e-mail much faster now.  I highly recommend it and I feel it was worth the cost
I really enjoy this product, and am sure that voice-recognition will be standard techology for all computers one day.  It is very easy to load, set up and use....  everything that I needed was in the box. I speak with a slight accent, and it still works so smoothly. This is an invaluable tool for people at risk from carpal tunnel syndrome, for those who have difficulty using a keyboard efficiently, or for avoiding the fatigue of preparing large reports. It is so simple that you can speak out ideas and visualize them in print before deciding what to do next.  Great for doing e-mail...  all this and you can continue using the keyboard as you wish. I love it!
i really like my new windows vista upgrade.the graphics are stunning and it is extremely user friendly.infact, i liked vista business so much, i upgraded to the ultimate version.both versions are very easy to install;many people seem to be waiting for 'all the bugs to be worked out' but, honestly, the bugs aren't a problem.it is important to run the advisor about -is your system ready for vista before you install- to get rid of any conflicts your computer might have with vista;other than that everything else is a breeze. Use my system about 6 hours a day and am using a xps 700 dell computer go for it, you'll have lots of fun!
Product has a nice clean interface. I was able to load most drivers and application software without incident. Note - Upgrade install requirements are not clear. Microsoft should state what is expected on your system prior to trying to install either as an upgrade or clean install. Microsoft sites keep pointing back to sites that don't help very much.
GREAT PRODUCT. JUST ONE DOWNFALL.  CHECK WHETHER YOUR PRINTER AND OTHER SOFTWARE/HARDWARE IS COMPATIBLE FIRST.  I'VE HAD WINDOWS VISTA SINCE IT CAME OUT AND MY PRINTER DRIVER IS STILL NOT COMPATIBLE.  WHICH MEANS I HAD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER PRINTER IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK.
I just upgraded SD v4 to SD5 and could not be happier. Release 5 has had a very rocky start to say the least. I do believe they released it a bit early. Fortunately I read the SD forums daily and only downloaded version 5 when it seemed the big bugs had been dealt with.I have always found this product to be the best in it's class. Best detection and moreover removal. Easy to use. I've also had the product that is typically rated number 1 and for me it is no contest which I will stick with. This is my main, real time anti spyware product. I think one big plus is their customer service availability. This is important.  They are very responsive. Their forums on their website are also extremely helpful. Customer service is also free.  This application is fast and is not a resource hog. I have a lot of confidence in it. Also recently just downloaded their PC Tools Plus firewall...it's another great product and it is free!Basically a good company to deal with.  I believe when the dust settles from this new (albeit too early) release of version 5, you will see Spyware Doctor attain 1st place on many tech lists
PC Doctor works great ! It removed spyware that other software did not. It is a memory hog and slows your computer while scanning, but it is worth the time. I turn off the software when not using the internet
yeah its great. get rid of ur piece of DOO-DOO windows operating system and pick yo self up dis! aight piece yallz. and remember once yo go mac ya neva go back
The upgrade went smoothly and Tiger 10.4.6 appears to be as stable as 10.3.
This is my second version/upgrade.  It is very easy to use and I sought it out when upgrading my previous version.  Love it
I am very pleased with the new 2007 Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe.  I have owned previous versions of this product and for my needs, I am well satisfied.  I especially like the ability to use suggested greetings and clip art to enhance my rubber stamped cards and scrapbooking projects.  I have used this software to print banners and business flyers as well.  It would be nice if multiple images could be contained in a text box.  Maybe in the future there will be more enhancements to this product for easiser use.  I am pleased with the card selection, verses and graphics.  For non professionals, I believe you get more than a fair value for the price
We purchased this program on the recommendation of a friend because we have a 4-yr-old grandson who's very interested in art and is comfortable with computers.  Turns out his older sister has the program in school, kindergarten.  They both enjoy having this to play with when they visit
Great product.  My child has autism spectrum disorder and this is a program that holds her interest.  She really likes the different music she can select and says some of it helps to calm her down.  I love it
I bought this program for my daughter for her birthday.  She wanted it because she's used it at school (1st grade).  I was impressed by how easy it was to install - I installed it as admin, and she had no issues running it under her limited account (XP PRO).I've been impressed with what she is able to do with the program.  She even made Valentine's day cards for her whole class with it.Just be prepared to go through a lot of color ink
At the elementary school my children attend they have it on their computers.  So they were begging me to buy it for them. Its very user friendly, even my 5 year old can play with it without assistance.  
Good product but, it's kind of too complicated and difficult to set up and fine tune to work the way we required
Essential for Microsoft Office 2007 users running Windows Vista. Office 2007 already provides a PDF converter; however, it does not allow for security, editing, or markup. PDF Converter does--and without the Tech Support hassles at Adobe. Since my new HP computer came with Adobe Reader already installed in the Vista environment, I kept it as the default pdf reader, and I use PDF Converter Professional for actual, stand alone conversion or editing of pdf documents. PDF Converter had a very easy Custom Install feature. I disabled all Microft Office, Internet Explorer, and Outlook add-ins, and I installed the product. It all works together extremely well.
Excellent product works as advertised and so simple to use. Product well packaged, arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition. ScanSoft responded with an eMail in a timely fashion acknowledging receipt of my Rebate paperwork and provided a pin number for me to access their site to check on it's progress. But you know Rebates....they take forever!PDF Converter 4 is not my only ScanSoft Product. I also use Paperport 10 and am extremely satisfied with that.My buying experience has always been positive with Amazon.com vendors, never a problem.John Mc LaughlinDaytona Beach, Florid
I have not used this product for very long, and was somewhat reluctant to purchase another brand besides Adobe who seem to dominate in this softward category, but I have, so far, been plaesantly surprised with the performance  features.  The ScanSoft PDF Converter Pro 4 software seems to do all Adobe can do (and a little more), at a fraction of the exhorbitant cost of Adobe Pro 8!.  I'm happy with my purchase thus far!
After looking at the other reviews, I was a bit puzzled.  I haven't had any of the problems other folks mention. PDF Converter Professional 4 doesn't do everything that programs costing FIVE TIMES as much money.  But, WHO CARES?  Background colors in a business form?  WHY????  Don't buy a Camry and say "gee... I liked my Lexus better."Most of you are going to buy this program to do one - or both - of these two things:  1)CONVERT PDF DOCUMENTS into completely editable Word docs, Excel Worksheets, or one of dozens of other formats...2)COMBINE documents of various formats into a single pdf. Picture a CUSTOMER MANUAL that consists of Word, Excel, SolidWorks, Quicken, PowerPoint and Project documents.   You want to put them all together in ONE document complete with Table of Contents, Bookmarks and Thumbnails.  VOILA!  This is the proram for you! And for these purposes, PDF 4 Professional is SUPERB.  It is EASY to use. We have SEVERAL users, and not one has had to refer to a manual or on line support. To put PDF Converter to the test, we recently scanned, then saved-as-a-pdf a crooked, not highly legible fax.  We THEN converted it into a Word document, and roughly 90% of it came through perfectly.  AMAZING.HIGHLY Recommended
I understand that software companies strive to give new versions of their products "new" or "better" appearances but in my opinion toos and defaults should be recognizable from version to version as much as possible.  I have used versions of Corel since CorelDraw!3 I just moved to X3 from 10 and find that the trace tool works better but the mechanism is somewhat cryptic.  I would have great sympathy for a buyer that is using it for the first time if they had never used an older version simply because I could only figure it out through past knowledge and trial and error.  The results were great but the methodology lacks some of the intuitiveness of the past versions.  The pallettes are far less comprehensive thn version 10's pallettes.  I truly wish I had version 8's pantone pallette back even though it is incomplete it was so much better layed out.  i will never understand why black has to be at one end of the pallette and white at the other, waste of time...   The tools are all there but they appear different.  I went to work in X3 fright away and found I could work effectively on day one but I did resort to version 10 (which I have kept on my system) a few times in the first week to perform operations that I coupdn't figure out in X3 which were simple in 10.  The Help files are circuitous, apparently never actually getting to the point.  The on line tutorials are great for the absolute novice but useless to anyone who actually has worked with vector art before.  The Export to AI is still a little inaccurate even after all these years.  (You cannot select a line terminus and expect it to be there in AI) The EPS export filter doesn't always want to be readable in Adobe either.  The price is excellent, the product spectacular in its own right and I am happy with my purchase. I expected a little more in this version than I got but no less than I had with additional compatibility.  I still need to have a copy of Illustrator on my machine to deal with people who have only that program
This is one of the best graphics suites that I have ever used.  It is very user friendly and all the my students that I have used it have really liked it.  The toolbars are easy to find and the entire program is filled with outstanding graphics tools.  This is a must have for anyone who is serious about graphics
CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number.i stayed with Corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches, bugs and the dreaded "odd-numbered" curse (if you tried version 5 or 7, you feel my pain). Adobe Photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... CorelPhotoPAINT just never quite "did it" for me.Industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into Adobe Illustrator. Being already familiar with Adobe Photoshop's features, tools and "look and feel", Illustrator didn't present a huge, overbearing learning curve. In Illustrator, i found the same robust features as CorelDraw ... which wasn't what impressed me about Illustrator. Adobe's intuitive programs, and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... THAT is what won me over to Illustrator. Illustrator's ability to edit/create PDF's in their native format? WOW! Exporting LAYERED vector files to Photoshop ... with layers INTACT??? WOW!!! (i could go on)Now, that being said ... there are STILL things that i prefer in CorelDRAW  compared to Illustrator. The EXTRUDE function in corel is MUCH easier to utilize. The PowerClip function is more user friendly than Illustrator's "make clipping mask" function. The ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature. (again ... i could go on)In regards to importing and exporting files from other applications, CorelDRAW wins, hands down. It boasts a ROBUST set of import and export filters, my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves DURING the import. This is a MUST HAVE if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack. If i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into Illustrator with fonts blown out ... i'd be independently wealthy. WHY Illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me.So, to sum it up ... CorelDRAW is a great program ... but i can't imagine it being my ONLY vector drawing program. Just like in real life, you need a great team. This program, paired with Adobe Creative Suite, meets my needs perfectly
I am average when it comes to design, but the tutorial helped me in creating a logo and it's cheaper and better for me to create one myself than pay someone to do it.  I like the tracing feature which allows you to remove parts of a photo to place in a new background.  To get the most out of this software you really need to be familiar with a lot of the features already, and there's a lot I am missing.  I will just have to take more time to keep practicing and learning from trial and error
I have been a Corel user for years.  This latest version is a great improvement.  Esp for Raster to Vector tracing.  I have always preferred to use Corel over our Illustrator even though I have both installed on my system.  Corel just seems to be a much more user friendly program.  Very powerful for anyone from Novice to Pro user
I have used Corel Draw since it was Draw 5 or 6, I can't exactly recall for certain so I guess some would consider me a software guru. I have also used other top level design tools and can tell you the fact is the Corel Draw Suite X3 is a robust design suite that has a very palatable learning curve.The scope of what you can do with the software is amazing so certainly there is a new set of words to add to one's vocabulary however with terms like Pick Tool, Rectangle Tool, Ellipse Tool, and the like, I believe that it is pretty logical to get an idea of what the tools do just by allowing the mouse pointer to rest over the tool for about three seconds so the application can display the tool name and even the shortcut key to select the tool. The icons also give a pretty clear visual representation of what the tool will do e.g. a capital A is the text tool and guess what you do with it ... it allows you to add paragraph text, and artistic text. After you learn a bit about the text tool you also see that it allows you to place text in your document on a path.The text on a path is just that... text on any path in your document. This can be a freehand line, an ellipse, a circle, or any other shape you care to make. How many of you have ever wanted to put your text in an arch?  In Corel Draw you simply make an ellipse with the ellipse tool, choose the text tool from the tool box, move the mouse pointer over to the ellipse and the mouse cursor changes to the text on a path icon and you click the left mouse button.  Now you type whatever you want around the shape that you have created.  If the text is not the size, color, font, or position you want you can change it, color it, or move it simply by selecting the pick tool.I have developed a program to teach technology skills to middle  high school students with various disabilities in 46 sites throughout Oklahoma and the Corel Draw Suite is the first software application the students use. Do the students know how to do everything with the software after the first week, or fourth, or tenth? No, but if it took a week to learn it would not be a design tool in would be something like Print Shop Pro where almost everything is done for you and you just type in the text. There is nothing wrong with PSP but if you want to truly be creative, if you want to have the ability to design anything that you can see in your minds eye, then the Corel Draw Suite is the tool you want.My program has a website that shows some of the work the students in the program have created. Just do a search for Tech-Now Oklahoma High School High Tech and you should be able to find the site. The section on weekly curriculum is a pretty good place to start but I encourage you to look around. Almost everything you will see on the site was created by the students using the Corel Draw Suite.Corel Draw is a program that can be used in a matter of minutes but is as deep as you can possibly want to go. 
I think this software is excellent for biginning designers like me. It gives a great range of choices to help you expand your imagination  create new personal things each time you work. The only problem faced me was that it doesn't support other languages, but it works with wordart
I love this product. I had so many pictures that need to be in a scrapbook. This was so fast and easy, also it only took a couple of weeks to complete. I didn't over spend on paper,tape,glue, and etc. With three kids I don't have the time to sit down and cut, measure and more. with all my pages completed. I added a FEW things to go along with the theme of my page. I even used left over Christmas wrap to fill the 12X12 for Christmas pictures/theme
Very easy to use, lots of clips and templates.  Loading glitch won't let disc 3 load, have to use program with disc 3 in the CD tray.  Otherwise very happy with the program
I bought this software for my wife for Christmas.  The quality of this software is outstanding.  It is simple to use, but has many, many features.  I would recommend this software for anyone who likes to scrapbook, but also for those who enjoy doing anything with pictures.  You can make calendars, greeting cards, birthday cards etc., as well as flyers.  The price for this software is very cheap for the quality and the amount you get from it.  It is a must
Among the various offerings available, this is perhaps the most complete. Each offerings has some unique capabilities that others don't possess; but if you want only one product this one gives you the closest match to a professional product that can be used by print shops
It's exactly what I wanted to buy: Complete collection of Ultimate X-Men. I don't mind scrolling up and down on my laptop in order to see the whole picture. The ads were kind of annoying though. I just hope Marvel puts all the other X-Men series on cds like this
I had a hard time putting this one down. I quickly read through the entire collection and it was over too quickly. I would recommend this to any X-men fan especially fans of the old comic books and it certainly takes up a lot less room than if I had the hardcopy versions. My only complaint is that it ends at the beginning of a new story. Ah well..
This works fairly well for me.  It easily downloads the capital gains from Microsoft Money, the interviews are fairly straightforward.  However there are a few areas (like foreign tax credit) where it should be automated but isn't.  But on the whole it does a nice job, they just need to improve it a little every year then it could be a 5 star item.
Worked fine for standard items. Did not handle Partnership issues completely. Would be good to have a preview of the finished return before printed (maybe this is possible, but I did not find this function).In general, an easy, straightforward program that gets the job done
Got this game for my 12 year old and he LOVES it!  You need to have a pretty new computer to use it and it took a few trys to get it downloaded.  Once it was installed it was a really wonderful game!  If you have a child that likes puzzles and figuring things out, they will love it too
Make sure you get the cheats to keep a lot of cash in the bank. This game is totally addictive.
First of all, I want to make the point that this is a strategy based tycoon game and a sim game.  It is really well done using superb graphics and animations.  You get to apply new discoveries in your factories so you can make a better product and out sell them to your competitors.  It all seems to be based on real history so you get information from real sources like the Wright brothers, Edison and even Einstein. And you also have to worry about the people that work in your factories, your scientists, and accountants and even worry about industrial espionage. If you like business, engines, buildings, science and physics, you'll be getting hours and hours of play out of this game.  You also get to play in a bunch of different cities in the world.  Each one has different challenges. It's fresh every time you play since you can do things differently and see how the results vary
Took a couple of attempts to load this program on my laptop but once installed, it's more than I expected.  This is my first experience with GPS and I'm impressed with how quickly and accurately the GPS system locates my position and tracks my movement.  Full featured mapping software and plenty of GPS options make this an excellent value for my needs
Would highly recommend. We attend dog show that are in the middle of no were... This product got us to EVERY SHOW  we have been to since we started using it in March 2007.We especially in enjoyed the feature of being able to find what kind of business were in the area were.We hate getting lost especially with a truck loaded down with dogs and conformation equiptment, this product has stopped that from happening.   It would be nice if the 2008 version: 1 - it spoke the name of the streets while it was giving you the next turn 2- it would get rid of that agreement screen everytime you use it, once should be enough and 3 - It would be nice if we could log on to the web and down load the latest addition of gas station, place to eat and etc...  while we were down loading the construction updates. This product is a good buy for the money.. 
Just completed a 1600 mile trip from Ohio to Virginia Beach and the Microsoft Streets and Trips with GPS worked better than expected. Only lost the GPS in extremely hilly areas. No loss in towns. This thing is very precise for the low price paid. If you pull into a place such as a Gas Station, you have the address immediately. It can route you back to your mapped routing if you make a wrong turn. Pressing the space bar will get you the next turn in case you missed hearing the last prompt. This is a powerful program and should be an asset to any traveler. A co-pilot is good to have but not totally necessary. As mentioned above, it will route you back to your road if needed. A great buy. Would be nice if the prompt would name the street or route
Purchased this to help navigate a trip from Northern Michigan to South-west Florida and back again. We took a fair amount of side trips and having this on our laptop made it easy to get to where we wanted to go.  There were a couple of times that we went "off route" but were back on route in very little time.  It helped us decide where to stop for fuel, eat and sleep.  Up-to-date information is available with an internet connection and the larger map-viewing area was greatly appreciated.  Well worth the price.  Highly recommended to others
I have been a long time user of Delorme Products but decided to get a combination of Microsoft products both for the US and Europe (Autotrip). The program loaded very smoothly, but do make sure you load the program before plugging in the GPS Locator.  There are multiple warnings about this as well as what to do if you don't follow directions.  I loaded all the data on my laptop so I would not have to carry the DVD.  The setup was also quite simple.  There are warnings about usage in an automobile that pop up in use (as well as the cautions during setup).  One needs to keep this in mind and not be distracted when driving.  I set the mapping program and forget it.  But it works best with two people in the car with one to navigate.The GPS locator has a great chipset.  Very, very sensitive and quickly finds the coordinates within seconds, even as I sit in my house.  It rarely loses a lock on the satellite.  The route finding works well, so far.  You can save your track as well as the route, but unlike the Delorme products you can't playback your track (or if you can, I have not found it).  The screen is pleasing and you go fullscreen.  I haven't tried voice recognition but the spoken commands are about average.  The ability ot overlay satellite photographs when planning routes with an internet connection is a plus.  Plus you can routinely update road construction sites.  So far, no opinion on how good that feature is.  The Microsoft location finder internet leaves something to be desired though I've only tried it at home.  It routinely thinks I'm in China (which is interesting because so many ads are quite able to figure out where I am).  The GPS also works with other programs by selecting a generic NEMA GPS.  There are other optional equipment to go with the GPS.  If you've never used a GPS mapping program with a laptop, Microsoft S is a good choice.  Just don't be surprised if the GPS lcates you accurately and the Microsoft locator product puts you on the other side of the planet.
I do a lot of work out of town and in other states, so I am constantly in unfamiliar or different places. This GPS has saved me tons of time and within the next two months will probably have paid for its' self in saved mileage that I used to spend looking for places. I have recommended it to everyone that I have talked to. It's great, I will never have to Mapquest or ask for directions again. Another Great Microsoft Product
This always was a Microsoft good program, who needs know how be and for where, this is a good choic
Connecting the cables was so easy I was sure I must have missed something.Recording the music is equally easy.  Removing the snap crackle and pop was a snap.  My only confusion resulted in recording from 45rpms, I should have left them as stereo because it seems as though if you check off as mono, you can not remove the crackle and pop
This product does a superb job at converting audio cassette recordings to MP3 format on your computer or MP3 player.  You can adjust the audio level and pause the recording and advance the audio cassette if you need to do those things.  There are other automatic features to shut off, etc. It also can remove noise from the recording and clean up the transients
Xitel INport Deluxe does what it says it does.  You can plug in any RCA AUX connector into the unit and with the software provided you can record it in stereo to your computer.It's a good solid product that does what it says it does but instead of focusing on the features like other reviewers I will point out its minor drawbacks. First, audacity, the a free software that is mentioned in the manual has a tendency to freeze up while recording with the unit.  However, I don't know if it will freeze up on your computer.  Second, if you are thinking about buying this product to turn LPs to CDs, into most LP players don't have RCA AUX plugs and you'll need to buy an addapter.  (What they don't tell you in the manual is that if you do this you first need to adjust the volume on the stereo and recorder volume in parallel which is kinda tricky.) Finally, the manual could use more detail because some of the important features weren't mentioned.   If you don't mind these drawbacks, you will be able to have many years of recording pleasure if you buy this product
I bought this to transfer LPs to CD. It is simple to connect to the computer, and the software is easy to use. Just be sure when you download  the MP3 encoding program,  to put it in the same directory as the LP ripper.The LP recorder works  well and is very easy to use. The LP Ripper, makes it easy to trim the tracks, and then encode them as MP3 files. When saving them as MP3's I can get approximately 20 LP's on one CD.I am very satisfied with the product
Product is excellent does what it says and then some.  Instruction for installation and operating are very easy to follow (a winner in my book).  I had issues unrelated to this product running into problems with the stereo I was using in the fact that it didn't have outputs for audio so I was forced to use the headphone jack which required further purchasing adapters for the RCA cable was a bit frustrating but had nothing to do with this product.  I converted 2 albums last night into wav files cleaned them up with the audio cleaner included in the software.  Used the editing ripper included to split the 1 recording into separate tracks, actually the software does that for you but you have the option to preview there start and ending points for each of the tracks in case it may be off. I only had minor adjustments the ripper was pretty much on the money, overall.  I then downloaded the encoder recommended to work with this software and converted the wav files into mp3's with no problem. This is an excellent buy for those out there looking to do there own audio transfer of lp's and cassettes.  The sound is excellent on playback.
This product is very easy to install and use. In couple of minutes, I was able to set it up. I used the phone jack to input the music from cassette player to the computer and it worked well. The reason I give it four star out of five is that it records the music in wave format and there is no software in the package that converts wave file to DVD/CD/MP3 format
INport, excellent job, I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone.  I've had several hundred LPs sitting in boxes in the basement for years and now I'm rediscovering that music all over again as I transfer the LPs to the digital age.  The quality of the transfer is very good (imo).  For example, I was playing back So. Central Rain (early REM) in ITunes and noticed that I had purchased the song on ITunes about a year ago.  Except for an opening click on the LP version, its very hard to tell the difference between the two.My only minor negative (or really, feature request) would be for LPRipper to somehow integrate and automate song titles from the albums so that I don't have to type them all in.
I received this product and have been using it for a couple of weeks.  It is exactly as advertised.  It is very easy to use and the software is extremely user friendly.  I am amazed at the quality of the recordings.  I would definately recommend this product
I ordered the wrong Spanish Language Learning Sucess kit for my husband for Christmas.  Although he had taken off the outside wrap, Rosetta Stone graciously allowed us to return the set I had given him and in return they sent us the version he had originally wanted.  Rosetta Stone made the return very easy and fast
I've only just started.  But so far, I am very pleased with this language program.  My only regret is that I don't have enough time to keep at it.  The various learning modalities are quite useful-this is the only program (aside from taking a class) that i've used which does this.  I recommend it
What I like about this software is that it does not come with too many "gadgets." At my age, I am "technically challenged." So this software worked out fine for me with my limited computer skills. I also like the fact that this software covers Castilian Spanish. It is probably the only course available that exclusively covers Castilian Spanish in such depth since Pimsleur and Learning Like Crazy only offer Latin American Spanish courses.  The downside of this software is that you will not learn much Spanish grammar with it. If you want to learn the rules and mechanisms required to combine words and form sentences in Spanish, you will have to buy a good Spanish grammar book. For that I strongly recommend Spanish Grammar for Independent Learners by Avigail Azoulay, Arie Vicente. It is more expensive than other Spanish grammar books but it is well worth the money. 
I have windows vista Home Premium  and i tryed four diferent antivirus from diferent companies and no one works well i have programs conflicts and lot of errors on my Laptop, and then i bought Norton 360 and work Wonderful, this norton realy protects your computer and detected malicious internet pages is a good security for my lap and my privacy.I'm happy and my Laptop too now works just like when i boght it 2 mounths a g
Streets and Trips has been a significant help in making our travel plans. We use it in conjunction with our Garmin 2720 GPS system and they are very complementary. The Garmin system doesn't use downloads from the laptop and Streets and Trips therefore allows us to do trip planning on a braosder scale at home. This is a very good program for trip planning
Although I did not purchase this product from Amazon.com (...), I absolutely love it.  The GPS locator provided is amazing and better than I thought it was.  It is not one of those GPS that updates your position every 20 seconds or something, but when I zoomed in I could see my current location constantly moving on the map (so it is updating every second)...I have ridden with deputies in my county as part of an internship and the GPS provided to them isn't even this good.  I recommend this software and GPS to anyone
I am very satisfied with this product since it does every thing that Microsoft describes in their product description. I am also happy with the price at Amazon.com since I saved about 30% of the advertised retail price. 
I travel a lot; this product saves me valuable time in unfamiliar surroundings.  I have my laptop open on the seat and plot my position and where I want to go - it's easy!  If I miss a turn, the "reroute from present position" feature is great!  It takes a little getting used to, but if you tend to be more visual, or you don't generally do well with maps, or maybe you just want to know where you are in relation to where you're going -- MS Streets and Trips is tops
Used this for a trip from NW of Chicago to Houghton, MI (in the U.P.) and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections (lost signal a few times). This works best when you have two people (driver and navigator) as looking over at a laptop while driving isn't a good thing! Would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price I wouldn't expect it
This is a cool game in a lot of ways.  I was jazzed about it because of the era it represents.  But the complexity and inscrutability of the setup menus is somewhat offputting.The huge disapointment, however, is this:  The online registration code is missing.  Utterly missing.  And there is no resource available on the net to help.  The U.S.A. help number is disconnected.  You will not be able to play online.  Period.  The developer's forums are full of posts about this problem.  No resolution....  Beware.Demand more of the makers of the products you purchase.  This is extremely bad
SimBin makes an excellent simulator. This game has brought me back to days days of yesteryear in great delight. The physics, sounds, and graphics are top notch. The game is fun and the ranks seriously tough. Online capabilities are fine except you have to unlock cars and tracks through the game, which could take weeks
This is no GTR, but it shouldn't be either.Being a huge Simbin fan I have to say the GTR series are still the best. Although there are times when GT Legends historic cars can be quite the challenge, and really a blast to drive....and in the end, thats what its all about
Thats really my only complaint with this game , every time you buy a racing game the cars all seem to be the same . Being in Australia , we had our own fast cars , the Falcon GTHO Phase 111, the HK Monaro GTS and who could forget the Torana GTR/XU1 , Ok this might mean nothing to someone over in the USA or England . But they where supercars in their day ,that said its still a great game for all petrol heads old and young a lik
I bought this product based on my research of users opinions and found it has lived up to their high opinions.  I have boxes of family photos as well as numerous camcorder tapes of family events.  I wanted an easy comprehensive program that would let me arrange photos and video clips, add music and burn on a DVD.  This program does it all and more.  It may not do everything extremely well, but for the price, well enough to put out an impressive DVD.  After about two hours of getting familiar with the program, I was able to create a DVD that had 35 pictures and a video clip with background music - stunning results.  I played the DVD on several different brands of DVD players and had no problems.  Looks great on TV.  I've had no problems running the program on my computer - I'm running this on a Pentium IV 2.9 GHz, 1 gig ram and 200 GB ram HD.  Since I am a beginner/weekend hobbyist, this suites my purpose of sharing pictures with family - I'm finding much better to share on DVD than paper photos.  For an all-in-one package at this price, it does the job very well and I would recommend it.  
This is the best version of Office yet. The differences are numerous and very significant, it is well worth the investment!
A great new interface including control layout, easier than ever to use, and complete. There is no other product in this class. It looks great in XP and even sharper in Vista.Subject to some agreement with Adbobe, you'll have to download the free PDF writer from Microsoft (the beta came with it), but it works exactly the same and otherwise no suprises.The product is pricey and you may want to purchase a smaller release (less applications in the suite) depending on your needs
I am a user of Acronis backup and very satisfied with it and was hoping that the Disk Director would be the same however it is a little more complicated to use, I partitioned a drive then wanted to convert back and have not yet be able to do so, I know that you can but just haven't found out how yet, it could have been made a little more simplier to use
The product does everything they claim save one. It won't work inside  Windows XP (service pack 2). But it will work when you boot from the disk. That isn't a problem in my view. Therefore I have no complaints
Excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives. You can format, partition, split, merge and a whole lot of other things. If you purchase a large backup hard drive I recommend this software and the Acronis True Image software. With both, you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c:\ drive in one partition and daily backups of My Documents in another. This way in case of a HD crash you have a bootable backup. (Note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive.) Thats why I recommend both Acronis software packages
The item was received promptly and worked perfectly. Thanks for a great purchase.Bo
I am a Friends fan and I really enjoyed this game. The questions vary in difficulty, and the narration by the characters is a nice feature.Regarding the issues with the keyboard, the keys for each player are indeed very close together. Also, when two players can answer the same question at the same time, it's easy to press the wrong key by mistake. But I guess in time you can get used to the keys.I didn't have a problem installing the game, although I have a CD recorder and recording software installed. I didn't choose the full instalation, since the CD has to be in the drive anyway, but the game runs properly, it didn't seem to freeze when reading from the CD.Compared to SceneIt, it's very different. This is a complete trivia game that keeps score and announces the winner. SceneIt is a board game, and the DVD is used to ask questions, and in order to play it as a trivia game you need to keep score with paper and pen
well if you are you will love this game! i recommend it to anyone who loves the show! fun game-easy to use interface. i say go get your copy now!!
wonderful game a true challange for any die hard friends fan two big thumbs up!!!!
This DVD-Rom game is so interesting and there are even some questions that I don't know after watching every episode numerous times.  I highly recommend this for Friends fans of all ages, regardless of whether or not you have seen every episode.  Also, I love that the game can be played by only one person, for those nights that you find yourself alone and want a few Friends to keep you company
Love the program.... Hate the company!I've been using QuickBooks for more than 10 years.  I started with the basic edition since I am a very small business and use only a portion of the program, specifically Customer and Vendor Lists, Invoicing, A/R and Purchase Orders.OVERKILL is an understatement... QuickBooks Pro is much more powerful than I need.  I don't use Payroll, Check Printing, Year End Accounting and many of its other functions.  SO WHY DID I PURCHASE SUCH A POWERFUL PROGRAM?That's the "rub".  Intuit is not satisfied with its QuickBooks users being content with the edition that they are using; Intuit sales people call all too frequently trying to get you to upgrade to the next higher version (edition) of their program.  They hounded me for years to upgrade from the early basic edition to the then current basic edition; finally, they dropped support of the product and I had no choice.  I purchased QuickBooks 2005 Basic Edition in 2005.  Shortly after purchasing it, they informed me that they were no longer going to support the 2005 Basic Edition and if I wanted continued support I would have to upgrade again, this time to the Pro Edition.  This January (2007) I received an email from Intuit informing me that my 2005 Basic Edition wouldn't run on the new Windows XP Vista platform and if I switched to Vista I would need to upgrade to QuickBooks Pro.  I upgraded to a new PC in February as the result of a major crash on my former system and opted to go with Vista, thinking that I could install Windows 98 as a second operating system to run QuickBooks 2005 Basic.  The second operating system didn't work out and, after seriously considering switching to Microsoft Accounting 2007, I purchased QuickBooks Pro.I was very disappointed that Intuit didn't offer a significant purchase incentive to existing users; but they never have in all the years that I've been using their product.  Even Microsoft, the shark of sharks, offers incentives.  DON'T BE MISHEARTENED.I purchased the program from Amazon and, with rebates and other purchase incentives, saved $60 over Intuit's price; I could have saved an additional $25 if I had bought on eBay (had I known it at the time). 
I upgraded from the 2003 version with no major problems.  The 2007 version is a bit easier to use and works just fine for my small business. The security, however, is not great for a mid-sized company. Since my accountant fully supports the product, they are always available for support
I have used this product for over a year now.  The reason I bought it was for the back up software.  Email was a secondary consideration.  Let me talk about the back up for a moment.  It is quick to download and about that easy to start using.  The set up can be done in two ways.  Either by default, or manual.  I chose the default version which covers my home folders and it automatically backs up everything to my external hard drive at a time of my choosing.  It will also set up a seperate version of a back up of vital stuff to an online storage for you that you get when you buy .mac as well.  Restoring a lost file couldn't be easier.  just click on restore and the locate the file (or files) you want to restore.  The program is set up so that everything is named exactly as you originally named it on your hard drive.  You don't have to look for your file name in a long string of code.  Just select it and click restore.  It will either put it in the exact place of your old file or in new location of your choosing.   I haven't really messed with the other features yet, but the email is spam free and has been my default email for over a year now with out any problems.  Hope you buy the service and will enjoy it as much as I have
A couple of years ago, we completed the transition over to the Mac platform in our household.  Both my wife and myself have a desktop and a laptop, so leveraging the .Mac service to keep our personal configuration settings synchronized across computers has been fantastic.  Further, with the sharing features that are available, we each have access to view the other person's address book or calendar.  One of the great features of the .Mac service is how it is tightly integrated into the operating system.  In addition, since the Synch Services capabilities in the operating system are documented and open, third party programs can write plug-ins that can leverage .Mac to propagate settings to different machines.My favorite feature (and the catalyst for my initial subscription) is the Backup application.  As someone who has suffered the inconvenience of crashed hard disk drives far too many times, I wanted a simple, comprehensive, easy-to-use solution that I could use to backup my data to an external hard disk drive on a daily basis.  I've used other Mac-specific programs before and none are as easy to use as the Backup you get with .Mac.The only real critique I have for the .Mac service is the amount of space available on the iDisk.  When services like Google Mail can offer 2.7GB of space for free (granted it is supported by advertising), it makes the .Mac the space available with .Mac seem meager.  Of course, considering a full backup of my data/settings takes up about 8GB of space, I may be outside of the demographic that the .Mac service is targeting.  However, in this age of digital media (pictures and movies), the amount of disk space people need for their "memories" is only going to go up.But I guess that is why they have external drives and DVD burners
I have had .Mac for years and enjoyed using its functions.  I have a number of photo pages hosted as well as some iWeb sites.  Plus I use it for syncing and backup, etc.  I am not a power user, however.  But it's a great utility and particularly when you have other family members who you want to have access it some of its features easily. 
Use it with new Xerox Scanner and once the correct set up is utilized, it works wonders. Very satisfied
High Fives to PaperPort 11 Pro!  Being in a business where I am constantly told to print this and print that off of one website and another,  a product like PaperPort Professional 11 has really come to my rescue.   The product has given the opportunity to do something with a document, picture, or file other than printing Now when I  select the document or file and hit my print option button,  I now can print it to a multi-page PDF,  If I choose to do so. Files that I download, scan, save, or  archive are no longer just random clutter on my hard drive,  I can retrieve the information from  them effortlessly using the product's powerful search engine.I was thrilled to find that its All-In-One Search Engine was able to work with files generated in many MS Office applications.  All I needed to do was remember some of the content text and the PP Pro 11 would find the file for me.Now I'm stacking individual MS Office Files into logically-named PDF groups or using the product to search the web and retrieve information of interest, I find  PP Pro 11 to be well worth the money and my time to use it.
Excellent program.  I love the improvement in Outloo
This is a great product. The tabs make the programs easier to navigate through than toolbars. Also, I love the preview features.
Microsoft really got it right this time.  It is the best of the best
Simple and easiest to use of T Shirt programs.  Don't be put off by the low prices.  Simply Magazine, with their Simply Media brands, have lots of craft products like this, with all of them on Amazon I think.Mar
I read horror storied about 7.0 Nero so I upgraded to 6.6 from 5.5 by going to the Amazon new  used market.  This is a good program that does all you need for DVD's and CD's.  It gets good reviews.  I can't imagine what happened to 7.0 but they may have gotten carried away with "user friendly-ness" - I see a little of that in 6.6 compared to 5.5
6.6 Ultra is an extremely good CD/DVD burning suite.  It even has an excellent schedule-able backup/restore utility that burns to disk.Do NOT use the OEM version - it's like diet Nero.  And do NOT for ANY reason get Nero 7.0.  You have less than a 50% chance that it will work at all.  (I am speaking from experience here!
Nero 6 is a wonderful product, but you need to get a legal copy of the full retail version, not an OEM CD or a CD of questionable origin. At this time (April 2006) the best place to get it is from the Ahead Software website (the makers of Nero). (You can get a retail box of Nero 7 just about anywhere, but Nero 6.6 seems to be more stable and provides all the functionality most users will need.) You can download a demo, then purchase a serial number to unlock the full product. It's a smooth, easy transaction. After many headaches I discovered that the OEM version that came with my DVD burner would allow me to capture video from my camcorder, but wouldn't let me burn them to DVDs. My choice was to either buy a CD of questionable origin (and one that is almost certifiably illegal) on eBay, purchase a DVD burning plug-in from Ahead Software for $24.99, or purchase the whole suite for $80.00. I chose the latter. Using my installed OEM version, I purchased the serial number, entered it into the product (very easy to do), then downloaded the latest updates, and I was off and running. This software produces very high quality DVDs and can burn a disk in 15 to 20 minutes using an inexpensive 16x NEC DVD burner. I am now a happy consumer with a stack of DVDs containing transferred videos of great quality
how can doing taxes get any easier?  this is my fifth year using turbo tax and I think each year gets easier and faster.  I love the way my information from the previous year is brought forward and the ability to e-file is just a click away.I can't imagine using any other program
I bought Finale Songwriter to make lead sheets with chord symbols.  It worked well for my project.  I have no complaints.
As a retired teacher, I wanted the ability to compose a song and share it in a pristine form.  Finale SongWriter does that.  The lyrics find their way to the correct note.  The Midi connection works and all the parts of a composition is enveloped in this software. One of the attractions for me is the cost.  Finale SongWriter does not extract your final dollar from your stash.  Try this program, and you will find many facets hidden that makes Finale SongWriter a positive
Word space for the other language is not work performed or designed. For english OK!work's good
Look, notation software is notoriously expensive.  All musicians know that.  So, when you see SongWriter and its price, it's a relief.  Everything you need is in this program.  I only have one complaint.When adding an expressive dynamic (p,mp,mf,f,ff,etc.) you have to add one to EACH note to insure proper playback.  That is a concern of mine since I use SongWriter to notate songs and export them in MIDI for recording purposes.  It leaves an ugly looking score.Other than that, this is the best deal on the market for what it is
I bought a 3 user Zone Alarm Suite for far less than Zone Alarm offered for a single user upgrade. It pays to shop around, and Amazon is often where it all winds up
I bought ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite for the included ZoneAlarm Pro firewall (it cost much less that way).  If I didn't already have Norton Antivirus, I'd use the antivirus, too
I like the product and bought it after having the individual versions on a couple of PCs.  It was easy to setup and I love the feature set.  The vsmon.exe file uses a lot of memory, though, and the PC seems to slow down some. 
With a per-user price of $8.33 (when priced at $24.99 for 3 users), this is a wonderful deal and was just what my 6-computer office needed. It was easy to install and appears to work well. My staff loves the anti-spam feature.
I got a hold of a Windows Vista Ultimate disk.  It gave the choice to install Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, or Ultimate.  I installed Vista Home Basic, because I only have 512 MB of RAM. Likes:I like the new wallpapers and the way it looks.  My Documents and My Music folder remind me of iTunes.Dislikes:Don't like that my less than 6 month old HP printer doesn't work with Vista and my USB net link cable doesn't work with Vista.  When you install something screen slowly fades out and then a window comes up asking you if you want to run the program and trust it.  It's a little annoying because it forces you to stop what your doing and answer the question before you can continue.  Verdict:I like it, but the incompatibility issues are enough for me to want to stick with XP. I wouldn't buy Home Basic.  If you really want Vista, buy a new computer with Vista preinstalled or install a trial version of Vista to make sure everything works.  I'm going back to XP, until HP releases Vista drivers for my printer.I'll write reviews on Home Premium, Business, and/or Ultimate if I ever get more RAM.My Computer2.8 GHz Pentium D512 MB RAM128 MB Video Car
Some existing programs, such as Norton System Works, are not compatible with Vista and Norton insists that you pay for an upgrade to the 2007 version. Other than the compatibility issue, Windows Vista Home Basic works fine for me.Larry Leika
At home, I've been a Mac user since 1991. I also have been something of a Linux fanatic too and have used several distros, mostly Red Hat and now Fedora Core. At work, however I have used MS-DOS, Windows 3.11, 95, 98 and XP. It's fair to say I have never liked Microsoft. But on a laptop I use at work (an older Gateway 400VTX with a 2.2GHz Intel Celeron), I just upgraded to Vista Home Basic. I also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1GB. And despite my years of eschewing Microsoft, guess what? I must say I really like the OS. It runs fine on my slower system and I had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers. I think Microsoft has really made a "cool" OS
I was hesistant to upgrade to vista for a while but I decided to invest and see what the hype was all about. I have a P4 HT 3.0 Ghz with a good video card and after upgrading my current desktop to 2 GB of ram, I found that vista runs really well on my machine. I bought the home basic because microsoft advised it and I dont need any of the other features offered in premium. I love the graphic capabilities of vista and the functionality is really nice. I had no problems using any of my programs and had to only upgrade my video and sound drivers after installation. Vista installed all of my updated device drivers for me as well. This is definitely a solid OS and I would highly recommend upgrading to vista if you have the recommended hardware requirements
I have been using McAfee products for the last 7 years. I did not have any problems with viruses, but it is true, I try to stay out of dubious web sites. I purchase my McAfee software from Amazon every year because of their rebates and every time I see 1 - 2 star ratings. It is unfair. Their products are excellent.I have installed McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007 on two computers so far. The first one is a Dell laptop. I unistalled the previous 2006 edition and Ad-Aware (since Ad-Aware and the 2007 ed. are incompatible) and the installation was perfect. Not the least problem.I ran into problems though with my desktop. I have tried to remove the 2006 edition and I could not find a remove button in Windows' Add/Remove Progrmas. I poped the 2007 ed. in and it said that it will remove the old products automatically. After the instalation the Firewall did not work. I noticed that somehow the old 2006 ed. was still there. I went to McAfee's web site and I got a removal utility that got rid of all McAfee products on my computer. Another great tool I used off of their web site was "Virtual Technician" which told me that the entire installation was messed up. However, after cleaning up with the other utility I did a fresh installation and everything works perfectly.It took me a few hours to get a hold of the problem, yet I love to play with computers.McAfee should not be hold accountable for a product that performs excellent in normal conditions. I continue to trust McAfee's products.I love the cleaning utility. It is very thorough. I plan to use it every day before visiting banking and financial sites. It cleans all of your internet traces.It takes a while until you get used to where all the tools and settings are placed, yet any new complex bundle of software would present you with the same challange.I hope that the 2008 edition will have the anonymizer built in. It would be a great tool.In the end, protection is what it matters, and McAfee Virus Scan and Personal Firewall have done it for me for the last 7 years
I have used McAfee antivirus for years and it is an excellent product.  I bought the suite this time and found it will not allow you to run a different firewall (ZoneAlarm) in my case.  That is the only negative I have found so far.  The McAfee firewall seems sufficient so far
Excellent service, and the product worked extremely well.The only criticism I would have is the cost of Postage. it was ridiculous, the product came in a big parcel, and inside was a dvd.
I am an adult trying to learn Piano.  This program is great for learning simple songs and does have a very good feedback system.The lessons are taught with plenty of simple songs which you can play and the feedback system will track how well you play.  The feedback system tracks your key presses, rythem, and note length.  However, it does not track the strength of your key press.I would like to see more exercises to develop better basic skills, instead of just playing simple songs.  Also, the feedback program can be very discouraging for children as it is very sensitive and report very minor error.Overall, this is still a great program to have for self learner, but in no way will it beat a real piano teacher
I received my eMedia Piano and Keyboard Method today and it's not a bad program by any means, however I have two gripes with the software: First, either the "full screen" option in Preferences doesn't work or eMedia feels that 640x480 counts as a full screen, so if you have your monitor set at a higher resolution (and what Mac user doesn't?) you'll need to lower it in order to read the lessons' text, and since you most likely won't be sitting as close to your laptop/monitor during these lessons, this is kind of important. Second, You need to have the program CD in your computer to get the sound and video to play, and the whine of my optical drive is mildly annoying while trying to study/practice. There are workarounds to bypass this type of copyright protection silliness, but it makes me mad that I need to resort to doing this. If eMedia's so paranoid about theft of their product, why don't they just stream the program's media portion from their website?  At least it wouldn't be noisy that way.Other than these two flaws, the program is excellent for self-starters like me. Plus it seems to be the only complete, low-cost piano/keyboard instruction software out there for Mac OSX. I would have wrote this review after a few weeks of lessons instead of my first day learning but the optical-drive issue really bothered me.
I thought that I could never learn piano on my own. All the material that I ever looked into either didn't have enough information in it or was too complicated for its own good. Because of this software, I am constantly learning new things, and slowly improving my skills as a future pianist. If you are a beginner, you want to buy this software. It's done wonders for me
Great resource.  Best parts are the chapters with the lessons on what the threats are and how they can specifically hurt you.  You can't protect yourself from something without knowing what it can do to you and how it works
This CD is a MUST HAVE! You cannot afford to NOT buy it. The information is comprehensive and easy to follow. The format is perfectly set up... you can review a section many times if needed. Every family and individual in America should view this CD to know what to do when a terrorist attack occurs... not IF, but WHEN, it occurs. For instance, before watching this CD I had no idea you could use regular household items like dish soap or bleach to remove radioactive materials from your skin, but these items will make chemical burns worse. I feel much better having this knowledge from the CD, and this is just one example of the useful and critical information I learned. The preparation checklists on the CD are awesome for planning ahead. Knowledge will be powerful in protecting yourself and your family in the event of another attack
I'm an amateur at website design/building, so understand that I'm not very "deep" in Dreamweaver's abilities. However, I got the program to switch from Adobe GoLive CS2 which had many quirks, bugs, and frustrations. (One example - while you upload your changed files to the web server in GoLive, you can't do anything else in the program. Single tasking!?!?!) After just 30 minutes or so of working with Dreamweaver to update my site, I'm already sure I've made the right decision! I have a long way to go in learning what it can do, but my first impressions of the product are excellent
Great Product - I found it to be very easy to use and hassle free
I'm new to web design.  I've tried other products, including Frontpage, and found them too cumbersome to use and the results were not what I wanted.  Dreamweaver is the best. Easy to use, with more tools to make your web pages look great, even for a beginner.  And there is a lot of support and tutorials on the web to help you out
I'm a hobbyist musician and like to do home recordings. This program fits all of my basic needs. This is the first piece of audio software I've ever owned but I know a lot of people who are more experienced are very unhappy with what I guess are unconventional layouts and commands so be warned if you've used Audition 1.5 or CoolEdit. However, as my introduction to music editing, the control scheme seems very intuitive to me and I like the endless options Adobe provides for organizing the workspace. One tip: if you are a student or teacher, don't spend $300; do a google search and find a site that sells this product for a little over $100. 
I like the features the same as I did with cool edit 2000. I haven't had the opportunty to explore all the new features, but it looks promising...
QuickBooks lives up to it's reputation of being the one-size-fits-all small business book keeping software.  It does what you want it to do.  I like the feature of being able to easily sent e-mail invoices.  If you need the software right away it is just as cheap at the office supply stores
I became interested in this after trying a more advanced program for my business. After weeding through too many option that didn't apply, I knew I just needed somthing simple-- a good way to monitor money in, money out. This program is simple and easy to adjust if you make a mistake.  I highly recommend it, as it is exactly as described
Overall a good product; Learning curve did take some time. Provides needed items for use without having to purchase more expensive and extensive version
CD installs easily, it even comes with a nice short instructional video. Once installed, ZoneAalarm is fairly unobtrusive, but seems to get the job done.Well-designed product
THIS IA A TOP RATED ANTI VIRUS SOFTARE.THE PRICE IS GOOD AND THE SOFTWARE IS GREAT
I am satisfied with the product.  For that matter I know it before I bought and I am satisfied with it.  The only glitch is it will take some time to start and until it starts we may not be able to browse or use any applications that needs internet.  Still I would suggest it is a best option to buy one for ur computer safety
This product is a very simple to use, extremely efficient tool.  I am very pleased with results it produced for me
Seems to do the trick.  I don't use it personally but Mom likes it
A great program. Pretty easy to use. You have to play around with it to learn all the things it will do. I bought it usedfrom a list on Amazon and it was fine. Really like the program. Linda J Johnso
Over all I am very happy with the product. It has paid for itself in this short time by just making Happy Birthday cards. I am not totally happy with the product and I am not sure if I would buy it again. The product is well worth the money you are paying but their is a few things which I am not happy about: 1. Even though the product gives you CD's which contain Art and Project Models their is more art and projects on the Internet. To access these art and projects you need to go on the Internet which is not a problem. What is a problem is that if you want to get on this site and a lot of other people are on the site already you may not be able to get on the site. If you cannot get on the site you cannot finish your project. You will have to put it away until some other time when you can get on the site. This is frustrating and annoying. It makes you want to take the entire program and through it out the window and buy another brand.2. The other thing I was not happy about was, I was given a coupon, in the box, for a 1 year membership to the "Million Image Club" To get into this club you have to fill out some paperwork and submit it on the Internet. After it is reviewed you are then sent a pass word, over the Internet, that allows you to go on the site. Well, I filled out all the paperwork, sent it in over the Internet, as required, but was not sent a password. Well, I tried to find some one to talk to about this but ran into a brick wall after spending a lot of time being directed from one site to another only to end up with no answer to the problem. It seems that Broderbund does not control the product but "Encore" does. You will receive almost no help at all from "Encore". The only place to get help is from a Forum which couldn't give a reasonable answer on what I should do. So, I am now not getting access to the "Million Image Club", to tell you the truth, I don't really care. When you finally can get on the site you have hundreds of images and models to choose from. You really don't need a million more.	
I have been using Printmaster Platinun for several years and love it. I scrapbook constantly using all of the features. I have printed thousands of items with this program. If  people have problems with the program it is because it uses alot of memory and the problem is their computer.  I have gotten rid of 10 scrapbook, photo programs and only use Printmaster. There is no better program.  Ann
I've been using PrintMaster for years to create greeting cards, party invitations, banners and posters for my kids' school. This version has a lot of great new art and images and my son has even made personalized cover for his iPod. I'd reccomend it to anyone who likes PrintMaster or wants to create great-looking projects at home
I chose Office Ultimate 2007 as it seemed to not only have everything I could possibly need to run a business, but also easy functionality that would keep me from pulling my hair out because of software or design issues.Ultimate 2007 certainly doesn't disappoint!  - Set up was fairly easy:  two disks came with the package.  Disk One contains most of the software and Disk Two contains applications that guarantee that you are the owner of the software and have the right to all of the Accounting and key business functions.  - Ribbon technology removes the old "hunt and find" menu method (although for those of us that took the time to memorize and learn the location of every buttom and drop-down it did take a day or two to get used to the new set up).  - Integration with the web and other programs is virtually seemless.- Excel is no longer the chore it once was because of the above mentioned ribbon.- Accounting software is included.- Ink and Crossword.  I'm not one for games on my business pc, but for anyone that likes to doodle or zone out with crosswords, ULTIMATE lives up to its name by including an art program designed for pen users and excellent crosswords.  - OneNote.  I like post-its (perhaps a little too much *L*) and always used the Post-It Note software on my business computer to keep notes.  I used OneNote 2003 sparingly because I simply found the Post-It Note software easier to use on my desktop, BUT...with my Tablet PC One Note 2007 added a new dimension to my notetaking that I feel will work well with my business:  the earlier mentioned web and application integration and handwriting to text functionality.  I may still use Post-It now and then for quick notes or perhaps the Windows "Stickys," but the long note pages, pasting of images and other web info, and pen to paper note taking makes this product invaluable.- Word.  What can I say?  This is my primary software tool and I use it on a tablet pc.  The 2007 applications were made for my computer type.  I can easily click on formatting tools with the touch of my Wacom pen and I don't have to stop mid-thought to make a change or wait until I finish the document to then make my edits.- PowerPoint, Publisher, Access, Groove, InfoPath et cetera (also included): I am still delving into these, but they appear to have all of the perks of the other programs.So, did I have any dislikes?  1.  The INK program doesn't respond to my Wacom pen as well as the Windows journal or Microsoft OneNote.  It also doesn't have easy to use tools within the software. Since it was an "extra" and will not be my primary desktop publishing, design, or art tool - I'll probably remove it at some point from my tablet. 2.  Microsoft does not include an instruction manual or reference book with this program.  As a result, after installation of the first disk and Microsoft's statement that all of my programs were installed, I couldn't find my Accounting software, had no idea that the Accounting software was on the second disk (the second disk, when loaded, doesn't mention that the software is on the disk until AFTER the software installation is complete and instead mentions other business applications), and wasted over an hour trying to find it.  Also, I'm a "hands on" person and although I have access to the internet whenever I need it, I enjoy having an actual book in my hands from time-to-time while learning.  Ultimate is made with enough simplicity that a manual isn't really necessary (i.e. most questions can be answered by the "Help" window), BUT...for the hefty price tag, I don't think it would have been too much to ask Microsoft to include a basic "this is how you install the programs and this is what to expect" booklet. Also note:  athough Microsoft, through their downloads e-mail updates, provided a "Getting Started" tab with a "how-to" for each major software applications, the tabs had to be added "after the fact" and many of you might find yourselves frustrated with the lack of upfront instructions on how to use the software.Beside those few quirks, I fully stand behind my 5 star rating of this product and purchasing this product through Amazon (i.e. Amazon's pricing was less than the big boy retailers or online vendors).  Shipping turnaround with Super Saver:  2 days.  
For the first time in several versions Microsoft has changed the file format.  However, it is for the better.  The new files are all compressed using the ZIP compression format so files are MUCH smaller (old files are 3-4 times larger than new files).  The new file formats are supposed to be compatible with a cross platform specification (i.e. Linux geeks can open Office documents).The new interface is RADICALLY different.  Do not install this if you have a large project to complete.  The interface is SO different you will not complete on time.  However, after a month of so you will wonder how you ever got along without it
Having used the Office programs for some time, I was a bit put off by the new ribbons which replace the old menus.  I guess that Office needed a new look, but I am not sure if I buy the advertising that the ribbon will make my work more productive.  Some things that you should know about Office 2007 and Ultimate in general.  The licensing agreement allows you to install Office 2007 Ultimate on two computers, one of them being a laptop.  I found this clause in the legal agreement and even called Microsoft Legal to confirm.  If you make modifications to the Quick Access Toolbar (and who won't do that?) and you want to take these changes with you to another computer, the files for the toolbars are located at:C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\OfficeWhere username is your username.  Something I have found handy when working with my two computers.One thing that I don't like is that the file name extensions have changed.  Gone is the familiar .doc for Word documents.  Now the file extension is .docx.  If you want to create a document that can still be opened by prior versions of Word, you must purposefully choose to create a .doc file, but you lose some of the functionality of the new files.  The .docx file This format is not the same as the OpenDocument standard.  Microsoft promises that older versions of Word can still open the .docx files, but I have not tried it and I don't buy into everything that Microsoft promises until I see it happen.  Why couldn't Microsoft just leave the files the same as they have always been?Office 2007 does look slick and I anticipate that I will warm up to it in the future as I get used to the new command structure.
Microsoft Office Ultimate 2007 is fairly good once you know how to use it. It is a a little difficult if you are new to how the menus work but once you know how they work it is fairly simple to use
I read the review centering on the box the DVD comes in and must admit that I was stumped as well.  It was "different" but I don't foresee this as being a problem overall.The new Office Ultimate 2007 loaded quickly.  How quickly?  Well, I had to check my new Vista HP notebook because I couldn't believe that it packed all of the programs onto the system in such a short amount of time.  It asked for the Product Key and one or two other bits of data but that was it.  Out of all the Office suites I have owned, this one loaded so quickly I was sure there was a problem.  Nope.  Access, Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, Publisher, OneNote, Excel, Groove and a host of others were there ready to be activated (don't worry; you only do it once, not for each separate program.  Naturally, if you are like me and totally dependent upon email, you'll activate Outlook first).  The new Office "feels" different.  The ribbons are OK but I would suggest that they allow us the option to retain the Classic (XP) view.  I rely quite a bit on the RESEARCH task pane and I don't mind telling you that it was difficult to find.  The menu bar is a bit on the thin side and having so many icons on the top added clutter and confusion, at least for me.  Of course, finding the research task pane could have been quickly resolved if Microsoft had put a product manual in the box (yes, the online HELP is nifty but sometimes a man just needs to read about it from a manual instead of printing it out).All in all you will find all of your old favorites.  And, true to the Office legacy, they really have not changed enough to warrant a major release but I'm willing to bet that after all is said and done, Office Ultimatae 2007 will become the industry standard
I'm a PC mechanic. I have been using Ad-Aware with Ad-Watch (now called Ad-Aware Plus) for the last 5 years.  It's pretty good at what it does, but there is newer technology that is going to replace it soon.I've never had any problems with these program - it does NOT add any malware - it REMOVES it.However, using Ad-Aware and Ad-Watch to their fullest does take some computer savvy - as it seems does any anti-malware on the market these days.ALL of the other runtime problems the other reviewers here have reported are "fixable" by using the controls and tweaks in the software, so that you are not overprotecting your system - one example, the pop-up blocker in Ad-Watch is adjustable as to its intensity.  However, this requires changing TWO settings - one in Ad-Watch itself and one in Ad-Aware.  And, yes, at times, I have had to turn Ad-Watch off to download a file or see a popup I wanted.  Soooo?  Software these days is not as "automatic" as the companies would have you believe.  If you're not willing to take the time to learn (which also means going to the company's online user forums and asking questions), just stick with what Windows offers, don't use Outlook or Outlook Express (major source of malware on PCs) and only look at websites you know are safe.  (Kinda like the safest form of sex is abstinence - the safest form of surfing is NONE!!!
For more than a year now, I have been using Ad-Aware. I love it. The program scans for spyware, adware, hijackers, keyloggers, and common trojans (but Norton is the one that takes out the trojans).So far, I am happy with this product. Even though I have never had anything bad on my computer (just cookies...mmm, cookies), my friend sure has had his share with MiniBug, Axela, eZula, FunWebProducts, and some others, and Ad-Aware completely removes it. And it does it all for free (yes, you can get the personal version free at Lavasoft's website).So what's something that Ad-Aware Personal doesn't do? Real-time. You'll notice on the personal version that if you click on Ad-Watch to enable Real-Time, it will state "Realtime protection not avaliable in the personal edition.". So, I checked out the plus edition.So, I did a test on an old computer, and installed eZula. That's right, it didn't go through. Right when it reached, an Ad-Aware pop-up stated "eZula was found at C:/(whatever). Would you like to remove?". Wow! Amazing!One thing that is doesn't do is block most pop-ups. This is dissappointing, mainly because competetors like SuperAdBlocker/SuperAntiSpyware has a great pop-up blocker along with everything Ad-Aware has. But, SuperAdBlocker doesn't have real-time, and Ad-Aware does. I'd recommend getting both.For now, if the computer is in a school, hotel, or airport of such, getting the plus edition wouldn't be a bad idea. But if you just use it for home, just keep the free personal edition. There aren't that many spyware programs that do things virus do, but I HAVE SEEN SOME that restart computers and add odd programs, such things trojans do. Though, for now, if you're not using this for public use, just have Ad-Aware Personal SE. If this is for public use, this is a great idea, and you may also want to get SuperAdBlocker for extra spyware protection and an excellent advertisement blocker (hell, now that I think of it, even if you have adware and SuperAdBlocker, it will block the adware), and Norton or McAfee for viruses or trojans (actally, every computer needs Norton or McAfee, unless it's a Mac or something).As for Ad-Aware, it's an excellent program, and it's highly recommended. Maybe in feature editions, maybe well see a pop-up/banner/flash blocker that SuperAdBlocker/SuperAntiSpyware has
Good modeling tool with great 3-D graphics which allows the user to view from any direction. The component selection is adequate and the tutorial was informative allowing me to get started designing within the first hour of installing the product
Don't get confused by the licensing mumbo jumbo that comes on the package. It is the full version ready to be installed. Don't forget to plan out your disk partitioning strategy before you start. So far, I have not noticed a dime's worth of difference from the Pro version. It is working great.However, the Vista coupon shipped with my package expired on March 15, 2007. Additionally, the coupon only applied to new systems purchased between October 26, 2006 and March 15, 2007, so don't let the Vista thing induce you
Don't listen to all that crap about how you should get Linux or buy a Mac instead of buying Windows. That will probably be the dumbest choice in your life. This is the full version of windows OEM software. Comes with activation code and Vista upgrade coupon to either Vista Home Basic or Home Premium. Bought from Tiger Direct through amazon.
My daughter loves Sims so I got this to help her improve her Spanish.  It is fun to play for adults, too.  The complete immersion method is more effective for learning a new language
When I tried this program out, I at first had some trouble running it. But Then I went to the website at: www.kutoka.com and click on the support tab and then select EasySpeak Spanish. They give you a link for the version of Flash 8 you need to run. After this everything worked well.While some may have been offended by bathing suits. Not me and not my kids. There is absolutly nothing obscene here folks. This program is the best thing going for learning spanish quickly! And it is fun to use with the many games and puzzles that you work out with real life scenerios. Very artistic and fun. You can go to the bank, the hospital, and several different places, learn a new set of words and situations. that you could really use in a foreign country. My hats off to the designers and creators of this program. Well done!! Bravo! Muy Bien. 
This product is amazing. After learning my husband was taking me to Mexico for our 25th anniversary, I was nervous about going into a foreign country without knowing any Spanish. This game is amazing. It is the fastest way to learn a language without the long drawn out grammar explanations. Afterall, I just wanted to learn the basics, phrases for restaurants, banks, airports, shopping etc. This game was so much fun, you couldn't tear me or my husband off the computer. We kept wanting to play because learning was so much fun. The phrases I learned contributed to a much more enjoyable trip and now I have enrolled at the local community college to further my Spanish. This product is perfect for any one travelling and wanting to learn the phrases and colloquial expression fast
What a wonderful game - addictive and motivating! If you want to be able to make original sentences, you might need something more in depth with a bit more grammar, but for "Eazy Speak" this is right on the target! Fun for any computer user!Looking for Spanish curriculum for younger kids? Try Flip Flop Spanish which has a CD with the writable workbook
The product appears to be informative and reasonably easy to use.  It is very helpful just describing the issues that need to be addressed.  Provides for addressing some stuff we might rather ignore or avoid
I have not yet looked at all the documents included in this software. I appreciate the tutorial nature and the pro/con examples given. Since I am not a lawyer, I am a bit nervous about making legal decisions that would need a test in court to be sure I made the correct choices. I did complete the HealthCare Directive and it compares well with others I've seen used in my state. I need to learn more about estate planning and this is going to teach me the jargon and the proper questions to ask.My only complaint is that I declined the free delivery option and paid for delivery so I would have enough time to work with it before my parents appointment with their estate attorney.  It did not arrive in a timely manner and I was forced to purchase a download version from another vendor in order to complete forms I wanted the attorney to look at.  It is no surprize that he was more interested in drawing up his own forms for my parents and charging $1000 for a basic package.I decided to keep the CD anyway (when it finally arrived) just in case I have a hard drive failure. 
This software is easy to use. It's like tax software, it ask questions, you answer. Has everything I wanted it for and a lot more. I would recommend it.Cheaper than a lawyer
This software offers simple and easy to use way of getting ones affairs in order
The lawsuit mentioned in Mr John Matlock "Gunny" review has nothing to do with the quality or legality of documents created using Quicken WillMaker Plus software. Instead, it concerns the actions of an insurance agent who was found to have practiced law without a license. He used will-making software (not Quicken WillMaker Plus) to write a willfor an elderly client. The trouble arose because he created the will outside of her presence and arranged for her to sign it while she was hospitalized. Apparently she never reviewed the will. In other words, he acted too much like a lawyer. While the "unauthorized practice of law" is a vague concept, had the insurance agent merely recorded the woman's wishes and entered them verbatim into the software, there would almost certainly have been no problem.There is no problem with using software to prepare a will for your self. Nor is there a problem with using it to create a will for someone else if you merely type in that person's answers at their direction. The main way to run afoul of unauthorized-practice-of-law rules is to give legal advice to or prepare documents for others without their express, detailed instructions.
There are several real advantages to using Quicken Willmaker software. 1. The legal part of the software was done by Nolo. They publish an awful lot of do-it-yourself software, and are well respected (if you are not a lawyer). Nolos involvement helps to assure me of a quality product. 2. The user interface, a fill in the blank approach with a lot of help screens, make the whole process quite easy and painless to go through. 3. Besides the standard last will, the package includes a number of other documents that you may want decide you need. Among others this includes Living Trust, Living Will, Final Arrangements, Notice to Terminate Joint Credit Card Accounts, Child Care Agreement  instructions, and many more. Having said that, there are two problems with the software: 1. If you live in Louisiana, your laws are based on the French system, not the English system and there is a caution on the box that says: 'Estate planning documents not valid in Louisiana.' 2. There has been at least one law suit saying that if you fill out the will for another person, you may be practicing law without a license. Do a Google search on 'Heirs sue over will-making software' where someone apparently used this software to do a will for a lady.
I have created two living wills/Power of Attorney for medical with attachments thru this program and have found it quite satisfactory.  It appears to be inclusive of the items I wanted to cover.
I just used this program to make wills and healthcare directives for my wife and me. I have the book-CD version. I recommend it over just the CD, because it is a better financial deal, and you do not have to read a PDF online or print it out.Here are some of the features that I thought were worth noting:* The program divides a document into sections and shows you a list of those sections, indicating which sections you have done. You can resume the interview at the beginning of any section and make changes from that point on.* After doing one will, you can go to the File menu and Save for Spouse. This creates a copy of the will with the spouses names interchanged. Then you can go through the interview and make any needed changes.* In the process of answering the questions, the program accumulates the names of people you mention into an editable contact list. After you mention someone once, the next time you need them you can simply select them from a list. This is handy when doing the healthcare directive, which needs to show contact information, if you have already entered that information when doing the will. It is also handy if you decide to redo portions of either document. When working on one family member's document, you can import contacts from another's document.* The program does not appear to provide the option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named. The only way to list two or more alternate executors is to have two or more of them serve together. This is ironic, since the program recommends having only one executor at a time. Although I wanted to name my wife, children, and then siblings as alternate executors, I decided to accept just having my wife and son as executor and alternate. If all of us die in an auto accident while taking a trip together, then there is hopefully time for the probate court to name an executor. It would just be more expedient to have one already named.* I contacted customer support asking them to enhance the program to add an option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named. The response stated why they chose to omit that option ("The editors choose to limit the number of fields for Beneficiaries and Executors to prevent the program from becoming to unwieldy") and some options (export the document and add the language or return the program). I was disappointed that they did not embrace my suggestion (I disagreed that it would make the program too unwieldy, since they already allow you to list multiple Beneficiaries and Executors that serve together at the same time), but I liked that I received a prompt response that indicated they had read my note and knew what I was talking about, and that they gave an honest, direct answer.* At the end of the interview you can review the document as it will print. You can then print it directly to a printer, or export it as plain text or RTF. Exporting to RTF is handy if you need to change the document (they advise against changing it) or print it somewhere else. However, the RTF is not identical to printing directly. I noticed two differences. (1) Pagination can be different, and as explained by the program, getting the pagination right is important for legal reasons. (2) The footer is always different: the directly printed copy says how many total pages, whereas the RTF one does not. If you cannot print directly to a printer, I recommend printing to a PDF to maintain the pagination and other features. If you do not have a way to create a PDF, get a free PDF Writer (search on that term). When you print the document to PDF, print it as prepress so you embed the fonts.
Absolutely no trouble installing on 2 computers,(I use Windows XP)!! Total Protection, plus you can block many websites very easy, which is great for the computer the kids use. Came with 3 licenses
I was using other internet security programs in the past. All had their pros and cons. I decided to switch to PC-Cillin 2006 Home Security Pack and it is the best available!.  It has both virus and spyware protections built in. The scanning is quick and the updates are easy to get. Plus this home security 3 pack is able to be installed on 3 computers, a bargain. All in all I am sold on this easy to use and comprehensive software product. I highly recommend this product to all! Amazon.com as usual had the best price
First I would like to state that sooner or later every computeruser will come in contact with some problem with an InternetSecurity program. They are human made and not 100% fault proof.I study and work in the IT field and was first introduced toPC-cillin through Trend Micro's product Housecall. Soon after Itried out the trial and have finally bought the product. I LOVEIT!I have used several of the other "major" anti-virus suitesavailable and have had tons of problems with them. McAfee afterone uninstall had bedded itself so far into the computer that Ihad to completely reformat the PC to gain functionality again.Norton to say wasn't much better.If you are installing on a "clean" PC where these other softwaresuites have not been, I have not had a problem. I haveinstalled/uninstalled PC-cillin many times each time runningsmoothly.The software has been a valuable asset protecting my PCs byalerting me to virus threats and even hacking threats that werenot even on my network but on my ISPs network. As well asprotecting my network from one single computer that received avirus by shutting off traffic to that PC. I can understand where some of the other problems reported withthis software may occur if the person a beginning user or justunfamiliar with the framework of the software. But if you alreadyhave some experience in how to set this type of software up Ireally do recommend you give PC-cillin a try. It is a sleak program, easy to install, easy to customize, andreally goes above and beyond with alerting you to possible risksand threats. With all its competitors out there I would choose PC-cillin overthe rest any day of the week
I've used several other protection packages over the years and am please to say that last year found trend micro.  Their internet protection is imho the best.  Easy to install, doesn't eat up system resources, updates regularly, doesn't conflict with other programs.Currently installed on 6 systems and I have no complaints at all, only praise
I had to start version 9 without the user files from version 7.  Even without the user files version 9 more quickly adapts to my needs.  I can dictate faster and there are fewer mistakes.  This reduces the time it requires for me to write a letter or produce a document.  For these reasons I'm quite satisfied with the purchase
This is a perfect office suite for those who don't need all the new stuff that is available in office 2007. Outlook appears to be working great without some of the hang-ups in earlier additions. Probably more stuff in here than most people need, but it is easy to use and has some great enhancements
I am very pleased with the product - I had trouble with my system and Microsoft tech support was outstanding on helping me solve the issues
Microsoft Office Pro 2003 edition is a good product. It installed easily over Office Pro 1997. I haven't had any problems with it (yet). It relies heavily on online links, you probably should have a fast DSL connection or broadband if you are going to use the online links.Update:I am using Windows XP with Office Pro 2003 and today was disappointed to find that the Help menu is not as user friendly or helpful as earlier editions
I was happy enough with the function of Office XP, and held off upgrading for a long time.  What pushed me over was when I switched to using Outlook as my email client, accessing quite a few POP3 email accounts for various websites.  Getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty: I spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working.Well, Office 2003's Outlook comes with it's own spam filter.  It works, it's simple and it's unobtrusive.The other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles, but the upgrades I appreciate most are in Outlook
It would be nice if the contents were listed, with all of Microsoft's versions, it gets confusing
The layout of Office 2003 is better than Office 2003, which has improved my efficiency.  For those who spend all day working with the Outlook package, it's worth the money to upgrade
I love this especially for it's basic qualities.  I originally started with the version where it could be put on a 1.44 floppy that I got from my dentist, went to version 2001 a few years later. With version 2001 my bank no longer would support downloads for that it, and I knew I would have to upgrade some time.  I was comfortable with 2001 so I was glad to find this 2007 was easy to adapt to just a bit sleeker but adding my ability to download from my bank once again.  For someone who doesn't have the need for all the extras this is perfect
very easy to follow - especially if you've used Quicken in the past. Reports are set up just a little bit different - total at top of category instead of bottom, so you need to get accustomed to that; overall great produc
(Review written by my wife, the user.)I've happily used the Quicken Checkbook program for many years.  When we changed operating systems from Windows XP to Windows Vista, I was unable to get the Quicken 2002 version to work in Vista, so I purchased Quicken Basic 2007 and am totally pleased with the program.  The only feature I use is the Checkbook program and as far as I'm concerned, it's perfect.  I've never used the download from bank option because I prefer to review all posted transactions when the bank statement arrives. I use Edit Preferences feature to tailor the program to my liking and I couldn't be happier.  The price is reasonable, too
Great for managing your basic accounts and finances.  Easy to use.  Worth the price.  Interacts well with online banking services
For a basic money management software, this product met my expectations.  No frills but very easy to use.  Convenient calendar of payments and scheduled payments showing my balance after each transaction.  I set my account up in 20 minutes.  There isn't a manual but for the price and ease of use, I don't need one
When my last computer got zapped by lightning the one thing I missed the most was being able to balance my check book. Glad to be back on track. I like the new look
If you find iMovie complicated, this product is not for you.  If you prefer automatic quick solutions this product may not be for you.  If you find that you would like more control of your video/audio than you find in iMovie but don't want to spend a lot of money, boy have you come to the right place.I take quite a lot of home video (new baby and all) and found that iMovie would frustrate me when I couldn't do some more advanced tasks.iMovie is a great intro product.  If you are new to video, use it until you find that you feel limited (many will never will get to that point).When (and if) you find that you feel some constraints in iMovie, then move up to FCE.A note for most, iMovie and FCE typically are not for DVD/Hard Drive camcorders.  They don't have the output necessary to directly connect.  You may want to check with your camcorder manufacturer to see what they have to convert the DVD/HD to content that is usuable in these products
I use this with a MacBook laptop with 2GB RAM without any performance issues. It is a great product for when you have outgrown iMovie but don't need the full feature set of Final Cut. I use it for both perosnal and work video production. No problems connecting and moving video of a Panasonic PV-GS500 video camera via Firewire. There is a learning curve but the basics are pretty easy to master.
This was given to my son who is going to be living in China this summer and presently knows no Chinese.  He's worked hard with this program and at least appears to be getting the tonal quality correct which is key in this language.  A microphone is a must with this program.  Only wish it focused on certain key words other than phrases that would never be used, like "an old man driving a car"
4 different methods to learn the language, I am able to do 2 lessons an evening one to repeat and one new. The only thing you have to do is sit in fron of the computer. Just listen and look and the key words will pop out at you and you just can not help but to learn the new language.Very user friendly
This map and trip maker is about the same as their previous versions except to my dislike, it no longer supports Windows 98, which happens to be the newest OP that my old lap top can use.  It also still lists some restaurants that have been closed for two years.  The street maps it produces are accurate, except for a few minor glitches
The program is great.  Sometimes the GPS is slightly off though.  I'll be travelling on a major highway and all of the sudden it will tell me that I'm off route for no reason.  Not really a big deal, just annoying.  Other than that I recommend it as a cheaper version of a GPS sysytem if you own a laptop
This is the second generation of this software I have owned.  It is a great navagation tool, better than most online sites and can be used in the car.I marvel at how up to date the roads shown are because in the Lexington, Kentucky area we have had a lot of new growth, with new streets and roads.The software contains a lot of good eating and lodging places already placed on the map, so you don't have to do a separate search to find a place to eat or spend the night. Major points of interest are also on the map
I use my Microsoft Streets and Trips software to plan my route, intermediate stops, and destination for any travel via automobile or truck.  I am especially pleased with the ability to see and print a detailed guide for locating street addresses for those destinations with which I may be unfamiliar.  This is especially helpful for delivery of items to a customer whose business may be on a relatively remote street in areas that are difficult to find.I have tried a few other software systems that claim to do what Streets and Trips does, and I found none of those sustems could equal or even compete with Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007
I have used this product for the last three years and I am very satisfiedwith it and recommend it highly
This was the only place I could find Turbo Tax where I did not have to pay extra for state tax.  I live in Washington and we do not have state income tax.  I even asked Intuit how to get a version without the state tax, they said that was not possible.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I will buy from Amazon again next year.Too bad some people can not read and then blame someone else for problems they caused.  Sound like a couple of 5 year olds.The only down side for me I received an email from amazon saying shipment would be delayed 15 days.  2 days later the software arrivied, right on the day amazon originally said it should.  Don't know why they sent the 15 day delay email
I find Turbo Tax to be the original and best income tax preparation program.  I really saddened to hear people knock it on here because they felt cheated that this version doesn't come with State tax features.  Well, if you are going to shop online, you'd better learn to read the specifications for products!  I came to Amazon precisely because I knew I'd be able to find what I needed, for less.  Texas has no State income tax, so I make sure that I buy Turbo Tax for Federal only.  Thanks for letting me get that little rant off my chest
I've used TurboTax (or MacInTax in the early days) for over 15 years to do my taxes. Most of those years included some form of business income, requiring a Schedule C to be filed. TurboTax Home and Business is a terrific product, taking you from gathering documents, to educating you about the tax code and recent changes, to data entry, to electronic filing. It's the whole package.One year, we used an accountant to prepare our taxes, because of a particularly unusual income situation with complicated tax implications. In the amount of time that it took me to write down by hand all the information requested on the accountant's form, I could have typed everything into TurboTax and had my taxes filed. Plus, TurboTax is less than the $250 average tax preparation bill. And that year I really missed the tax education I usually get by going step-by-step through TurboTax, giving me tax saving strategies for the following year.Faster. Cheaper. Plus tax strategy education. That's why I'm using TurboTax again this year.P.S. There's no income tax for my state, so getting the Federal Only version is saving me $10. Thank you, Intuit, for splitting that apart and giving me the option
It was an excellent purchase. Fast ans efficient receipt of goods and fine quality
its a good software, it works good and keep the computer safe from spam, virus, and some others malware, try it
I bought Adobe Acrobat 8.0 Professional for home use after having used an older version at work.  The software was very easy to install, activate, and register; and I liked the orientation program that explained how to use the features.  Since I am active with three community service organizations, I welcome the addition to my home computer for the convenience it adds to assembling mixed media "binders." This program makes it easier to email formal reports, create handbills and pamphlets, and post them to my web page. 
At first I had some difficulty adjusting to the new interface. Once I got used to it though I find it a lot more useful and comfortable to operate.It's a great step forward in all senses for Acrobat!!
It's quite a bit slower than version 7.  But it looks really good and the form designer has been improved by leaps and bounds
We found the program to be easy to install and the lessons easy to retrieve. The lessons are presented in a variety of ways to accomodate one's learning style.  The accompanying text is not difficult to understand and is very helpful in explaining the basics of the program. We appreciate the repetition and the spiraling effect used as one progresses through the lessons. So far, we are pleased with the materials and have felt quite successful in learning some basis phrases.
Drills are excellent, vocabulary has good variety... Picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me, but I guess that's the way kids learn any language.
I am fluent in Spanish. So, the Rosetta Stone Italian language software, was perfect for me. It is very easy to understand, to follow and to learn. If you study one hour per day, in one week you are going to remember several words and phrases. I don't have any regret at all, I think my investment was worthwhile.
great product, simple to use, after short training from accountant, it is in and running
I was a little diappointed when I found out that I would have to buy more versions to get continued training on this subject.
I had the same problem with Works Suite 2002 that I had with 2006.  The product key that came with the discs would not install Microsoft Word;  the message "invalid product key" came up.  After a computer problem, I reformatted the drive and did a reinstall from the original Works 2002 discs. The invalid key message showed up when I tried to install Word 2002.  After arguing with Microsoft people for three weeks I bought the new Works Suite 2006.  After running all the discs to a clean hard drive, everything worked except,again,the invalid key message came up and wouldn't activate Word. Highly irritating.  I got it going by to Microsoft Works, Programs, clicked Word Document, got an "activate product" and got Word installed and running. This seems to be a dumb glitch in the software
I have been a Word Perfect user for years, but found I could not open files that were received from professional organizations and Attorneys.  That was the reason for purchasing Microsoft Works.  This has been a great asset for our business.  Thank yo
Works work, what cam I say. I have been using microsoft products for years. Quality easy to use products are the reason they are a software giant.
Understand. I have a full MS New Office Suite that I got from work.   But choose to use this product for the many items included which can't be beat. If you just want to use Word and nothing else then get it alone. This is fine. But the other products are worth the discount and rebate also. Cost is the lowest I found. If you have a reward ceriticate using Amazon Credit card. That $25 more off the price. So in the end it cost me $30 for it. Shop smart and use any break you could get. Right?
When I got a new computer at the end of 2001, the 2002 edition was installed on my computer by Gateway. Although I never used Streets and Trips (and barely used Encarta), I used Word and Picture It! quite heavily.Well, my hard drive died a few weeks ago, and I had to get a new computer. I bought Microsoft Works Suite 2006 to go with it. I was a bit apprehensive because Picture It! was replaced with Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006 Editor. It took me a while to get fluent in Picture It!, and the idea of learning a new photo system was daunting. (I write mostly for the web, and use pictures to accompany my reviews and articles--as well as for eBooks.)I haven't done any extensive work with it yet, but it appears easy to use IF you have experience with Picture It! If you've never used any image program before, it may be a bit confusing. (I feel that Picture It! was more self-explanatory.)However, for all that the Works Suite gives you, I feel it's a good buy. Word 2002 has advantages over the older version (for example, you can easily insert images), and Encarta may be helpful for kids doing homework (or curious adults wanting to learn more about something).Updating Encarta is easy as clicking a mouse: just open up the program and click "Update Encarta". New articles and updates will automatically be added to your computer. Although I *still* don't use Streets and Trips (I go to MapQuest reflexively), I still think this is a great Suite for a great price
I use MS Office at work, and at home, but for my daughter's computer this was perfect. Most people don't need the full version of office, and this package has so much for so little money.The full version of Word is reason enough to spend this amount of money. Note: This is not the latest version, but who cares.I would say this is one of the best software deals out there. Unless you need 100% office compatiblity, this is the package for you. If you do, buy the student and teacher version of MS Office. Read the fine print, it is for anyone not using it for business
It seems no longer possible to buy MS Word as a stand-alone program so to get it one buys Microsoft Works Suite.  This way one gets Word one version back from the most current version - plus Encarta, Streets and Trips, etc.  When purchasing be sure to distinguish between the CD version and the DVD version.  The latter comes on a single disk; the former on about six.  Also, note this is not the same as Microsoft Works - a suite of programs often preloaded on a new computer.  It has its own "peculiar" word processor, spreadsheet, etc.  For more than Word, look for the Student and Teacher Edition of MS Office Suite
This software is wonderful! I have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years. I've tried Broderbund (sp?) whose interface was too clumsy, Nova which was rather difficult at times (many things you can't do) and now this. When I first took this out of the package and installed it I thought I had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very, very few backgrounds, templates or embellishements even when I opened the Xtras CDs that came with this. I truly did not feel the Xtras CDs were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them. But then I found the tutorials that are included on the CD and watched the one about making collages. I didn't get halfway through the video - I had figured out how to do it. I have now created some of the best scrapbook pages I've ever made. Within hours I had a beautiful collage/letter to send with my holiday cards. My husband's first impression was a heartfelt "It's lovely". What has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that I can take ANY image and make it a background, I can create and manipulate text almost any way I want, I've been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it (.png format). I feel like I have no limitations on what I can do now. I imagine this software is not as sophistacated as Adobe Illustrator, but then it probably isn't as complicated to use (from what I remember that program has a rather steep learning curve).You can also use the eyedropper tool to "pick up" any color from any picture, background, or element (read "anything") in the program. I was able to take the background colors and make embellishments that matched! I can take a color from one of my pictues and make a background that matches. You can also remove backgrounds from photos - it takes a bit of time to do, but the area around the image will be transparent - this functionality has many uses.  You can also save your files in many different formats including .jpg for file sharing, etc. There are so many more features I couldn't possibly list them here, nor would you want me too (too much time). If you only use premade templates and don't feel ready to venture out on your own yet this software may not be for you unless you find a website that sells templates for this software. You could start with something like Nova Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 3.0, which I liked, and when you start becoming really frustrated by its limiations it may be time to move up to this program. You may also want to read a book about digital scrapbooking to give you ideas and alert you to possibilities. The great thing about this program is that it isn't just for scrapbooking. You can do all your photo manipulation in it . I have always liked Paint Shop Pro so much that I haven't been able to afford to upgrade my copy since version 6, but I kept using that version. I'm so glad I got version 10 as it is very user friendly too. But please know that version 10 (which comes with this package) is not the most recent version. Version 11 is out now. If you don't want/need the Xtras CDs that come with this package you may want to just buy the most recent version and buy some embellishements from a website that makes .png files (portable network graphics format) or make your own. I hope you have as much fun with this software as I am having. I highly recommend the training videos on the CD - they really help
I am finding that it is not so diffucult to navigate my way around the new programs of Excel, Word etc. Opening up files - it tends to be a bit sluggish.  On the plus side I found Word 2007 seems to do a much better job of lining up indents.  In Word 2003 our indents were sometimes off by a half space which bothered us. 
Office 2007 was a very nice improvement over previous versions.  The program was stable, for me at least, and the new interface was very nice.  It may take a few minutes to find where some commands have been moved to but the result was a much cleaner interface.  One thing that keeps in mind is that it uses a different file format from previous versions by default.  There is the option of changing the format to the previous version but the default option isn't compatible with earlier programs
Wow! I must say that the new office 2007 is way better than the 2003. It did take some time to get the hang of it because Microsoft changed around the icons and buttons. However, I do like it because now in Word, Excel, and Powerpoint 2007 you can creat charts and you can also preview how backgrounds look before appling to the slide. In the end, I think the 2007 is much more user-friendly than 2003. I recomend to anyone to buy this product if they wish to upgrade to the NEW 2007 Microsoft Office
If you're looking for a professional office suite, MS Office 2007 has no real competitors. I've worked extensively with Corel Office and some with Open Office. They're fine for the basics, and they cost less. But if you're looking for effectiveness, integration, speedy productivity, and an incredible array of tools, you'll want to buy MS Office 2007. And as an added bonus, the interface makes it a pleasure to work in
A quick look at the first several tutorials had me up and running.  I've been able to do most of the things I've wanted to do with this program and it's delivered on most of its promises.  My wife loves it too.I have to remind myself that I'm not an architect and this isn't a professional program, though.  It does most things really well but it has some short comings.I'm trying to draw my house right not which is a 4 level and haven't had any luck yet.  Although I've net seen all tutorials, I'm doubtful the program can do it at all.  Foundations have been difficult to manipulate at best.My planned home addition includes a home theater and I've had to use work-arounds to get risers and sound insulated walls.  (Which messes up my already difficult to use cost estimator.)  But it has let me put in chairs, speakers, and a projector screen which makes the 3D views very close to what the finished product may look like.The framing view is a dud as it appears to serve no practicle purpose.So as long as you have realistic expectations from the program it should make you very happy.  Basic functions are easy to learn and my wife and I've had a blast planning our addition.  I can't imagine designing our addition/remodel without it.I would buy it again
I have used other product of this kind and have never used any easier one.  The video tutorials are the greatest help of all.  The home plans they already have in the program are lacking but you can change them to what you want, but that is not the easiest task.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their dreams come true
I bought BHG Deluxe 7.0 software to plan an addition. I talked to the companies and shopped around before purchasing. I did not talk to IMSI about floor plan 3D, I gave up after trying to get through to a human. I would bet a guess the software is as good as IMSI's telephone skills. I talked to Punch Software and was warned away from their product by their own tech as I have integrated video on my computer. Apparently you need a video card with a minimum of video memory to render drawings with any usable speed using punch software. Punch Software's loss, not mine as that's a ridiculous issue for a consumer software product. Chief Architect offered a money back guarantee for their Better Homes and Gardens products, even if purchased via vendors like amazon. I'll keep this better homes and gardens home designer deluxe software, even though it does have it's annoying quirks. Even for a lesser package from the pro version, the library of items it very limited. I would guess there are quite a few more in the pro version, but it is odd to not include more of the most standard items that many home owners would need when laying out a home. You learn to just use a nearly matched symbol to fill the space, even though it is not the correct symbol or size of item. Since I am not interested in the 3D view, this is not a big issue for me. The item I needed most was floorplanning. 3D modeling is an extra item that I may play with, but is not essential for me personally. If you are truly interested in the 3D aspect, this is an issue. I would recommend visiting the product forum to see what is the best choice. [...]  For quick and easy floor plan software with a few extras, this software does better than OK. No experience necessary, and the short tutorial videos will get you started quickly. I have issues with not being able to have more control of wall types, and there are some odd roof design limitations even for a mid to low priced consumer package. These are annoying enough to urge an upgrade to pro if you want more  control of all aspects. Since I will be laying out the floor plan, then turning it over to an architect with real softare, it's not a problem for me. I have had a few restarts due to drawings getting all wild and messed up, but by ignoring the autosaved drawings, I was able to go back to my last manually saved drawing and start from a known good point. This software does have upgrade options to download from the company site. Just like any good software company, they do provide spftware patches to download. I would definately recommend this software as a quick way to do floor plans. Adding walls, doors, windows, and other items is very simple. Just don't plan on perfection, as it's based on prefabbed walls and is limited to whole inches, not fractions. Angles are an issue as well. If you need specific angles, this is not the package, it does preset increments only. I wish it had default preferences a user could select as well. Being able to preset your roofing style preferences or other items would eliminate quite a bit of redo's. I hope the software companies read these reviews. There is alot of good information on how to improve the products.    
Really neat program and it may be a tad over my head right now.  The tutorial is helping a great deal.  I am positive that I will find all the right buttons
I love this program!!! it is so great to see the dimensions, wall colors, decorating ideas at my fingertips
The engine behind this program is from Chief Architect, who, from what I understand, are developers of professional CAD software. It shows in this program. While this program has one of the best 3D walk around and capabilities, I tend to judge this and others by the drawing tools that it possesses. And this one has some good usable tools. Like most consumer level landscaping programs, this one has photo import so you can design around an actual photo of your home. Unlike other programs, the BHG software allows you to import and mask your own plant images. This is a great feature that my own program has which gives much better visualization with plants you might actually use. All the important stuff that we need to create a sellable visual landscape is there. For now, and with the choices I know of that are available to you, I find this to be the best consumer level landscape and garden program out there. This design software comes with an easy to understand tutorial CD. It was easy to install and start using right away. I think most folks would do quite well with this one. 
I'm 9 years old and play this game frequently. I love to play it. It's not frustrating at all and it's totally exciting with many adorable animals. I didn't like her wardrobe in the beginning but then I bought a dresser and changed her outfit. The Pigs are fun to treat!!!!! They're smart!! The rabbits are soft and adorable; having my favorite animal being rabbits. I play this game for at least a half an hour a day and can't wait for the next time playing it!!!!Get this game and try it out!! It's the best!
I did have to adjust my graphics acceleration to get the game to run smoothly, but it's a fantastic game. You get a building with your waiting room, exam room, living room, and bedroom. You build animal pens outside, buy medical equipment, buy books to learn about caring for each species, and need to manage your time to make sure you examine animals, sleep, eat, and for all animals that require a hospital stay you need to feed, care for, play with, and clean up after. It's a fun and well designed game
I have my own ATI primium TV tuner card so I tried the trial version on this software. But I realized that once one software is using a TV Tuner Card, it is difficulty to use the same device for other applications.So, I purchased the full version of MY-IPTV which came with a USB 2.0 external device. So, I can also use it on my laptop notebook. I like this a lot.This company boasts the feature to watch TV away from home. But I was very happy that I can watch TV from any computer at home as long as I have MY-IPTV in one of my desktop or stationary PC.I would recommend this to folks who wathc TV on their PC or want to watch on PC like other techy guys out there.I guess this turns your LCD monitor into a LCD TV.
I'm very impressed with how non intrusive this software is.  I used Norton for approximately 5 years before I changed to Bit Defender.  I didn't realize how bogged down my system was until I made the change.  The system scan is very quick (approx. 8-10 minutes in comparison to 20-25 minutes from Norton).  I don't even notice when the software is updating.  I'm very pleased with the program thus far and I highly recommend it
Installed quickly and with no problems. Does not slow the machine down as much as Norton antivirus.
When my virus protection was about to expire, I was in a quandary.  I wasn't at all happy with the Norton I had purchased last year.  And, I wasn't especially pleased with the McAfee I had used the year before that.  When I checked the local stores, there didn't seem to be anything else to choose from.  I checked Amazon and found more options, plus plenty of customer comments to help me decide.  My son told me that BitDefender had been given the highest rating by Consumer Reports.  That, together with other customer comments on Amazon, helped me decide to give it a try.  So far, I'm delighted with its performance.  In fact, when I first installed it, it found a virus and some suspicious cookies that Norton never caught.  It doesn't appear to be interferring with my system operations (unlike Norton and McAfee), it and doesn't constantly interrupt with pop-ups and unnecessary warnings.  The best thing is that it gives me two years of protection for the price of one year with the other guys
The last reviewer didn't see any point to this software. Partially that's true---you don't need it to create your photostamp, you can do the same thing online. However, there is one big plus to the software product: buying a single sheet of PhotoStamps direct from their website costs $24.99 + $2.99 shipping, at this writing. In contrast, Amazon is selling this "boxed" version ---which includes a free voucher for a single sheet of stamps---for seven bucks less than that. Do the math
I thought this product was easy to use and produced decent results.  It works better than some of the more expensive software; I have tried at least a half-dozen similar programs, but I keep returning to this bargain-bin favorite.  For the money, it is an excellent value. 
I can't believe this application. I bought it last year and I have 200 pages completed. I can truthfully say that I will never scrapbook the traditional way from this moment on. So fast and easy! I will be all up to date with my scrap booking for X-MAS '05. I am overjoyed. I don't believe I know anyone who scrapbooks traditionally anymore! Thanks for simplifying my life
I bought this to use with family photos and threw together my first 5 page comic last night.  It was fairly easy to use, but not perfect.  Instructions are thin (read 'mostly nonexistant'); so it is best that you either have time on your hand OR a lot of experience using complex photo software.GOOD:  Simple once you get the hang of it.  Plenty of fixed comic book panel formats to chose from and the drag-and-drop photo application makes life very easy.  As long as you are OK with the formats provided, then putting family photos into a fun comic book format is incredibly easy.  I received rave reviews from my first 'comic' and the finished product was of exceptional quality.  The sofware has a nice assortment of boxes, call-outs and even some fun clip art.  This was a great buy for the price.NOT AS GOOD: The learning curve can be steep due to the quirky layout of controls.  I guess this is not too bad of an issue since there are few controls provided with the software.  The "dude" who wrote instructions was flippant at best (really annoying if you want to find a basic answer) and definitely not paid to produce a quality product.  Downloading photos was tough until I found out the trick - after that, it is quite easy.  BAD: No photo editing software included.  Simple things like rotating photos 90 degrees had to be done prior to loading into Comic Book Creator.  The instructions and "Comic Book Wizard" are close to useless.  Did I mention the controls?  They are basic (good and bad) and poorly laid out (bad).  There is no ability to truly customize panel layouts; so this software will not help out if you want something really creative.  (Diagonals, overlays and more.)All-in-all, this was an excellent buy for a software package under $20.  I created a great storyboard format of some fun memories - bringing a great laugh (and a few "wows") to my family, grandparents and friends.  Just be aware that there is a learning curve to get over before you hit the fun stuff.  If the software was more expensive, then I would have given it 3 stars
Actually, Comic Book Creator lets you use your content in a million different ways, including reselling of your work.  The only limitation is that you can't sell comics created around branded content--like images from Marvel, Paramount, TOKYOPOP, etc.--because they don't allow that.  It's all in the user agreement.  Check it out
Don't expect to receive this by Christmas even though it says "in stock". I ordered this on Dec. 14th and just received word today, the 20th, that it is not expected to ship until the end of January, early February. So if you need it for a specific occasion, don't count on it getting there in time
I own this program and for 20 bucks, it's outstanding.  Depending on what you want to do, you need to know that there are limits though.  If you want to just drop screenshots from your PC Game and make your own story, it's awesome.  If you want to drop your own photos or mess with the provided clipart, you can do that with ease as well.  If you want to make your own comic with your own pictures, that can get a bit tricky.  You need an art program like Photoshop, or scan your own drawings into the computer and put them in the clipart folder.  Then you can use them as inserts into the panels or as clipart, which allows you to overlap the panels a bit for a semi professional layout.  I have been working on a 24 page comic for a couple months (I have a wife and kid so there are limits to my time) and it's coming out quite nicely.  Now granted, this is not going to get you any contracts or deals with publishers but it's fun.  And anyone who loves comics and has wanted to make one of their own come to life, this is the key.
Loaded easily, no glitches. the online account access feature became functional after running the software update. The program is fully functional and I have suffered no inconvenience running this on an Intel-based Macbook.
Most of the world still runs on PCs and as a Mac owner (and lover), it can be tough to find software for basic stuff like accounting.  I'm a guy who makes a living making stuff sound good for radio, TV, video games and so on.  As a freelancer, I need something to keep track of my business banking, credit cards, expenses and invoices and this program does just that and very intuitively, just like my Mac. I used MYOB--a Mac accounting program--but found it to be tricky and didn't end up with the comprehensive reports for my accountant that I expected and wound up going over everything expense by expense and invoice by invoice for hours.  It could be that I didn't understand the program well enough, but support is extra everytime you call customer service for help, so no thanks MYOB.  In fact, I put off doing most of my 2006 accounting until January 2007 because I dreaded trying to figure out MYOB again.  Then I broke down and bought Quickbooks for Mac.  It did everything I needed it to--a year's worth of accounting in a weekend and I never even cracked the manual.  It allowed me to save the year as a PC file to hand to my accountant on a CD.  A few days later he handed me back a CD with a Mac file of my adjusted accounting and my corp taxes were done and sent.  I can't speak for anyone with really advanced accounting needs because I never got that deep into the program, but for my needs it's right on the money.   
I'm currently learning how to use this product; however, one of the first things I noticed was that the only way to do my payroll with it was to use a SERVICE.  Now of course, this SERVICE wasn't free and with only 4 employees, the last thing I wanted to do was expend $20 a month on a SERVICE.  Wasn't that the point of getting Quickbooks - so I could do it myself?Now I can understand that tax codes, percentages, etc can vary from state to state, but would it have been so difficult for them to just set up a section with the generalized accounts and have the user input the amounts for each account needed on their payroll checks.  See, I'm not even asking them to have the computer calculate the amounts.  Simple would have been fine with me.As for the rest of the program, it looks as though it will be fairly easy to use after I figure out the best way to set it up for my particular business.I'm disappointed that a Business program designed for the small businessman would omit something as vital as payroll
Simply THE tool for getting your business put together.  It's able to do just about everything you'd ever want to do!!
I've only been using this program for about a month.  Its not a simple program for me, for i'm not business savvy.  With help of a CPA and the wonderful tutorials and help program, I'm getting the program and its working so well!I love it
I would recommand this software to anyone that burns DVD/CD. It is user friendly and easy to navigate
One of the best programs that I have to work with CD  DVD
I teach presentation skills, so I'm always on the lookout for things that make PowerPoint better.  I've tried and recommended other software in the past, but none of them have the power of Ovation.This is an outstanding piece of software.  The visual effects are stunning, and it's so easy to use that a child could learn it in a few minutes.  PowerPoint is boring, and everyone's presentations look the same.  Not any more!  Full-motion backgrounds and effects really jazz up your presentations, and they have over 100 professional-looking business themes available.  See their website (seriousmagic dot com) for a demonstration of what it can do.  All you have to do is drag and drop your PowerPoint presentation on the Ovation icon, choose a theme and the effects, and voila! - a new presentation!The current version 1.0 can not process embedded video or audio files, but they say that will be fixed with the first patch within the next month or two.  Despite that shortcoming, this is the best PowerPoint enhancement available - heads and shoulders above the competitors
MS put Office 2007 on a DVD rather than a CD so there is only one disk, so they make the installation easier right off the bat. Unlike all previous versions of Office, you do not have to get into the details of what options you want. In previous versions, if you didn't make sure you installed all the features, when you went to do a function that wasn't installed, you had to dig out your Office disks and install the feature. A huge pain, but not anymore.The installation is hands down the easiest of all versions of Office. You don't have to tell it manually where to find your files. You don't have to manually put in your favorite buttons. It's all done for you. Yes it takes some getting use to the new layout of the functions, but once you figure them out, it is so nice and smooth. This version is light years better than all previous versions.The most impressive part of the installation is Outlook 2007. In all previous versions, you had to EXPORT and IMPORT all your files and Contacts. Anyone who experienced this, knows that it never went that smooth. Sometimes it was awful and you lost emails and Contacts in the transfer, and the time it took to do this, was very painful. This is not the case with Outlook 2007. Just load the program and it does all the transfers  from your previous version of Outlook. You don't have to do a thing, and you're up and running without missing a beat when the program is done loading. You will be shocked how simple it is.Anything new has it's growing pains to learn, but once you do, you will be very glad you made the change
I've been using this since the first beta release, and it has sped up my productivity at work by miles.  The ribbon interface is more upfront with the commands most ofter used, and my old keystroke commands are still there as well.  After changing my default save setting to 97-2003 I have run into no compatibility problems.  As with most of the bad reviews on MS products, it seems people are quick to rush with a bad review when they are unable to find or do something as quickly as they have in the past.  My advice is to spend ten minutes looking through all of the menus...  They make sense, and once you get used to it, you'll never want to go back to the old way again.  Everything is cleaner, smoother, faster, and easier to use than ever before, and I have been using Office for longer than I care to admit.  Let go of the past people!  This is the future of business productivity
The new office 2007 is completely revamped from older versions and is well worth the four year wait.+'s1.New Interface with improved accessibility to all features, you can reach all the features that were hidden away inside those menus and no need to memorize the menu contents/options.2. If you are a developer you can write your own custom panes using Visual Studio.3. Great Plug-ins (like the save as PDF/XPS thing available as a free dwnld), massive clip-art/template library.-s1.Overpriced by about 40%. Somwhere around 250-300 wud have been the right price for the Pro Edition.2. Some backward compatability issues with the document formats and templates and doesn't work with Adobe Acrobat as of now
Other similar products were too complicated. All I wanted was something simple. I got exactly what I needed to convince myself I had my act together.  I found it in this product.  Big E-Z Bookkeeping helped me simplify my bookkeeping without the anxiety.  It's just enough for my family accounts.  Thank You
I have a new Compaq PC - AMD Athlon 64, 1/2-gig ram, 200+GB HDD - and NIS-2005 came pre-installed. It worked and continues to work fine for me - and I am able to get all my updates regularly w/o any problems. However I am a single desktop user with normal needs - not a power user. That, and if you have a high-end PC - then this product should be quite adequat
I am enjoying the Talk Now! Learn Bulgarian CD. Great images, repetitive visual and auditory instruction make learning the basic words, numbers, time, etc. easy. Also, the games add interest. You can print out each section with photos and words in Bulgarian. However, I would have liked to see the program come with the Cyrillic alphabet and pronunciation guide.
I purchased this product needing to work on a personal legal (nonbusiness) matter, so the noncommercial license was fine for my "home" use.  Good thing I checked with Corel after buying it and seeing the "Home Edition" captions not only on the total suite packaging but underneath the "WordPerfect" and "Quattro Pro" components (inside front box folding cover with velcro).  Corel ultimately confirmed to me that "certain components that are designed for the business customer, such as Legal Tools, MetaData Removal, Document Compare, Quickfinder to name a few are not included in the Home Edition version."  Corel needs to make this clearer in their marketing of the "Home Edition."  I focused on the word processing application, but the Quattro Pro application is also captioned as "Home Edition" so it may be missing some features available in the Quattro Pro included in other Suite versions (Standard, Pro, Student/Teacher, etc.).  The Home Edition may still be suitable for some users, but I'm a strong believer in "full disclosure."  WordPerfect itself is a great program.  Try setting point sizes with decimals in Word -- you can't.  Try changing the size of the font in legal pleadings in Word -- there's no direct control of it (the Microsoft site instructs you to change margins and number of lines per page to attempt to get Word to adjust the font size) [but remember, you need any WordPerfect version other than Home Edition to get Legal Tools]
There are a lot of good things about this software. The major pull-back is the learning curve, othervise it's a 5-star one. By the way, be sure to set the correct elevation of your house to start with, or you won't be able to change it once you put on walls, windows everything
This was my second purchase of a product like this and I loved it. The first one I tried was difficult to use. It was so easy to use. My husband and I were unsure of our remodeling plans and with this we were able to get a vision together of how our home would look once completed. It helped us pick everything from furniture location to color of carpet and flooring. My favorite feature was the Home Estimator feature that tracked our materials useage
I have purchased both the Home  Gardens interior and the Punch interior software. Home  Gardens is much easier to use. You can really start without reading much of the manual. Punch demands that you read the manual (342 pages). It is not intuative. But Punch can do so much more and has so much more creativity. IE: Punch has a library of trees, shrubs and flowers for your yard. Home  Gardens only have potted plants, nothing you can use to landscape. Punch also allows you to make custom doors or windows to your exact specifications. H doesn't. You have to choose a set style of door or window and change options.I also could place digital photos of my backyard behind my "house" on Punch to make it more realisitic. I like both software programs, but Punch has more options, but you have to do your homework first
Looked at them all and then bought this software... it can do a lot of things so, yes, it might take a bit to learn and get fast with. There is a reason it has been voted best for several years now. It does a good job if you remember the very old computer saying,"Garbage IN...Garbage OUT" 8-)  My wife loves the video tutorials that she can pop-up anytime she needs to without stopping the software and what she's working on.Anything this complete, is worth the learning curve
Amazing program! Definitely building my skills in the interior design field. Would recommend to anyone
I recently  purchased this software to redesign my bathroom and bedroom.  Compared to other products that I have evaluated, Punch! Interior Design Suite wins hands-down in the areas of versatility, stability, and 3D.  It includes many precision, dimension, and viewing options that allow you to make both simple and complex designs.  Using the split 2D/3D mode also helps with placing components such as windows and doors.  After I completed the drawings I showed them to my builder and he was able to remodel the rooms exactly as I had envisioned them.  Like most software I have used, this package does contains a learning curve.  I by no means consider myself a computer guru and I had to put in a little practice time.  You will find, however, a plethora of resources available both on-line and within the manual/tutorials to assist you with your project
This program is dependable and adequate within the limits that it is avertised to do. For instance, it won't keep track of inventory, since it was not designed to do so
It installed without any problems.  It runs without any problems. I am very happy with it. I am a convert from Microsoft Money.  I am self employed and have one employee.  My wife is also self-employed.  We have twenty different financial accounts (investment accounts, retirement accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts, a mortgage, a home equity line of credit and credit cards).  We often pay business expenses with our personal credit card, as the credit card gives us frequent flyer miles for every purchase.  Quicken 2007 Home and Business allows us to do our personal accounting and business accounting all in one program, which makes it much easier.  The one step update (automatic downloading of our transactions and balances from financial institutions) works with 17 of our 20 accounts.  Downloading data from the other 3 accounts requires some manual steps, but is still fairly painless.I like the online backup feature. It is inexpensive (you pay a small annual charge) and easy to use.I am not very impressed with the investment analysis features, although I have not yet fully explored them.  I would like to be able to compute realized and unrealized annualized rates of return for individual positions or groups of positions, and it doesn't seem like I can do that in this program.
There have been enough changes for the better to make this product well worth the purchase, installation,  learning curve
I use this program daily and it is awesome!  It has lots of great new features especially the new home page that has the customer, vendor and employee centers where you can now see all of the information in one place.  The features and functionality of the program are everything any small to mid size business needs to run their company from a financial point of view.  Great improvements over previous versions
I believe it is important to say that I am a QuickBooks ProAdvisor. As a technical consultant to small businesses, I began supporting QuickBooks several years ago after I saw how it benefited my clients.I began useing QuickBooks myself in 1999 for my business. This version is one of the best advances I have seen. The new home page shows the various work-flows in an easy to understand format, making it easy to get to the form I need with one click. I really like the new "Centers" for customers, vendors and employees. Most of the information I need when looking for history with a customer or vendor is available when I click on the customer or vendor name. With one more click I can easily see the original transaction. I used to have to go through several screens to get to the information I needed.The industry customization in the Premier Edition is a great addition and well worth the additional investment. I have a client using the Contractor Edition. The Contractor Center provides a quick glance at how the business is doing. The Job Cost reporting is an excellent tool to help better manage the business by comparing actual to estimated costs. They have been able to improve their estimates based on the information QuickBooks makes available to them.The key to having the information you need is to make sure you get it setup properly in the beginning. Spend some time reviewing the excellent on-line training and help before you setup your company files. If you don't like reading the instructions, another option would be to get the help of a local QuickBooks ProAdvisor for assistance.I highly recommend it.
I have been supporting QuickBooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years.  This year's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer's invoices, payments, estimates, - all in the same window - just by clicking on a customer in the list.  No more multiple clicks to create customer reports.  It is just plain easy, and the information pops up on your screen immediately. Congratulations to Intuit on a job well done
Building on the Intuitive QuickBooks Pro interface and SQL database, QuickBooks Premier enables firms to scale - merely by clicking on a button and paying the difference. This ensures no work is lost. There is a whole new menu dedicated to specific Industries. While the estimate can have multiple options, when the customer places an order, the Sales Order function enables QuickBooks to saddle up for the ride. It generates Purchase Orders with the click of a button, and when goods are received, keeps track of who it is for. Invoices are generated from the sales order as well, and partial invoicing keeps track so I don't leave money on the table. I use the email function all the time, sending pdf attachments and cc:g myself so there's a time stamp. To address the problem of sharing large files, there is a new Portable Company File (much like a Zip file) which compresses files for emailing. I have also grown to appreciate the online banking auto-reconciliation function - I log in to the bank every morning, and watch as transactions appear and then get matched with my books, leaving me only unreconciled transactions. QuickBooks also enables integration with third party software - there is a legion of industry specific solutions that help with core business operations. With 2006, QuickBooks has moved from being a software to a Business Operations System
The fact that they call this premier is a little overdone. The reality is that this is the "Pro" version with a few bells and whistles which in most cases do not warrant the additional price
I am a solo family medicine physician and have been using the Quickbooks Pro series since 2003.  At first, I was a little upset with being forced to upgrade my QB Pro 2003, however once I installed the new Premium 2006, I must say I am very pleased.From the beginning, everything has changed just a small bit, however in a very good way.  In my past version of QB Pro 2003, I had to toggle between different screens in order to move from deposits to writing checks, etc.  In Premium 2006 this is no longer the case.  A very easy to use and intuitive home page shows everything you need to use.  Each different tool is one simple click away.  I very much like the new enhanced payroll option in that I can now print out my state tax forms along with my federal forms.  In the past, it would take an hour or two out of my family time in order to fill in those little boxes and double check each figure with my CPA.  Now I print out each form and am finished in less than 10 minutes.I would highly recommend this product to any solo or small group practice.  The versatility and power found in Quickbooks Premium allows me to keep track of my finances personally.  The added convenience of the payroll services just makes this product an even better buy.  Yes, there are enough subtle differences between the Pro and Premium version to justify spending a few extra dollars.  I would definitely buy this software title again
Even though I don't belong to the art profession and have only very limited knowledge of the arts, I feel the contents are great and useful, based on my discussion with friends who are artists.I therefore bought it for my friends in the arts profession overseas
For years I used PowerQuest's Drive Image 7 for backups. It's rock solid and totally dependable. When Symantec aquired PowerQuest they rolled the underlying technology of Drive Image 7 into Norton Ghost. The result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups. Most importantly, like Drive Image 7, it provides for emergency recovery of your system. Just boot from the Ghost CD and restore the backup (restore point) that you select. I've tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups, and then restoring the system from those backups. The process works flawlessly. If you need to restore to a different physical drive (replaced a failed drive, etc), the process requires a few extra selections, but is still very straightforward. Just take the time to read the manual.I've seen Acronis True Image recommended by some both here and elsewhere. I've tried Acronis and find it lacking in one major respect: It simply is not reliable. During trials, I made backups with Acronis. Acronis indicated that the backups were successful but, when attempting to make a system recovery just minutes later, Acronis indicated that the backups were corrupted and could not be used. The backups were worthless.When purchasing backup software remember that bells and whistles don't count for anything. The only thing that counts is reliability. It must be able to reliably restore your system. Norton Ghost passes that test with flying colors.
Challenging and fun. Graphics a fair compared to the mindless flashy video games. Educational value is exellent, challenging and helps develop speed as well as accuracy. The challenge of having to think and get the right math answer in order to advance makes the games more challenging than the flashey graphic video games. If the animation was similar to the flashy video game adventures ( IE: Jak 3 or Ratchett and clank)it might make it too hard because of all the distractions and tools obtained. It might be interesting if that level of graphics and animation was worked into the game. The younger kids may be better able to intergrate a multi-tooled, multi-level, multi-directional with more mapping and varied spatial orientation than older people. My eight year old was able to gain more speed quicker on the game than I was
I have every single (that I know of) Math Blaster game out there. My kids love them all. I saw this one and couldn't resist buying it. My 12, 10, and 7 year-olds all play this version. (It's too simple for the 12 year old, but he plays as a reward for piano practice - so I'm not too concerned about his refreshing earlier math skills.) My thought it to have each child play the grade level above theirs, and that's ususally right where they're at. Yes, there are a few annoying glitches in the way some of the characters can and cannot move around (I don't play them myself to know well) but I would hope that children are not so whiny that it matters too much. I think every family should have Math Blaster Geometry, Algebra, and all grade levels. If you can make math fun, and use it as a POSITIVE REWARD...that is called a "win win"! :
I have tried other systems before and they took the "long way around" about getting to the Rock and Roll stuff I wanted. This one however jumps straight into what I wanted to know about ROCK guitar. The teaching method is fantastic. The program shows not only where notes would fall but includes a "virtual fret board" so I can see exactly what to play. This feature includes a "slow" version to start with then a normal speed version that (in almost every case) is exactly like the song being heard. I have played guitar (that is fooled with guitar) for about twenty years this program got me playing and learning every day for a couple hours. Now I have much more fun jamming and playing songs I have heard. I recommend this for anyone beginners to intermediate
I have been taking acustic guitar lessons for 6 years now. I decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar I recieved as a gift. It's a pretty good method. Sometimes a bit difficult to work with, but you do learn some things. I stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when I realized that I had a bass amp. So make sure you have all the right equipment, and I would have to say that this might be easier for someone who's taken guitar lessons.
I picked this up for my twelve year old son.  He is a beginner and has been glued to his electric guitar and eMedia Rock Guitar Method for the last two weeks.  The program is a great starter, just in case the kids don't stick with it.   It's better than $45 bucks an hour once a week, for now, at least.    Great Product!  I reccomend it
I thought this was a great product.  It's like having your own guitar instructor, but even better.  You only have to pay once and you get hours of instructions you can use for as long as you want.  Also, you can use it any time you want without having to make a trip.  I'm pleased with my purchase.  You will be too
Though I've odered many times with Amazon, this is the first time I have been excited enough to review a product!  I'm an adult who wants to learn guitar for fun and didn't want to play "Mary had a little lamb" and scales for months.  I have only used the software for about an hour, and have already been playing parts of songs I actually like!  I have been playing guitar for a total of one week prior to receiving this (without any instruction).This is perfect if you don't have the patience or desire to learn the traditional way.  I wish I had this when I was 14, I would have loved it.I can't vouch for the whole thing yet, since I've only played with it for an hour, so I give it 4 stars instead of five.  From what I've seen I have no reason to expect that it will let me down and highly recommend it
This is a good computer Bible, but for the money, I prefer a program like AMG Bible Essentials which has the Libronix Library System built-in and can be integrated with other Bible study software.  For about $15 more the AMG program has both KJV, Apocrypha and NASB, including a lot of other capability, like Greek translations, word study, exegesis, parallel Bible comparisons, etc.  The Rainbow Bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above.  Some benefits of this Bible include both NIV and KJV translations, color maps, Matthew Henry's commentary, Naves and a version of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. The various colors can be distracting at times, but overall it is worth considering, particularly if you like the NIV
I recently purchased this from a book club, and it is a wonderful Bible. Type is easy to read, and the imitation leather binding cover is of high quality. The various colors help guide you to passages of the same intent. Very innovative. Great.
I really love this Bible. Even for someone who is well-versed in Bible scripture, this adds a new dimension to your understanding. I purchased one for myself and liked it so much that I purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day.
I wanted this Bible for Mother's Day after I did not get it I ordered it on June 25 and got it rather quickly.  Enough said about the wonderful shipping time with Amazon Prime.I normally do not like Bibles that do not have the words of Christ in red but this Bible is sensational.  I love it!!!! I like the way it gives an overview of each book of the Bible.  The colorful maps and illustrations make this Bible beautiful.  At the end of the Bible there are 365 memory verses to be learned each day.  So not only is studying emphasized but learning scriptures is also emphasized.This Bible is wonderful for individuals who are new to reading the Bible.  I would highly recommend geting this Bible as a gift for a new convert or seasoned veteran in the Gospel who is interested in in depth study.  Reading this Bible is fun. 
ISBN-1581700296 Black Leather Non-Indexed KJVThis is a beautiful bible. Every verse is colored and each color stands for something such as Love, Family, Faith, Salvation, etc. It also has the center column reference, a one year bible reading schedule, a daily verse lisiting with, of course, 365 verses, one for each day of the year, various maps and pictures, outlines of each book, and a list of 100 popular bible verses, 50 from the old testament and 50 from the new. There is also a section in the front of the book that explains the color system and gives examples as well. It is also available in NIV as well as KJV. I'd highly suggest this bible to anyone, but shop around. The one I bought listed at amazon for $77.99 but I bought it at a local bookstore for $39.99 plus tax. Same book, same ISBN exactly. 
Simply superb programme and the standard by which other image manipulation software is judged allbeit with some disparagement. The advancements made from my first PS 3 through to PS 6 and now CS and CS2 has been truly remarkable. However think I will sit out CS 3 and catch up
Photoshop CS 2 Screen The Current Adobe Photoshop CS 2 Line    * The Adobe Bridge: The next generation of the Photoshop File Browser. This allows you to organize, browser and locate photos, images and movies across shared Adobe Creative Suite applications.      Since The Bridge is a standalone application, you can launch it separately or access it by double clicking on Adobe Photoshop CS 2 in the dock.    * New Camera Raw gives you control over your digital negatives in Adobe Photoshop CS 2. It is much easier to work on a several images at the same time. The Camera Raw has Auto checkbooks for Exposure, Shadows, Brightness and Contrast sliders.    * The Vanishing Point lets you clone, paint and transform images. Image Warping allows you to fold, stretch, pull, twist and wrap an image into shape by selecting an on-demand preset or dragging custom control points.    * Photoshop CS2's Smart Objects allow you to scale and transform images and vector illustrations without losing image quality, and    * Smart Guides appear when you're moving text or objects around, making it easier to align them.Working within the 'Inner Core' of Adobe Photoshop CS 2Most of my Photoshop CS work is done in the Browser. I single-click the photos that I need for my Photoshop CS project. Now I have a group of highlighted photos that can be used in the Browser's Automated menu.The inner core of the Photoshop CS Browser's Automated menu contains: Batch, PDF Presentation, Contact Sheet II and Online Services. Also, Automated menu contains Photomerge, Picture Package and Web Photo Gallery.Running these automated menu tasks from the File Browser saves me a lot of time. I can avoid opening each photo file separately in Photoshop CS.The Photoshop CS 2 Browser has Sort capabilities that contains the Filename, Flag, Rank, Width and Height. Also, Sort capabilities that contains File Size, Resolution, File Type and Color Profile.The Photoshop Browser's Sort contains Date Created, Date Modified, Copyright and Custom. You can sort them in ascending or descending order.Photoshop CS Photomerge and PDF PresentationsIn Photomerge, I can make a collage of photos and move them in any order. Also, I can take several sections photos of a large bridge using a tripod. I then take the section photos and join them together with Photoshop CS' Photomerge. I still have to edit the new Photomerge photo for length, size and contrast.In PDF Presentation, I can turn my photos into Acrobat PDFs and stitch them together. The fun is turning my new creation into a slideshow with various transitions. The PDF Presentation is cross-platform that can be used on a Mac and Windows computers.Working with the 'Outer Core' of Adobe Photoshop CS 2Keyboard CommandsThe one-key letter shortcuts that I use quite often is M for Marquee, V for Moving objects, T for Text, I for Eyedropper and C for Crop. There is a multitude of Toolbox one-key letter shortcuts that you can use or change.Toolbox uses the Shift bar to get to related tools on the same pop-out menu. For example, to cycle through the Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, and Magnetic Lasso tools, hold down Shift bar and keep pressing "L" key.Change Keyboard Commands in Photoshop CS 2This means that missing Photoshop CS Menu keyboard commands can now be added. For example, I am constantly making changes to my images by changing the photos' contrast and brightness.Now without using the computer mouse, I use the Command, Control, and C keys in unison. Like a piano chord, I can now change the contrast and brightness in my digital photographs.I use Command, Control, and letter keys for adding keyboard commands. This works well within the menus and plugin filters that I use in Photoshop CS.Pro ReactionPhotoshop CS offers flexibility and nondestructive editing. Photoshop's Welcome screen and improved Help ease the learning curve for new users. The Help menu is changeable. I find Photoshop CS' Help menu an excellent way to learn the various functions of Photoshop program. Photoshop CS comes with a paper, hardcopy paper manual. Photoshop CS 2 works best within Mac OS X 10.4 Macs including Intel Macs. Con ReactionYou have to read and work with hardcopy paper manual. The Bridge does not work in older Photoshop programs. Final WordsPhotoshop remains the industry standard for professional photo editing, graphic design, and digital imaging. Adobe Photoshop is considered the industry standard.

Photoshop CS 2 is in a league of it's own. It can be used to do professional photo retouching and correcting but it is also probably the best painting package out there. It's not perfect however. There are some features that high end compositing and color grading programs like Inferno and DaVinci have that Photoshop could use, and the warper is just bare bones but then we're talking big bucks and no doubt Photoshop will eventually have something like them. Except for a few filters, it can function in 16 bits per channel which was a long time coming but now it's here, making it a professional product. Still, as far as I'm concerned, the ultimate paint program has yet to be written
The response was very fast.  The item came as advertised.  It works on my MAC G4 very nicely
I was very pleased to discover all of the data packed into this program.  Setting up the query parameters is easy  the amount of info concerning places of interest (services, banks, transportation) is substantial.  About the only drawback I found was the quality of the help contents, which was not very user friendly.  Most of the time I was unable to find solutions to my question/problem because the data was way too complicated (displaying data in technical equations) or was not listed at all.  However, calls to technical support usually resolved the questions.  Finally, I was disappointed that the program does not allow you to print written legends off to the side on your map (ie: a listing of addresses for your push pin locations).  Other than that, the program is very handy, loaded with tons of great data  the quality of the maps is superior. 
I have used this product for about 5 years.  It is easy to use and alot cheaper than having your taxes done by someone else.  I especially would recommend it to any small business owner
Absolutely love this program. I'd been using Norton for years and so was initially hesitant to switch. Its not as user friendly as Norton and has the annoying habit of repeatedly asking for permission even after it has been granted. On the upside this feature adds to its efficiency and gives the user complete control over all internet activity, making it an exceptionally good security program.   
Good product Amazon had a great price.  Even though people say it is high priced I paid $44 after discounts.  I tried the Beta version and I liked it.  Beta version does not give you all of the features but enough to get the idea.  Easy to install worked at the get go.  Intuitive enough to figure it out.  You may have to go through things a few times to understand what it means.   Didn't have a manual with the Beta version and still figured it out. Manual does provide information, works great.  Didn't need any help. Had Mcafee before didn't find any new virus. It works as good as Mcafee but it is a lot faster when you start up.  Both Kaspersky and Mcafee have features I like. 
I've been using this for several years without ever having a problem. I like this new version even better than the last version by having everything in one control panel makes it easier than before. It uses less system resources than Norton plus I know people that have gotten viruses using Norton  McAfee. Kaspersky always rates in the top three. The only drawback is there is no anti spyware but I don't feel that is an issue. Let them worry about viruses  such  I'll continue using Webroot's Spysweeper to control spyware. Together, they make a great combo to keep my computer clean
I have used works type products for years.  Microsoft Works 7 is the best of the lot.  It will work on almost any computer in use today and is definitely a best buy at the current price
I have used MS WORKS from about the time it was born, when it was quite primitive and sometimes unstable. But I have continued to use it, primarily for databases, because it has become progressively more stable and easy to use.  These are not all small and simple databases--many include several thousand items, each with 20 to 30 fields of data.  It is easy to find single items or to assemble groups of items (filter), and to print customized reports.  So if you don't need (or want) the super sophistication of ACCESS, I have found WORKS to be a friendly and helpful--and inexpensive--alternative
I put MS Works on all systems that I make for other people. It has everything they need, and it dosen't break the bank. The only thing I don't like is that there is no Presentation software, or PowerPoint clone. Then again, if they included that, MS Office sales would go down A LOT!!
I've been working with Punch AS/4000 since v10.0 was released (about 12 months ago). Although I agree in many respects with the positive reviews. For example, there are is a large feature list. However, there are issues with the software. For example: - Hard coded limitations in the software design (e.g. four possible scale options for printing, does not support Grid Snap smaller than 3/8" or 10mm - which seriously complicates moving things around on a drawing with any degree of precision, very tiny dimension text on Windows, etc.)- Inaccuracies: I printed a 1:100 scale drawing that came out at 1:94 approximately;- I couldn't fit a scale house drawing on 8.5 X 11 paper, no print preview;- There are limitations and inconsistencies with dimensions (i.e. placement, snap to geometry, etc.)- The PowerTools seem to be a series of independently developed add on modules that don't necessarily conform with the application interface (e.g. precision, look and feel, functionality)- The elevation editor is very limited. It basically provides a visual representation of the drawing with some editing and texture applications- Can't differentiate exterior wall treatments independently from the wall surface (e.g. brick and siding on the same floor).- Object library is very limited for plumbing fixtures, furniture, windows, etc. Common items aren't in the library nor are they easy to find. (You can create them yourself though).- The 3D object editor is ok but not terribly intuitive.- Multi-floor buildings get complicated to work with once you add floors or ceilings.- Once you add objects, drawings get big and slow very quickly.- Import/Export is limitedIn short AS/4000 could use an overhaul, an updated object library, a major upgrade to scale and printing and an overall clean-up to create a more integrated and functional product. Also, incorporate user feedback into future releases
This is really good software.  I own CAD software, but it doesn't do what Punch Home Design can do.  It has a bit of a learning curve, but if you take the "step by step" tutorials, you'll find it much easier to learn.  I did a module of the tutorial (there are several), then I saved that drawing as "test" and loaded my own and did the appropriate things to it.  By going back and forth, I got to use the steps being taught several times which made it easier to remember "how" to do that thing.  If you're planning to remodel (that's what I'm doing) or building from scratch, this software will give you a real good idea of what your completed remodel or construction will be like.  It will more than pay for itself by saving you from making a costly mistake
After using this software for a week, I'm generally pleased with the results. The learning curve is not too difficult to climb; though I have some prior experience with less sophisticated versions of this type of software.The box comes with a thick printed manual, which is nice to have for reference. The index in the manual is good but not great. Unfortunately the manual is not comprehensive. It appears to cover the core functionality but does not have any depth to its discussion of "power tools". The manual appears to be a nearly verbatim copy of the online help.The software comes with short online instructional videos -- basically animated screen captures with voice-over commentary. The two or three videos that I've watched have filled in the gaps that the manual left open.My pc has a 2001-era 1Ghz Celeron and 1GB of memory. It renders the 3D drawings fast enough to not be frustrating, and I have limited patience for this sort of thing. However, I have not added great amounts of detail to the plan yet -- mostly just walls, roof, electrical, and some trim. The addition of detail may slow rendering down enough to be annoying. Other reviewers have complained about performance, but the documentation has hints for speeding up if you run into problems.While the core parts of the software are pretty good, the power tools leave a little something to be desired. This may just be a lack of education on my part, but if so then I'm going to blame the skimpy documentation. These power tools almost appear to have been developed by either different groups or by third parties. Overall they lack the polish and usability that is part of the core software. Take the "room wizard", for example. This is a slick way to put together the interior floor plan of the house. The problem is that the room wizard launches almost as a separate application, and when you're done it asks to "update the current design". When you say yes, it appears to paste the picture drawn in the room wizard back into the main application. From there, it is difficult (impossible?) to get the interior layout to overlay your foundation design.I had difficulty with other power tools: the topo designer is clunky, the site planner has an annoying lot size limitation (no line can be more than 1000'), the estimator won't let you add additional materials (you can put in the cost of concrete for your foundation, but you can't add fill or stone for drainage; if I have to manually put this stuff into a separate spreadsheet then having a built-in estimator is pointless). And so on. Again, maybe this is a learning thing, but the rest of the software is easy to figure out -- why are these so different?Overall, I would give the software 3.5 stars: four stars for doing the stuff it absolutely must do very well, minus one star for advertising extras that don't work so good, plus a star for good documentation on the core functionality, minus half a star for failing to document the extras. (I figure that the extra thirty to fifty bucks of cost over competing brands is due to these extras, but I haven't tried the competition.
If you are even remotely familiar with home design or CAD software then this is your product assuming you can't deal with the price or steep learning curve of Chief Architect Base v10 (~$1300).  Chief Architect (CA) is the Holy Grail of powerful yet intuitive home design software but it's not cheap and it's not for beginners; it is really aimed at pro's not home enthusiasts.  Most home enthusiasts would be far better off with Punch! AS4000.  But if you have a brain, some patience, and like a challenge and want the best, go with CA.Punch! AS4000 v10 is the *best* product on the market in the sub-$1000 price point *easily* beating out products like CadSoft Envisioneer @ $795 (4x the cost!).  In my opinion CadSoft Envisioneer has no market.  If you are going to spend $800 on "Pro" software, get Chief Architect for $500 more.  If you don't need that much power that CA has (ie you aren't an engineer or architect drawing formal construction blueprints), than buy Punch! AS4000 for $500 less than Envisioneer.  Envisioneer is a product priced in no-mans land.  It's a suckers buy.Back to the product at hand.  First, Punch! AS4000 isn't as easy to pick up for a neophyte (ie complete computer design newbie) as say 3D Home Architect or Better Homes  Gardens (both of which were spawned from the same 3DHA v4 code base).  But, it is much more fully featured, faster and much more powerful and less buggy.  It's UI is more standard and intuitive to Windows software guru's, and it's 3D renderer blows away the competition not only in speed but quality.  It renders stunning 3D scenes which blow away the competition visually at 1/4 to 1/3 the time!Plus, Punch! recently (and quietly) acquired 3DHA from Riverdeep / Encore to supplement thier "bottom-end sub-$40 market".  In other words, Punch! considers 3DHA to be the bottom-feeder and not real competition against thier product for which they are 100% correct.  3DHA and it's derivatives are junk compared to Punch!; every few years I review them all and Punch! has been on top for a while.  Not just in features.  Not just in speed.  Not just in reliability / stability.  But across the board.  TopTenReviews recently gave Punch! the #1 spot, as they deserve.  Punch! has also been the top selling home enthusiast design software for the last 6 years running.  It's not by accident.  It's because it is the best; hands down.3DHA users should seriously consider jumping ship to Punch! now that they own it.  The only reason to consider 3DHA over Punch! is if you are a total clueless newbie.  Once you are no longer a totally clueless newbie, it's time to move to a serious program like Punch!  Even if you have a lot of 3DHA content, it doesn't mean you shouldn't start moving over to Punch!  You can continue to use both until Punch! has a solid 3DHA importer.This recent acquisition means that Punch! owns 75%+ of the home design software market for home enthusiasts.  This is estimated to be a $50 million market and Punch! pretty much has it owned.  Since Punch! considers 3DHA to be the bottom-feeder, don't count on the 3DHA title or code base to be drastically improved in the future.  In fact, if I had to gues I would bet that over time the existing 3DHA code base will be scrapped by Punch! and replaced with it's own code base w/ some of the power tools stripped.In short:1) if you are a professional who knows their way around CAD and want the best for home design despite the cost, get Chief Architect v10 Base ($1300) or Full ($2k+).  It's learning curve is steep but nothing beats it.2) if you are a home enthusiast who has a clue around CAD or home design software, then this (Punch! AS 4000) is your choice.  End of story.  Buy it.3) if you are a complete newbie and have never used home design or CAD software before, I recommend buying the cheapest v6 or v7 3DHA Special Edition you can find here on Amazon for only $9.99!!!  It's very limited but will serve it's purpose.  Go through the tutorials.  Learn how to use it.  Play with it until you know what is going on.  Design something simple.   This way it costs you only $10 to leverage all of the tuts included in 3DHA and come up to speed with the terminology and concept of home design.  Then toss it and buy Punch! AS 4000 v10 to do your real work. It takes a real program to do real work. ;-P- Rhino
I bought this product because I had tried with great success another Punch product. It was so easy to use and load onto my computer. It was a great value to be able to have one product that allows me to redesign anything from interior floors and walls, to my deck and plants outside
It is the coolest game about horses. It teaches the most important basic about caring for horses and riding horses. It is a bit confusing at the beginning and a little help from Mom or Dad should be welcome, even though my daughter found things that I did not, it's a team effort at the beginning. After that it's just very pleasurable, and can go on for ever. According to my daughter it is very addictive (!!) and she has already Dreamer and Lets ride. OK it's not high visual 3D as the others, but let's face it, a lot more entertaining.In all it is a real cool game, and worth the 5 stars. Perfect gift, and good for Mom and Dad also...
Daughter plays it all the time.  Pretty Quick shipping.  Brand new.  Excellent seller
My 11 year old daughter loves playing this game. Graphics could be better but overall it teaches them a lot about horses and how to take care of them. Great for any horse lover in your family
My 12 year old daughter plays this game for hours at a time.  She is a horse nut and loves it.  The player gets to groom, breed and train horses.  I would definetly recommend for any horse crazy kid
I bought this and I think it is a very good game but, I can not really continue the game because I lose money trying to get some by doing the 5 things. I am going to keep on trying to finish the game. If you are really good at solving games and love horse I would get this game. And anyone can try it and if you keep on trying it you can win the game
At first I didnt like this game because of the graphics but once I learned how to play I really thought it was fun one time I was so interested that I woke up at 8:00am and played the whole game to 11:00pmIf you are a horse lover and know some amount about horses you will love this game if you do NOT like horses you might still like it but I dont know because I am a major horse lover so here are some things in the game--feed and groom your horse every day.-keep practicing your riding skills you could make it to the championships-they will giveyou tasks to do for instance "breed a horse".- you can go to the breeders office to breed a horse or you can own a stallion and a mare and buy the breeding pasture and breed them yourselves          If you buy this item I hope you have fun with it and hope my review was helpful to you.                    -Libb

Every once in a while you come across a product that does just what you wanted it to.  The Snapstream remote is one of them.I just recently built a home theater pc through which I play music and movies. However, the HTPC is in a different room than my projector and I needed a way to operate the pc remotely while in the theater room.  I chose the Snapstream remote for this function and have been well pleased.I also highly recommend the Snapstream remote for those people using or looking to use the Beyond TV PVR solution.  I record all my favorite TV programs on my HTPC in high-def and able to access them with a single click of a button via the Snapstream remote.This is one product that I can recommend with no reservations
This remote works really well and it's easy to create your own profiles for whatever application you use, or to customize it however you want.  There is a good user community that is doing a lot of cool things with the Firefly.  Set up is simple and the range is good.  It "just works."  The only suggestion is that the buttons are not backlit so it's hard to use in the dark.  Adding to that problem is that the remote is pretty much symmetrical so you can be holding it upside down and not really realize it.  If it weren't for that I'd give it five stars, and if they came out with a version that had backlit buttons I wouldn't hesitate to upgrade
I am very pleased with the way this remote performs. I have my computer conected to my TV, and with this remote, I am able to control my computer from the living room, to watch TV, watch DVDs that I have on my hard drives, and listen to music. Beyond media, works great with the remote, and is very user friendly
I've used the ATI all-in-wonder remote with a make-shift media center solution before and it's been sluggish, and sometimes non-responsive.  Not so for the FireFly.  Quick, responsive and adaptive. I also tried the CyberLink media remote.  Not even suitable to prop-up a bird-food tray.  You'll find Cyberlink's tech support is positively absurd.  Their primary focus is to ask you tons of questions till you run out of patience, or till they find an excuse to tell you they can't help you.The firefly really rocks.  Controls several programs and tools and even provides a mouse interface incase you can't get things just right with the application and pre-defined buttons.  If you have a PC and want media-center performance on it - I'd recommend this guy.Sadly the data is RF for this remote; not IR.  I was hoping to 'absorb' all the functions of this remote into my Harmony 688 but they don't talk the same.  I think SnapStream offers another product to talk IR for the same purposes, but I'm not there yet.  Still getting my sea-legs with the Firefly's abilities. 
I've had this PC remove for 1 year and I have used it everyday that I am home and I have not yet changed the remote batteries.  My PC has suddenly become more entertaining and useful.  With this remote, the time I spend sitting in front of the monitor is reduced.In my 860 sq ft APT, the farthest point away from my pc is about 50 ft.  The remote has always worked from anywhere in the APT thru 2 walls. I was surprised to get this much range. I have not yet found a spot from which it doesn't work.  To get the best range BE SURE to position the USB RF receiver near the computer as directed.With my PC, I'm always playing music.  I also play digital video files that were either taken with my camera or were rented digitally from the Internet.  I have a good graphics card with S-Video TV out.  I got a 50 ft S-Video/Out cable; this connects my PC and TV which are in different rooms.  With this remote, I now can play (and control) my entire digital music collection on my home stereo (which is connected to the TV) without being at my PC or be in the same room as my PC.  Also, with this remote, any video that can be played on my PC, (online streaming or local) I can watch and control it (pause, rewind, slow motion, next, FWD) on my TV.  My PC/TV has effectively become a powerful media center--Media center PC not needed.   There is so much more...  with the remote, I use the mouse from far away (lying in bed or on the couch); there a numerous ways to get creative with this.I wish the remote was lighted. Still, the keys are arranged for "touch typing" so to speak.  Another negative, I've noticed that Windows Media Player sometimes crashes when video is launched from within the software that comes with the remote.
I purchased this Firefly remote a month ago to work with my PC-PVR (I have got a Hauppauge PVR-250 card and BeyondTV 3).  As my computer and TV set are in different rooms, I thought it would be convenient to have an RF remote control so that I can still control video recording/playback while sitting in front of my TV. RF signals can usually travel a longer distance, and most importantly, they can penetrate walls.However, my first installation with the Firefly remote was not a totally success.  It functioned well, but I have only measured a 6-foot of workable distance - with full battery power, and no blocking objects or interference sources nearby.  I thought either I had a defective item, or the product was not as good as they said.I contacted Snapstream for support, and they suggested to try a different USB port or use a powered USB hub for plugging receiver.  My computer has 6 USB ports - 4 in back and 2 in front, all built on the motherboard.  I was using a front USB for the measurement.  After I switched to an USB port in back, everything becomes perfect.  I have learned that even all being built on the same motherboard, USB ports can be different, which may provide different power levels for external devices.Now my Firefly works great for my application, which is about 13 feet of transmission distance and with a wall (and some blocking objects as well) inbetween.  Firefly remote can even perform the job of a mouse.  Although it may not be as fast and convenient as a real mouse, it comes in handy for quick-and-easy controls. For the convenience the Firefly remote brings, I give it 5 stars!
have been using acrobat since v3,v4,v6.  v8 is in line. seems a bit faster, smoother etc.  have tried imitations on other machines.  from a purely subjective view, acrobat is best.  a bit pricey, but the best. with the usual caveats, can be installed on a desktop and a notebook, but requires a call to tech support which was quick and smooth
This is a major upgrade from previous versions . . . much easier to use and a much cleaner format
I bought this package because I wanted good, high-compression universally accessible documents and images for my personal web page. (Google Werbos).Finally, after zillions of googles on compression technology and trying many other things (see my other reviews), I found something that really, really works well, in a highly flexible and controllable way! What a relief! Much better than Acrobat 6.0, and other packages I have tried and reviewed.     The key capability lies in the "save as" command, which includes "optimized pdf" as one of the file types. The "settings" there gives you the power to choose JBIG2 and JPEG2000 compression, the very best formats for black and white or color scanned images or papers. And of course, as pdf, they are easy for anyone to read.    An example: two weeks ago, the world's top empirical nuclear physicist, in Japan, sent me a set of 24 1-meg JPEGs for a 24-page paper. Nothing I had would read it, except Microsoft Digital Image, which let me fix the pages and crop them; in Adobe 6.0, they ended up being a readable 14 meg document. No better. I printed it out at work, and scanned in the result at 400 dpi to a good modern copier/scanner. It ended up 5 megabytes. (The copier was modern and "intelligent".) Then, at home, in Adobe 6, it wouldoptimize it to pdf version 6, a nice 2.6 megabyte file. Today, I got itto 940 K (and better quality, to the eye)in Acrobat 8.0, in a controllablepredictable way. I had previously tried many, many other options (including lots of Microsoft programs, all options).    If I understand what I have seen... I could have used Acrobat 8.0 DIRECTLY, without all that printout and scan nonsense! The direct control in the "save as" command gets rid of the need to do all that. What's more,I just reduced a 3.5 meg file (from the best previous material) to 1.02 megs. (As best I recall, I used CVISION before and only got that file to 1.5-2 megs. Acrobat 8.0 seems to be doing much better.)    If you google a lot on compression and comparisons, you will see some small advantage of CVISION over older versions of Adobe Image Capture and Acrobat. But that's misleading. In Acrobat 6.0, I couldn't GET to that better compression. (Maybe if I had a PhD in Adobe, I could, but I tried hard..). With 8.0, it was easy. And the results are better than CVISION now, so far as I can tell. I certainly see no value at all in the new XPS formats Microsoft is touting, with Vista, now that something so much better is available.    One caveat: published benchmarks say that the DjVu format may be better yet. I did not consider it, partly because of cost, but more because everyone knows how to get the latest pdf reader but DjVu might stop people going to my web page. But if Google Books popularizes it, I might reconsider DjVu. But then again... knowing what lies behind DjVu.. we might figure out something even better... eventually...  and maybe the future pdf standards will open to that!
I have used Tax Cut for several years.  Have had no complaints.  It is easy to use and is very complete.  Plan to use it again next year
It was easy to use.  Plus I could import my old tax info from last year, my bank info and my deductions.  I electronically filed my taxes and had my refund within two weeks.  I buy this product every year and was pleased that Deduction Pro was included
Installed on Windows XP with no problem and have already done an e-file before the "mid-Feburary" update mentioned by others.  No problems with either.  Having used TurboTax for 6+ years, I had been led to believe that TaxCut was inferior to TurboTax.  I was pleased to discover that TaxCut is just as good as TurboTax and it's cheaper too!  It also includes a rebate for a free Federal e-file, something that Intuit quietly has removed from this year's TurboTax.  I plan to use TaxCut from now on
I think the rosetta stone software is a pretty effective mode of learning. However, it is necessary to do it on a regular basis and would probably be even more effective if one were to study verbs and vocabulary outside of the program. In order to get the most out of the program I feel it is essential to do all the portions of each level/lesson.
So I did the unthinkable. I put Windows Vista Business on my Mac--specifically my Mac Mini. it works great, no system slow downs and no crashes. The Mac handles Vista beautifully. I had no problems using Boot Camp 1.2 in order to install it. The Mac Drivers for Vista (included with Boot Camp) all worked fine. The Vista installation took all of about 30 minutes including some updates and such. I had Windows XP home on my mac b4 and while it worked well , Vista Business works much more smoothly.  As you may or may not know a Mac Mini is not exactly a powerhouse computer. I have a 1.66 gigahertz Core Duo with 1gb of Ram on it. It displays the Aero interface perfectly especially hooked up to my 32 inch Widescreen LCD TV. Seems even the lowest cost Mac can still make Vista shine while most PCs cant. One disclaimer tho. All intel macs can run Vista Ultimate without a hitch except the Mac Mini (which can only go up to Business/Home Premium)While Vista is still behind OS X 10.4 (Tiger) its a much better release from XP. Now im just waiting to upgrade my little Mac Mini in October for the release of OS X 10.5 (Leopard)
I can never understand why others would want to use anything else, I have tried four others and this one has been the best of all. I now have been using this product starting about 1989, I upgrade about every 3 to four year
The software is better than the previous Family Tree Deluxe version I bought.  It allows you to better classify potential matches and decide whether to look at them later or tag them if not interested. The merging process of two databases is easier and allows you to pick what info to merge or whether to keep some info as secondary
I fell in love with another genealogy software years ago and was not happy with any newer ones when support and updates stopped for my original version.  When Ancestry updated this year I decided I had to try a new software package again that was compatible with the cool things you can now do on Ancestry so purchased this version.  I was very pleasantly surprised and happy.  I am still learning the best way to do things and occsionally get frustrated correcting info I have entered incorrectly but I would certainly recommend it.  The online checking it does and ability to attach the records found online is pretty awesome
After many years of the same look and marginal upgrades, Family Tree Maker finally made a serious change to the look and feel of the product. There are still some awkward navigation issues, but overall, I think this is worth a look if you are a long term user and haven't upgraded in a while or are just starting out. Having used the available online services that this company offers, I was pleased to find a new feature that integrates some of the online search functionality. Although the integration is a bit superficial, it is useful and made some of my online searches of their databases more productive. I think this is a big step in the right direction and hope they continue to add to the power of this feature as it makes the treasure trove of data they have more accessible.Too bad they do not make a Mac version, as I prefer this to the Mac products available and so I have to use it with Parallels, which is not so convenient
Though it may lack some of the integrated tools of Quicken or other financial software, MS Money continues to be the best entry level software of its genre and the best value for the money.  Particularly notable is the ease of integrating it with your on-line banking tools to create a one stop shop for your financial needs
I upgraded to this version from Money 2000.  The interface looks cleaner, and the reports and budgeting options are better.  I do find it a little less intuitive than the older version that I am used to.  Overall, I'm happy with this product and there is room for me to get to know it better.  I think it will last me for several years
Money has built in value for the none accoundant person. With little or no training a novice can become familar with this software in a very short time. Microsoft has a winner
I bought this a few months back and have used it quite a bit. The maps look good although i havn't noticed much change from version 2005. There are still some mistakes in the maps and they are still behind on being updated. A little slow to load on both computers but it does fine after it gets going. It has alot of nice features that make it convenient to use. The phonebook is very nice!
I am not a professional reviewer or a tech guru, but based on my experience with this product I am very satisfied.  I love the new interface and how easy it is to work with documents and apply formatting with such ease.  I have only used it for a month now and I still have to use some of the applications yet.  If you have the money and will love to have a new Office Suite that can give you some happiness working with documents every day, go for it
This anti-virus (and everything else) software was highly recommended by my company's network tech.  For stand-alone computer home use, it is significantly better than any others (especially Norton) because it is not a memory hog, so doesn't slow your machine down.
A VERY effective Internet Security package ... we installed this on my girlfriend's PC a few months ago and it's done a super job in keeping her machine trouble free.  Two thumbs up.  Effective, easy to install and use and keep updated.  A real winner.
I am so satisfied with this TrendMicro Security system, that I highly recommend it to everyone.  Without mentioning my previous system, this is TOPS!  I have never felt so secure before getting this System.Thank you for being able to supply me with it.  I hope through word of mouth and mail, that I have caused others to go for it.  I do know of 3 people at least who are changing.Thank you again
This edition of the color calibration hardware and software is very professional - a fact that is reflected in the price tag. However, the difference between the uncalibrated and calibrated states on a television is very noticeable.The kit includes the colorimeter (color measurement device) with a USB connection. The assumption here is that a laptop or nearby desktop is available to calibrate the televisions. The software makes calibration extremely easy. It allows the user to select which color and picture controls the TV allows them to use (not all televisions present the same controls, and even then, they often have different names) and modifies its process accordingly. Calibration takes approximately 30-45 minutes, but the results are undeniably an improvement.The kit comes in a sturdy plastic case with foam cutouts for the hardware and software (much like a Stargate SG-1 case for an alien device :-) ). While expensive, the software and hardware can be used on nearly anything that displays a picture - TVs of any kind and computer monitors - without limit.The one caveat is that, for LCD and other TVs or monitors with "delicate" screens, the suction cup provided to stick the colorimeter to the device requires a good deal of force. In fact, the force required is more than I am comfortable with applying to any display I have, except CRTs. As such, calibration requires one to either hold the colorimeter to the TV for each measurement (not really a problem), or buy the tripod for the device. This is the only downside.This device is definitely of professional quality and is a must for any home theater enthusiast or the perfectionist in your household. It might even be possible to recover the cost of the unit by becoming a calibration technician... :-
I really like OmniForm 5.  Actually I'm using version 5.1 and I'm very satisfied with it.I was using another forms program I had purchased that was adequate but not nearly as good.  After using FormTool I have a much greater appreciation of OmniForm.ScanSoft has been on my list of not to buy software recently  because of some of the poor performance of some of their other programs, tech support is expensive from ScanSoft and none of their software that I have used have been easy to learn using the manuals or help files.  In contrast OmniForm was well worth the money.OmniForm 5 does a great job of either creating forms from scratch, scanning or converting from PDF.  It's the only forms program I have tried so far that actually does a great job of importing a form from a PDF file.Its has all the tools you need to create a form starting with a blank page.  You can define any field with a variety of formats. Example you can create a date field with a specific format then no matter how the data is input the program will automatically reformat the data the way you specified.  You can create just about any field simply by dragging a symbol from a menu onto the page. In the case of inserting a graphic you can choose to have the graphic saved with the form or not saving with the form itself to conserve file size. You can have the graphic resized by the program with little loss of quality.  Features such as these might be available in other programs of this type but I found OmniForm to do the best job with creating a form field by field with the least effort.Scanning in of a form is almost flawless.  It even recognized fields on the paper form that were meant to be circled and created the field for them.  Other programs I have used could not do this well if at all.  The only adjustments I had to make on scanned forms were sometimes OmniForm recognized text as bold when it wasn't and occasionally it would change the font. For example it would change Arial to Times New Roman on some spots of the form. Strange quirk.To get a form imported from a PDF file you have to open the PDF file and print to OmniForm.  This is very accurate with little adjustment necessary after import. OmniForm really shines in this area.  But I did notice if the form your importing from PDF has multiple pages OmniForm will give you an out of memory error when you try to save.  To overcome this flaw you have to import one page at a time, creating a new page each time in OmniForm to make a multi page form from PDF. A little time consuming when you have a 9 page form. It will create a self running .exe form you can e-mail and the person on the other end can fill out the form and send it back. This works even the other person does not have OmniForm on their machine.  Because some people filter out .exe file attachments the program also creates a .html version of the form.  This is a very handy feature.The help file is not of much use. The paper manual is better but still lacking. If you have problems tech support from ScanSoft is expensive.  But there is a user support forum you can get to through the support page on the ScanSoft web site. I have used the forum with great success.Overall this program is a little difficult to use with some quirks and needed features like being able to import and save a multiple page form from PDF.  But well worth the effort to use as it is the most accurate forms program I have used.I do recommend this program.  If the flaws I mentioned were corrected I would give this program 5 stars
As a Beta user I assure you that this will make your life easier by not having to stock a lot of forms from the court
Excellent product.  The 'over $450 value' might be a bit overstated but the packages is still an excellent value.  During installation, the 1 year free trial to [...] showed up as a 30 day trial but was resolved quickly through familytreemaker.com support and a subsequent call to ancestry.com support.  Ancestry.com provided a 1 year free trial to their US Deluxe product over the phone and didn't ask for a credit card number for renewal.  To me, that's a sign that they're a reputable company.  Some of the additional software in the package is buried on the installation CD but is worth the extra manual effort to find and install - especially the GenSmart software. 
I have used a few other genealogy products and this is the best so far. I am a novice and for me Family Tree is easy to use and has a lot more features than Roots Magic. The initial cost was more but the extras included made it a better value
I have not had a chance to thoroughly review this product, but I was disappointed the calendar feature could not display the information I wanted especially since I had contacted customer service prior to purchasing the program and was assured it could be done
I have been using the Family Tree Maker products for a number of years.  I love its ease in the ability to add new people into the genealogy charts.  I am a little disappointed in the change that moved the screen away from looking like a tabbed folder.  I feel that the old style was a lot more user friendly, both visually and functionally
This SW is fantastic.  Having the on-line access made this product perfect, without ionline access this product would only be a storage device for family history that you already know.  I was able to get info on my family back to the 1800's in a matter of days since other relatives did all the research (relatives I don't even know).
I am new at researching my family history.  the v16 collector's ed of Family Tree Maker was just what I needed.  as an extra bonus it has a 1 yr. subscription to [...] to enhance the research capabilities.  I would definitely recommenend this program
THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM IF YOU NEVER OWNED AN OLDER VERSION OF FAMILY TREEMAKER.  THE NEW VERSION IS SO SIMILAR TO THE OLDER VERSIONS IT DOESN'T PAY TO UPGRADE
If you're reading this. You want to upgrade, your old computer to Windows XP Professional Edition here are a few things to keep in mind. First thing is, you can download service pack two from Windows update. So no need to buy it integrated with XP. These are what I consider the minimum system requirements: 256 MB of RAM. I have found is adequate more equals better. 500 MHz or higher will do. 7200 rpm hard drive will help a lot. If you're running Windows millennium edition, or 98 upgrade now the stability is vastly improved. Gone are the blue screens of death. Frequently asked question: is Windows XP Pro better than home edition? Windows XP Pro has a more high-end networking features that most home users will never miss or would even know were missing. So for most users Windows home edition is fine. They both are based on the same code and are almost identical. If you're thinking of upgrading from Windows 2000, I did, because I like the GUI interface better. But Windows XP is as stable as Windows 2000. So it's your call. The plug-and-play ability of Windows XP is totally great! Windows XP will by default find most drivers for video card sound cards, network cards, etc. that is such a bonus gone in the days of having to search for CDs with drivers. I recommend upgrading to Windows XP be a professional or home edition. It is a great operating system Have some fun and get it done
The product of Windows XP- Professional is just what I was looking for with many updated features and I am looking forward in using it daily.  It was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it.  But most of all, Service was "top knotch".  I could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems I may have had. Customer service is a plus. I would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller
First off, for people who are complaining  about installing Windows 2000, it only took my approx. 6 1/2 hours! I love it because every time I launch Internet Explorer it freezes! I also love that theres 42 spyware programs and 78 tojans on my harddrive before I even hooked up my internet. The one thing I love the most though is that I can download any movie I want. Like the recently video game adapted film Mortal Kombat! It was at full quality on my 28.8k modem and it took about 3 minutes. The blue sceen of death happens so often i just went ahead and set it as my desktop and my screensaver. I also bought the separate Ctrl Alt Del accesory pad, ive had it for about 2 days and i cant even tell what key is what anymore because i've used it so much. But all in all DOS has been a blessing, and i hope everyone embraces Windows 95 into their homes.- Shanan
I think that this is a very good Operating System, but it is FAR TOO OVERPRICED!A Note to the person who has the issue with disk#4 of his setup disk set:Try and get access to another computer and run diskcopy, if that does't work, then boot into MS-DOS with a Windows 98SE bootdisk and select the CD-ROM Drive letter and then type "CD I386" then type "winnt" then it will start the installation from the Compact Disc.I gave it 4 stars because i believe that they could sell a better Operating System for that price
I have been using computers since DOS 5.0 and this is by far the most user friendly, comprehensive, and powerful operating system I have used so far.  Aside from Linux, if you are interested in an easy to use, dynamic OS go with XP professional.  It has lots of features that are always coming in handy.  Unless you wanna go crazy and are an IT Power User (in which case Linux), go with this OS.  Its great
I found this upgrade has fixed some things and attempted to fix things that did not require fixing.  Hot keys that go to dockers does not speed up the work process.  It appears to be slower in handling bmps.  Larger files cause it to hesitate selecting objects.  A real memory hog.  The new contour tool makes the upgrade worthy.  So far it is not crashing like 12 did
I have used Corel Draw for many years, and too many had serious problems. This version seems to make up for the past with a stable system capable of most anything artistic. It is still a complicated system, though
CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number.i stayed with Corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches, bugs and the dreaded "odd-numbered" curse (if you tried version 5 or 7, you feel my pain). Adobe Photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... CorelPhotoPAINT just never quite "did it" for me.Industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into Adobe Illustrator. Being already familiar with Adobe Photoshop's features, tools and "look and feel", Illustrator didn't present a huge, overbearing learning curve. In Illustrator, i found the same robust features as CorelDraw ... which wasn't what impressed me about Illustrator. Adobe's intuitive programs, and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... THAT is what won me over to Illustrator. Illustrator's ability to edit/create PDF's in their native format? WOW! Exporting LAYERED vector files to Photoshop ... with layers INTACT??? WOW!!! (i could go on)Now, that being said ... there are STILL things that i prefer in CorelDRAW compared to Illustrator. The EXTRUDE function in corel is MUCH easier to utilize. The PowerClip function is more user friendly than Illustrator's "make clipping mask" function. The ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature. (again ... i could go on)In regards to importing and exporting files from other applications, CorelDRAW wins, hands down. It boasts a ROBUST set of import and export filters, my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves DURING the import. This is a MUST HAVE if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack. If i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into Illustrator with fonts blown out ... i'd be independently wealthy. WHY Illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me.So, to sum it up ... CorelDRAW is a great program ... but i can't imagine it being my ONLY vector drawing program. Just like in real life, you need a great team. This program, paired with Adobe Creative Suite, meets my needs perfectly.
 very good it does what I want and more. Now to get more training on doing more with this produc
This new version is cleaner and better than V12 in several areas that are important to me.  Particularily the improved trace features
CorelDraw X3 is a fine product.  It has added some nice features from V-11.  CorelDraw came with a rebate and I must say Amazon failed big time in helping me apply for it...on line was a joke replied by e-mail 3 time never got a reponse...talked to reps 2 times they did not help....yes I got the product in 5 days....but if you have a small problem....Amazon aint gunna get R done
I have been a user since version 4. Version 4 was bad, 5 was good, 6 was terrible, 7 was great, tried 8  didn't see the point, 9 was stable and very good. I avoided 10. 11 is very good. In Version 12 Corel had added features that made me want to go back to 11. So now here we are on X3.  Let me tell you, It has been 5 years since could say I love this program! It loads faster than 11 or 12 (and about a bizillion times faster than Adobe's Illustrator). It seems in this version, Corel has really given it's users a good listen because the additions to this program bring draw up to a new level of "I can harldy wait to work on a new project". Many of the improvments are simply little things in the way of navigation and shortcuts. Some, like the improved trace work wonderfully and seamlessly. You can go to corel's website to learn of the other improvments. I think you'll be pleased.  This is a designer's tool that you can purchase and use with confidence.
He trabajado por 14 anos con CorelDraw....desde casi sus inicios...para verlo convertirse en un programa realmente poderoso...sin competencia en su area a mi parecer. en esta nueva version de Corel...el X3...les digo que no me ha desilucionado....no hay muchas herramientas nuevas....pero son excelentes, lo bueno es que se estan dedicando a mejorar las herramientas anteriores...lo que es mucho mejor todavia
I've been using System Mechanic 6 Professional, for about a month. I'd have to say that the overall performance of Windows XP has improved greatly since installation. Upon starting System Mechanic, a general report is given on the overall health of Windows. It fixes problems in the registry, defragments the hard-drives/ram, and boosts internet performance. All of this is done is done in a short period of time (under an hour).I've also read all the negative reviews on Amazon. I'm not going to dispute any of them, since each user has his/her own experiences using the product. All I can say, is that I'm glad that the software worked for me. 
You likely won't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very "messy" system. But it does have a great antivirus and firewall, and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on "behind the scenes", it's an okay product. But be very careful with the cleanup tool. It will delete some important files if you are not careful!!
I have had my computer for a couple of years now, and I have always wondered if there was ever a product out there to help me rid my computer of WASTE. Well this product was recommended to me by a family member, and I am impressed as to how well it does!! I have never had so much success with one ALL-IN-ONE product as I have the System Mechanic 6 Professional, and the fact that it came with Virus Protection was and added bonus for me too. If your computer is slower than slow I definately recommend that you use this product to get rid of the Unnecessary Junk on your system, and keep up to date with the latest Viruses out there. I don't think I will ever go back to MCCAFEE again!
System Mechanic 6 Professional is an excellent product and it solved all the problems I was having with my computer.  It also alerts you of impending problems. I highly recommends this product.
This book is among seminal works on system safety and safety engineering and should be read by anyone who is entering the field.  One may not necessarily agree with Prof. Leveson's views (e.g. her often unfair and unjustified dismissal of european approaches to safety engineering) but her views in the field are simply too important and influential to be ignored!The book is a good "bed time reading" that gives an overview of the field, major problems and introduction to some major approaches.  It is however not a handbook per se - you will not understand any particular method sufficiently to apply it.Overall, very good introductory text with a good coverage and a very easy and clear language
The computer game version of The Number Devil closely follows the book, as kids progress through sections on prime numbers, the Fibonacci series, Pascal's triangle, and an infinite series approaching one.  Nine of the ten games worked well for us, but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth, the arrow game.  We understood the math, but couldn't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows.  This was disappointing, because we could never reach the bonus section.  All in all, though, this is a good investment for a child, 8 or up, who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers
I purchased Fix-It primarily to correct a registry problem. It was rated very highly on the PCWorld website. It did a great job. I had over 850 registry errors, corrected them and did a reorg on the registry. My computer is running beter now. The other utilities included work as advertised. I have been using Norton Systemworks for many years and this product is very comparable at a lower price
I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around.I have a Core 2 Duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5Ghz, 2 gigs of ram, a Geforce 7600gt and a Western Digital Raptor X 150g HD and Vista Ultimate works flawlessly on my computer. It's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly, I built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net. I play World of Warcraft among some other games and I haven't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software I use as of yet. I've only encountered one problem and that was with my old Soundblaster Live! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support. No big deal, it was about time to get a better one anyway.
I think this is the best version to come out yet. I would have a high end pc if I was to upgrade only software. I would just wait and buy a new pc. Its alot easyer then learning a new operating system and if you enable the adminstrator account and only use your standard accounts to surf the web then it give you some security. The firewall is good in the business versions and there is some good virus software out there. Its got alot more features and run's good's. Device drivers are easyier to load -scott 
This software was easy to install.  The Terms and Conditions of Use are very clearly stated.  I found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me.  The puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood. My one wish is that there were more varied games included.... But it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging..
This is a great product to manage your email, calendar, and contacts.  This program has great power and features and is now much easier to use.
Maybe it's because I was upgrading from an older version -- 2002 -- but I found the new features to be very good.For example... the junk mail feature works better than any other I have used.  It was catching junk from the very beginning, and has missed very few things.  I have only had one thing put in the Junk folder that was not junk email.Also the security features are far superior to the 2002 version.  And the Calendar is more flexible and easier to use.Installation was seemless.  I think it might be a little overpriced, but considering how long I will keep it, it's not too bad
My four-year-old son loved the first Fritz and Chesster so much I just had to get the second.  I would have gotten the third installment as well, but it appears to require a DVD-Rom and more up-to-date software than he has on his computer (I suggest you always review those details before buying).  Like the first, this second installment has the same quirky and artistic sensibility and lots of amusing details that keep me as interested in it as he is.  The first one seemed a lot more "British" than this one.  Just one example: in the first installment, the pawns are often depicted as English villagers with low-brow accents.  In this installment they are more often Texas ranchers... There were also numerous Britishisms in the first installment that were tough to understand for a child.  This one is thankfully free of them.  I suppose the American audience proved more lucrative than the original designers had expected.... I think the suggested age is more 6-or-above (they really should be able to read, I suppose), but with a little help even a younger child (such as my son) can get into most of the exercises and spend time with it.  There are several more advanced  features in this one than in the first installment.  Here the focus is on basic tactics, openings, and endgame situations.  So a child should really have made it through the first one before getting this.  He absolutely has to know all the rules, for instance -- the second installment is not going to teach them.  The first also has some wonderful exercises with just pawns or kings on the board, for instance, that have much to teach.  And some fun games like a maze with a monster chasing you (to teach the rook moves) or a cannon that fires diagonally (to teach the bishop).  Some of the games here (which resemble early video games, like space invaders) are a little too advanced for a four-year-old's manual dexterity....perhaps for a six-year-old's as well.  But there are many things he can get into nonetheless, especially if you take the time to explain things and get them started.Overall, I'd say that if you want to give a child an introduction to the game, nothing beats the first Fritz and Chesster.  Other chess teaching video games are much darker and less helpful, really, for beginners.  And if he or she likes the first installment (which is also very girl-friendly), then by all means advance to the second -- especially for kids over 6
I'm not going to cover the technical drawbacks of this software except to briefly mention that you should look over other reviews before you buy.  However, despite annoying design features, this is quite an amazing piece of software!  I would certainly rate it a 5+ if there weren't some design shortcomings and undocumented features ;)For starters, the educational intent of this software was well thought out.  Young people will certainly learn a lot about chess through using this program and they will have tremendous fun doing it!  The game teaches fairly advanced concepts in very clever and engaging ways for children of all ages and even adults.The graphics and characters are great.  The explanations of principles are sound and they are reinforced through fun chess exercises.  The program encourages young chess players and at the same time challenges them to improve.The product description above covers the scope of the concepts covered in detail and I found this description to be accurate so I won't repeat it.  I spent about 2 hours with a 9 year old playing the game and I had a lot of fun!I didn't find that this program was especially difficult to use and my young friend was able to figure it out intuitively.  He also found it difficult to pull himself away and so did I.  This definitely an activity you can enjoy along with your children.The overall concept for this teaching tool is interesting because it involves three layers of play.  There is the overall game of rescuing the king who is trapped in the castle which is used as a tool to motivate the player to learn new chess skills that allow them to progress in this higher order game.  Embedded within this larger framework are a number of clever chess teaching games where you can record high scores and learn various skills.  These can be selected from within an animated room, which gives the player some freedom of choice.  Additionally, there are other fun games that are not necessarily related to chess, but that allow the player to relax their chess concentration and refresh themselves for tackling more difficult chess skills challenges.I also think it's good that kids could join [...] for a year and play against others as part of the purchase price.  This gives them an arena to apply their chess knowledge and is a good community that is always available.  There are other online chess communities that are free, but I still think this is a nice added bonus.I don't think any parent could go wrong purchasing this software for their child.  It's good for hundreds or even thousands of hours of entertainment and its powered by an excellent chess engine.  However, you can't play a game of chess against the computer with it.  It is ONLY a teaching tool.  However, you can buy Fritz Grandmaster Software for about [...] which does have this capability at a very low price point compared to other products of comparable playing ability.  I've heard criticisms of Fritz 9 and my understanding is the extra cost does not add a lot of value.  In fact, at this point there seems to be some bugs with Fritz 9.If you purchase this product, you won't be disappointed.  I wish they had it when I was learning to play chess
Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 2, continues where the first CD left off.  Like the first CD, this program may take some guessing regarding what exactly is one supposed to do, and clicking on the crown in the upper right corner helps to navigate through the game.  This program is really good for grasping the basic tactics and strategies because your progress is measured and you have to develop certain skill proficiency before moving to higher level and learning more tactics and strategies.The CD covers some popular opening moves, middle game tactics like pins, forks, skewers and deflection, and mating strategies in end game.  With practice on this CD, you can begin to win some games, and then move on to Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 3, which is out in German, and is supposed to be out soon in English
This is an excellent product for kids. My kid loves to learn with this software. I had issues installing this product. Other than installation issues, it has been excellent. We are having fun now!I will recommend this title for kids starting on chess
Although this game maybe aimed for kids, it can still offer powerful training games in an entertaining way. Each assorted machines is like an arcade that trains each tactical aspects individually. Such as blind Chess, eye-training, memory training of chess positions are most notable that separates it from the other beginner chess training programs. The only thing I hate bout this game is the lack of options. You can't log off to a different username without having to shutdown the program first then relog nor can you delete usernames. No BGMs (backgroundmusic)during chess matches. Other than that, its an awesome tactical training tool. Kids really do love to play this game and is one of the best games out there that can get them into playing Chess. I think Chess can be a beneficial contribution to school learning and thinking process.
My children absolutely love this version. They wake at 5 a.m. to play before school. My son says "it's great--I've learned lots of tips, and now I'm a much better chess player." Why a 4-star and not 5? The down-side--the game doesn't allow the player to "save" at a certain level--totally frustrates the kids when they want to return, they have to start at the beginning again
My kids (6 and 8) are learning so much from Fritz and Chesster 2!!  In fact, my 6 year old daughter started winning a few games at their local chess club after graduating to this game (from Fritz and Chesster 1).  Today I decided to play with them (since they don't like to play against each other - they're still working on that "good sportsmanship" thing), and I let them team up against me.  I was viewing this as an opportunity to help them think ahead, predict moves, and protect their pieces.  However, I was the one who learned!!  They surprised me again and again by reciting strategies (move your bishops and knights out, save your Queen for the real battle, don't move your pawns willy nilly, break your oponnent's wall, etc...) they had learned from this game.They also knew the relative value of the pieces, but could see advantages to making uneven swaps sometimes.  For example, they shocked me by sacrificing a bishop for a pawn in order to open a hole in my wall, which they later exploited to checkmate my  king.  This was a strategy that even 1 month ago would have been unthinkable to them.Anyway, I defer to other more experienced chess players and computer users who have made specific comments about graphics, dialogue, and strategies.  I am sure that at some point, my kids will move beyond this game and what it has to offer.  But for now I couldn't be happier with the Chesster and Fritz games!  My kids absolutely love playing the computer games and are really learning to play chess - and not just "computer chess", but chess that lets them beat other kids at chess club - not to mention me.  I think I'm going to go demand a rematch :)
I bought this based on the Amazon reviews.  I am extremely new at this but the software is pretty good.  The teacher is somewhat annoying and as another reviewer said, he sings over his playing way too much.  I wish there was a way to turn him WAY down and the guitar up.  It touts having over 160 lessons, but that is somewhat misleading.  I don't doubt it has over 160 pages, but I covered 23 "lessons" in about an hour.  I do like the fact that the first few lessons he teaches you very easy versions of the chords so you don't feel hung up on doing the full chords when your fingers don't  want to move to strange new positions they aren't used to.  I am using this as well as Fender's DVD for acoustic with Keith Wyatt.  The DVD is a little more challenging for me, but Keith Wyatt is much better than the guy from the eMedia software (and he doesn't feel the need to sing!!!).  Overall, I would recommend this software
Great deal, great price, great product. Emedia Guitar method is by far one of the greatest computer learn to play programs out there. My order netted me a brand new, factory fresh product, securely and quickly shipped. Thanks, again
Well presented, easy to follow along, and easy to revisit previous lessons.  Videos and illustrated fretboard really help see and hear how the song should be played.  Not a lot of depth in the material but probably about the right level to maintain the attention of most students.  Some of the accompanyment/singing could be better but overall does a good job presenting the music so the student can practice along. Some of the material/songs may not be to everyones liking, but again, these are okay for the beginner.  The singing can be a slight destraction sometimes. I probably wouldn't recommend this to be the only source of learning guitar....and I don't think most people buying it would think it's all the will every need to become a great guitar player.  I'm sure a teacher would still be very advantageous especially when it comes to pointing out bad habits that may creep into the new students technique. I'm trying to learn without a teacher as well and have found other music books very useful.  Bottom line;  This is a good product and provides a good start at learning to play the guitar.
I was sceptical about buying this product after reading one of the reveiws about having some trouble with Quicktime. Anyways, I had no problems with this program at all. Guitar is my favorite instrument. I've always wanted to learn how to play guitar. I even bought the cheap $10 dollar videos that basically rush through everything and left me frustrated, and playing the chords all wrong. This video is SO MUCH FUN!!!! I thought I could never play guitar after being so discouraged from learning from other videos. I figured, ok, this is a little more expensive, but at least I will learn how to play over 70 songs!!! I'm so happy that I bought this video. It is worth every penny. I'm currently on the 42nd lesson. Mind you, this video is not one of those "we move along quickly, so if you didn't get it, just rewind" videos. Oh no, this video makes you practice the chords many times so it's in your head. When you're done with this video, you'll feel so confindent. It's like having your own private instructor. Certain things I was doing wrong I no longer do. It has even cleaned up my fingering technique. I have no more words, it's a great video and you can't go wrong with Amazon's price.Thank you
My 5 and 6-year olds didn't seem to want to play, maybe too hard. I enjoyed playing and my 11-year old twins really liked it
Really great!  Beautiful graphics, easy to follow instructions, levels to keep us going.  Very fun and challenging
My five and six year old love this game! It sparks their interest in things around them and now we play our own "I Spy" riddles in the car, at dinner or out on walks.  I highly recommend it
I bought this for a boy of 12 who goes to school in German.  He speaks English at home with his mother.  I think that  this game  will help him with his English
With 20 grandkids and 3 great grandkids, I have spent many hours with them playing games on the comptuer.  Almost all of them like all types of games, but the I Spy Series is one of the most played series that I have.  The I SPY TREASURE HUNT notes ages 6 to 10 and they must have done a lot of testing to be able to devlop a game that is actually challenging and interesting for adults,  and yet can actually be played by young kids as well.  The I Spy series has always had very hight quality games, and this is at the top of the list for me.  I will warn you though, that if you play with your kids, be prepaired to surprised. My usual play is for me to help the kids search, and not find items and tell them, but if they get stuck, point out an area to look at.  With this one, I have a seven year old that was finishing finding the last 4 or five items before I could find even one of them.  Great play for everyone.  Super recommended
This item was delivered in a timely manner and my son really enjoyed it. Thanks
I purchased this game for my 3 year old who already reads a little and knows her numbers well. I hoped this game would help her learn addition. She loves to play it, but several of the games require hand coordination beyond her ability (the hand cart one in particular, as noted by another reviewer), and catching bubbles. It was frustrating to me because she knew the proper answer but could not "execute" because her movements were too slow. Over time, she has improved enough to play most of the games on level one. The game is very engaging ang the graphics well-done, but the educational part is under-emphasized. The game that "teaches" addition involves frogs jumping to lily-pads and my daughter is so focused on the frogs that the addition lesson is hardly noticed
I was amazed how colorful the graphics are in this game.  My 6 year took right to it and played it for 2 hours the first sitting.  She mastered level 2 pretty easy and is on to level 3.  Our computer runs windows and we have had no problems.  This is a great game to buy for the summer to keep kids up to speed between K and 1st grade
Finally, fresh new characters which are adorable. I am a converted Kutoka buyer as I have now bought a 3rd item from them. I was so impressed with the Mia Reading and Mia Language that I wanted to try this multi-subject game for my twin girls in kindergarten. This game is a great compliment to mia reading as it reinforces literacy and other subjects like math and problem solving. We haven't played with the art part yet but I still think it's a great value for the other subjects. I'm really impressed how it helps to develop their cognitive skills and patience as one of my girls has a problem with concentration but found through the problem solving activities that she is overcoming these difficulties. Great product. Even my neighbours kids come over to play it!
(Responding to Joel G's review below)It's unfortunate that your child was unable to enjoy Didi  Ditto because of a technical problem you had with your computer. The majority of Didi  Ditto players are running Microsoft Windows and enjoying this great educational software.If you send us an e-mail message at service@kutoka.com, I am sure that someone from our technical support team will be able to help you resolve the issue you seem to have experienced with your computer display.Also note that all activites can be unlocked in the Activities menu by pressing the F6 key on your keyboard. A full list of the game's keyboard shortcuts can be found in the user's guide which is accessible from the Start menu.Hope this helps
My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas present.  He has really enjoyed playing it so far.  He can do most of the activities without help.  There is one part where you have to ride a cart down a mountain and click buttons to duck or jump, which I think is pretty hard for little ones (it actually took me a couple of tries to make it down the mountain).  There are many different learning activities:  matching, memory, shapes, size, etc. We did not have any problems loading the game on our computer as another reviewer did.  We have a new Dell computer running on windows XP
The upgrade presents a good value for a Vista-compatible product that includes improvements to ease of use, particularly for combining documents into a single PDF.
Adobe Standard 8.0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions. If you do research and want a better interface, design and functions then you need this new version of Adobe. It is an incredible tool for gathering, sorting, copying and formatting information. It also is faster than older versions. See details (above) on Amazon. Recommended for all information-knowledge workers
The operating system is a very good operating system for a home computer.  But, obviously, if you want a computer with more security features or networking features, you should go with Windows XP Professional.  At the time that I am writing this, which is a long time from when I purchased Windows XP, it is a time where Windows Vista is emerging.  If you plan on upgrading a slightly older computer, I recommend Windows XP Home/Professional (based on your requirements).  But if you are looking for a safe operating system for your beast, try Windows Vista.  But one word of warning about Vista, the User Account Control (UAC) is a pain in the butt
Rosetta Stone Spanish is the third major Spanish course that I am buying. I have comtpleted all of the Spanish lessons in the Pimsleur series, and have also completed Learning Spanish Like Crazy Level One and Two. I am one of those rare Latinas that did not learn Spanish from my parents. My Mexican parents felt that it would be easier to "assimilate" if I only spoke English. After going to my grandparents' home for holidays and being the only one there that did not speak Spanish, and after having Latino strangers speak to me in Spanish and then look at me in astonishment when I struggled just to say "no, hablo espanol," I felt that it was time for me to learn how to speak my language. The first course that I used was Pimsleur Spanish. Compared to Rosetta Stone I must say that I learned much more vocabulary with the Rosetta Stone software. But I recommend Pimsleur over Rosetta Stone, especially for the complete beginner. Because of its easy teaching method, in my opinion Pimsleur is even better than LSLC for someone that has no experience whatsoever speaking Spanish. Pimsluer goes at a very slow pace. But if you have already learned some Spanish on your own or in high school or college, then you can probably skip Pismleur and go straight to LSLC. Or if you are the type of person that believes learning a foreign language should be more like a hurdle than a marathon you'll probably want to go with Learning Spanish Like Crazy. LSLC covers a lot more Spanish words and grammar than Pimsleur and moves at a quicker pace. So where does Rosetta Stone fit in? I would say use Rosetta Stone after you have completed the above courses. It is difficult to really learn how to speak Spanish with this software alone because you are only looking at pictures and repeating the phrases that you hear. You never really learn how to think in Spanish and create your own sentences. So why am I still giving it 4 stars? Because if you already know how to speak some Spanish from another course and you are on an intermediate level then you can add plenty more Spanish words to your vocabulary by using the Rosetta Stone software. One negative about this course is that the method is tedious because the software's interface is "antiquated" with photos from the 1980s. And the sound quality is not as clear as Pimsleur or Learning Spanish Like Crazy. But if you stick it out through the drudgery, you will be surprised with how many Spanish words you learned with this software. But I think Pimsleur did a better job of teaching me concepts than this software is doing. And by teaching me concepts, I have really retained the material and by understanding concepts, I am able to take my own thoughts and form sentences. Something that I would not have been able to do if I had used this course alone. Another negative about this course, is that unlike the other two courses that I mentioned, you have to use Rosetta Stone while sitting in a computer. That is difficult for me because I am very busy with classes, work and my personal life. I can use Pimsleur or LSLC on my mp3 player and not have to worry about sitting at a computer. Besides the limited vocabulary and the slow teaching method, the only downside of Pimsleur is that it does not teach the same Spanish words that are most commonly used by Mexicans and other Latinos in regular conversation. Pimsleur Spanish is very formal Spanish. We say "mucho gusto" like LSLC teaches, Pimsleur teaches "encantado." And in our overly "macho" culture if a man responds with "encantado" many Latinos may get the wrong impression about him. It is not something that I am proud to say about my (Latino) culture, but it is true. And Pimsleur does not warn the male student that if you say "encantado" to some Latinos they may get the wrong impression about the speaker. Learning Spanish Like Crazy has taught me useful practical Spanish that I can use to communicate with my Spanish speaking friends and family. When I tell people that I learned to speak Spanish as an adult and not at home as a child, many of them do not believe me. I think they find it incredible for two reasons: One, my accent really sounds like a native Speaker from using LSLC. Two, I have learned real conversational Spanish from LSLC. I have learned words and phrases that Spanish speakers actually use when speaking to each other. PImsleur taught me Spanish that the author of the course thought that I should speak, not the Spanish that Latinos really speak. That is one of the positive things that separates LSLC course from the others. So in what order would I rate the three in terms of EASE of teaching method: 1. Pimsleur Spanish 2. Learning Spanish Like Crazy 3. Rosetta Stone Spanish But in terms of teaching real conversational Spanish and teaching a real Latin American accent, I rate them as follows: 1. Learning Spanish Like Crazy 2. Pimsleur Spanish 3. Rosetta Stone Spanish 
I was pleaed at how quickly I began to pick up on the language.  I plan to purchase other Rosetta Stone Products in the futur
This language learning software is the best I have ever tried.  You can work with the Lesson material in several different ways, utilizing your favorite method of learning.  Expecially great is the speaking unit which allows you to match your pronunciation with that of the instructor.  The package is well worth the cost
this is a great language learning program- you get going on it and before you know it you are ten lessons ahead. i've learned a lot already
My husband is using the Rosetta Stone Spanish program and loves it
It was a relief for me to be able to keep and upgrade Word and Excel, and to get Virtual PC (for Access) as well. I used them a lot on my PC a few years ago, and when I first switched to Mac, couldn't find software that did what they did. I had no trouble installing the upgrade on my iMac G5, nor did I have trouble installing Virtual PC. The only thing that WAS disappointing was that I couldn't find out whether accessing the Internet from Virtual PC would open me up to PC-type viruses, or if Mac's Unix system would protect me there, too.  I continue to be disappointed that the Mac version of this software is not as rich as the PC version. But the upgrade itself worked well for what it was meant to do
A great bargain - you get full office Professional, VP and full version of Windows for under $300 dollars. After waiting for months and months for Office 2004 Professional to be released, when it finally came out I was ecstatic. One problem: VP 7.0 wouldn't install on my G5, only on my laptop. I called Microsoft support and within minutes they told me that they were working on a patch for machines with over 2.0 GB of ram. I downloaded the update a week later when it came out and everything is now golden. The moral of the story is that Microsoft underestimates the needs of Mac users because they are used to wimpy PCs that have no ram
The Rosetta Stone language software was a great investment. The product provides learning words together with listening, seeing, and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases. It provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace. The product has been worth it's hefty price. I do recommend purchasing a German/English dictionary to accompany the  software. I have also had in the past a basic German 101 course prior to using Rosetta Stone, so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the German language, such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings
I tried an inexpensive program first and found it just didn't work. This program has been fantastic!
I first heard about this product in a bad review of a different software product for converting LPs to CDs.  After a little research, I decided to try this product of the many that are out there.  This software is not expensive and for me, it does what I expected it to do.  It is easy to set up and use, and I am using it with an Audio-Technica PL120 turntable.  The first LP I converted was Stevie Wonder's Innervisions, and with this album in particular, the songs run together, i.e. there is no separation between the tracks.  This software allowed me to create fairly accurate tracks so I could access individual songs.  I also cleaned up some background noise with the "one click" noise reduction, and the music from this old album sounds great.  This is my first software for this purpose so unfortunately I cannot compare it to others.  What I can tell you is that it is inexpensive, easy to use, and it does what it says it will do
I purchased this product to put 2 CDs together.  I had never attempted something like this and was a total novice.  Audio Cleaning Lab was terrific!  I found it easy to understand and use, with unexpected options that improved the project I was working on. My one word to describe it--- simple....or maybe...effective...or maybe...straightforward...or maybe...uncomplicated...or maybe...useful...or maybe...valuable...or maybe..
I came across Magix Audio Cleaning Lab about 4 years ago.  Once I got the hang of it, I really liked it.  However, I kept wondering if there were better programs out there.  I mean, really, how good can it be for $39, right?  I recently paid $75 for Sony's famed Sound Forge Studio (which is the Sound Forge program minus various some features).  I spent a lot of time with Sound Forge Studio, working to perfect my transfer of some private music recordings from cassette to CD.  I was happy with what I was able to accomplish with Sound Forge.  At least I thought I was happy.  I compared my work in Sound Forge Studio to the same cassette transfer I did with Magix Audio Cleaning Lab 10 (the previous iteration of this software).  Guess what?  I liked the Magix work much better.  So, I immediately purchased Audio Cleaning Lab 11 and unintalled Sony's Sound Forge Studeio from my computer.  Magix could charge $150 for this software and I would buy it in a second.  Your going to have to take the time to carefully read through the full manual to get the most out of this software - but it is worth the effort.  This program does the work of software costing 3 times as much. 
The main reason for negative reviews in the past was the extra charge for the MP3 encoder. With this version, the MP3 encoder is included. Magix has been pretty clever in designing an interface that can used quickly yet has several more advanced features you can use as you become more proficient. These include a full featured waveform editor and a very powerful sonagram (spectral) editor. Also, somewhat hidden is the ability to record 78rpm records on a 33 1/3 turntable. If you use the full set of features almost any record can be made totally free of pops and clicks. I have two very minor negatives; the amplitude scale on the track display is somewhat truncated, the declicker has so few artifacts  that I recommend always using it at the maximum setting (as opposed to the wizard and manual recommendations.) As far as PC requirements, I believe any program that does a lot of number crunching needs a fairly up-to-date processor. This one particularly so because it leaves the original audio files intact. I don't believe this is a negative as in some prior reviews. In short, I have been totally satisfied with this program's ability to make clean transfers of both 78rpm and 33 1/3 rpm records.
In my opionion, Act! is clearly still the best contact manager on the market. I am not talking about a complex CRM solution, but it is a fine contact manager. I am not using the Outlook and Palm interfaces and I don't have any complains other than it is slow if you are running many programs at the same time.The built in email features are okay, seach features are excellent. Just give it a 30 day trial and compare to Goldmine, Maximizer and others
With this software you can create a 2-D or 3-D game.Follow the tutorial you can download from www.thegamecreators.com (producers of the software) and you will create a real game in about 2 weeks of nights.[...]This box is the FULL package [...] The software is not as fully supported as the professional version, but for a hobbiest, it is perfect
I own Hallmark Card Studio 2006, and this product is a different, interesting addition to greeting-card-making.  It has lots of kinds of pictures, i.e., aquatic mammals/fish, etc, for making "fun" children's cards
This is another great card making product but I don't believe as good as Hallmark. But? I still use it a whole lot and love it! I know you will too! Try it out! And take a chance on a great product
I think this is actually a very good OS. There are a lot of new features and Home Premium appears to be the best Vista OS for the money. I purhased a new PC with this OS and have really found no compelling reason to upgrade to Ultimate for $150. Only legitimate gripe concerns drivers for non-microsoft products. Not excatly sure why this is microsoft's problem though. Regardless, this OS is the smart choice for a new PC for home use. Accept a minimum required graphics and audio card until suppliers catch up with this new OS. Then upgrade. Otherwise, wait till you need a new PC
Like the new look but am having problems making the transition.Jury still out
If you've been living under a rock for the past year or so, perhaps you can be excused for not having heard about Microsoft's new edition to the Windows canon.  For all others, Vista has become a fact of life, whether or not you actually run the operating system yet.  Check out a tech website and you'll find a Vista screen shot somewhere, either depicting some impressive overclocking results via CPU-Z, or else simply for no other purpose than to show the world, "Yes, I can run Aero--aren't you jealous?"  In fact, it's hard to avoid Vista these days.  And, as always seems to be the case, most of what you hear is probably negative.That's where I come in.  I've waited a while before writing this review, both to test the operating system and to wait for the horror stories to fade away.  They haven't.  And this can only mean one thing: the positive stories aren't getting through because most people who are satisfied with a product generally don't feel the need to comment on it.  Now of course you've probably seen quite a few anxious posts (most likely in all capital letters) either bashing Microsoft for everything under the sun, praising Vista indiscriminately, making it seem as though you need a $5000.00 enthusiast-class computer to run the thing, or boasting about Mac's venerable OS X and how Windows Vista is nothing more than a bad copy thereof.  Needless to say, none of these sorts of things helps, and all of them create a sense of confusion and negativity that reflects heavily on the product.  And, if you analyze them closely, you'll realize that *none of them actually says anything about Windows Vista.*  If you don't believe me, then just go visit Apple's discussion area and check out the iPod pages.  You'd get the impression that iPods were the worst products ever made and that every single one has problems.  Yet, if this were the case, then why have in excess of 100 million units been sold thus far?  The answer is obvious: people seem compelled to review products only if something went wrong with their experience.  In short, people confuse review sites with complaint forums.Therefore, as the self-proclaimed Dr. Prog, I feel it my duty to step out of my usual mode of reviewing progressive rock albums and give an honest, no nonsense review of Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium.-THE INTERFACE-Ah, yes.  You've heard all about the new Windows Vista Aero interface by now.  And virtually every screen shot you'll ever see will feature Aero.  But it's much more than just pretty, glass-like window frames.  Aero includes many new enhancements to the UI, such as the live thumbnails that appear when you mouse-over minimized windows.  As the name suggests, these actually update in real time, so if there is a video or an animation playing in the window, it will appear in the live thumbnail.  This is very useful.  Perhaps less useful but scoring about an 8 on the 1-10 "coolness factor" scale is the oft-mentioned 3D-Flip, which allows the user to view a three-dimensional representation of all open windows, along with offering the ability to virtually paw through these to bring the desired window to the forefront.  These are the things you'll hear the most about.What you don't hear so much is all the general changes that have been made to the overall interface.  The new icons are photo-realistic and size-scalable.  They start out a little large, but you can set them to any size within a wide spectrum.  The explorer windows have been radically redressed, with a new breadcrumbs backward navigation tool that beats the old address bar hands down (you can retrace your steps in a logical, step-by-step manner, instead of using the cryptic addresses).  Also, they're spruced up with decorations that recall the visual aura style of some of the new wallpapers.  Speaking of which, these are for the first time actually usable, unlike in previous versions of Windows, where the wallpapers have been small and grainy.More general changes include the absence of menu bars in most areas of Explorer, including IE.  These can be replaced momentarily with a tap of the Alt key, at least until you learn how to navigate without them.  Also, the animations are much better than in previous versions of Windows, particularly the one you see when copying a file.  In addition, the Start menu has been reworked drastically.  It doesn't even say "Start," anymore; instead, it's simply a blue orb with the Windows logo.  The first big change is the way programs are accessed: gone is the delicate and finicky ever-expanding hierarchy system, where a slightly overzealous hand could miss the mark and close the entire desired level.  Now, the All Programs button leads to an Explorer-like listing of folders, each clearly named, and each of which opens and closes with a single mouse click.  Each time the Start menu is opened, the folders reset themselves.  Also, they are automatically alphabetized.  The Start menu also contains most of the system links usually found on the Desktop (Computer, Documents, etc.), which is why the only thing on the Desktop the first time you boot up is the Recycle Bin.  And, in case you have seen screen shots or have tried out Vista already, the search bar at the bottom pulls double duty as a replacement for the Run command utility.Speaking of search, though I seldom ever find myself wondering where my files are (I suppose I'm unique in this respect), many people have far more data to keep track of than me, and thus they will greatly appreciate the enhanced and pervasive searching facilities of Vista.  There are search boxes virtually everywhere in Explorer, including the Start menu.  There is even one in IE7, though it is not integrated with the system search.But, as you've probably noticed, this is but a list of interface changes and additions.  I assure you the list could go on and on, and I know I'll receive more than one comment reminding me about some feature or other I've forgotten.  I'll read those when they come and add material as necessary.  But, aside from this, how does this new interface really impact the end user?  To be perfectly honest, though it's certainly pretty and a few parts of it required a little adjustment, it didn't feel much different from previous Windows versions to me.  But, to be honest, this is a good thing.  Perhaps you've heard that it's a nightmare to learn Vista.  That's a load of hogwash.  A few things are renamed, a few things have been moved around, and on the whole everything looks prettier.  But it's still Windows; it accomplishes the same tasks and it works virtually the same as it always did.-INCLUDED SOFTWARE BUNDLE-Taking a hint from Apple, Microsoft has included a compliment of digital media manipulation software.  While of course iLife is superior, there is one issue that must be cleared up: iLife is not an integral part of Mac OS X as you may have been led to believe.  Older Mac users must purchase it; it only comes with the newer Macs.  Therefore, Microsoft Windows Vista, to be purely technical, offers the most comprehensive digital media suite ever offered stock with an OS.  However, technicality is seldom practical, and Microsoft's inclusion is no iLife killer.  Still, the included calendar (new in Vista), photo viewing and editing application (new), Windows Media Player 11, Windows Movie Maker, and Windows DVD burning program (new) are nothing to scoff at.  No, they won't replace dedicated, professional stand-alone programs, but let's be honest: neither will iLife.The new Internet Explorer 7 is a step forward from the piece of Swiss cheese IE6 was, insofar as security.  New features include a phishing filter, tabbed browsing, and improved security.  Additionally, IE7 runs in protected mode, also called a "sandbox."  The idea is that this one application is cordoned off from the rest of the system, thereby making it more difficult for malicious software to take control of your computer.  But that's more for the security section of the review.  The new IE7 is certainly more attractive than the older versions, and the version in Vista offers enhanced visual appeal that the XP port of the software lacks.  To be perfectly honest, I still use Mozilla Firefox (mostly because I can't stand those blinking ads on Web pages, and there is a Firefox extension that gets rid of that annoyance once and for all), but if I had to, I would have no qualms using IE7. The new incarnation of Window Media Player is really no different from the XP port.  It still doesn't support AAC, and it still doesn't handle gapless playback.  As an iPod user and a progressive rock fan, respectively, I can gather only one thing from these shortcomings: it's time to break out iTunes.  Don't get me wrong: WMP is not at all a bad tool.  It's still the default player on my system for most audio types.  However, once an iPod owner and prog rocker, always an iPod owner/progger.  I still say iTunes is king, if only because its interface is cleaner, it supports my audio device, and it offers gapless playback.I haven't extensively tested the Windows Movie Maker application, but I have read that it is updated very slightly from the XP version.  The photo  editing tool is completely new for Vista, and after a little experimenting I was pleased that, though simple, the controls offer nice results.  This  application is on par with many of the basic image editing software packages you'll see offered with digital cameras, printers, and the like.  The other applications have yet to receive my testing, only because I don't often burn DVD movies, and I haven't entered an event in a calendar in about ten years.As far as Windows Mail, I cannot be objective because I have never used Outlook or Outlook Express.  Reports seem to indicate that Windows Mail is simply a dressed-up Outlook Express, with many of the same features.  As I said, I have never used a mail program.  Call me old-fashioned, but I just check and write my mail from my Internet browser.  Either way, I don't honestly believe Microsoft would offer Outlook-level functionality in the stripped down version of Outlook 2007.All in all, I was rather impressed at the steps Microsoft has taken to embrace the digital media age.  The effort falls short of iLife and proprietary solutions in this regard, but then, that is simply to be expected.  I haven't really benefited tremendously from the new additions, but there is certainly nothing wrong with them, and I know many people will be very happy with this digital media suite.-SECURITY-This is the big picking point many people (rightfully) have with Windows XP.  It seems as though there's at least two critical security updates every week.  The Mac commercials definitely have a point, but that's only because Macs make up so small a percentage of the market share (though it is indeed a growing share) that it is not advantageous for malware to be written for OS X users.  Even so, XP doesn't get a free pass here.  Something had to be done.  And that something was the security measures taken in Windows Vista.The "sandbox" has already been mentioned above, but other features have been added.  One of these, Windows Defender (Microsoft's anti-spyware program), is one of those rare pieces of software that is just perfect: It may not be the best at what it does, but it's unobtrusive, it's simple to use, and it's totally and completely free.  Leave it on to supplement your already existing spyware solution, and you can only benefit.Also featured in Vista is the now infamous User Account Control (UAC).  Basically, it prompts you every time your computer does basically anything, including installing programs, running some programs, updating settings, etc.  And, if you were wondering, the Mac commercials have it right: It really is that annoying.  To be fair, you will see far fewer of these alerts once the bulk of your software has been installed, but until then you will be very, very sick of UAC.  I don't advise this, but since I was able to get my anti-virus and anti-spyware software up and running on Vista, I finally turned off UAC.  Symantic seems to think this was unwise, but Norton Virus Scan doesn't bother me about it other than to recommend, on its information page, that I leave UAC activated.  Yeah.  Like that's going to happen.Beyond these broad, tangible aspects of security, there is a lot of new stuff under the hood of Vista that makes it less susceptible to malicious attacks.  Mostly, unless you're very savvy, you don't need to understand it all and, to be frank, don't ask me because I haven't the foggiest how it all works.  I'm just glad it's there.Overall, I think Microsoft has made a valiant effort with security.  I would still not advise running any Windows operating system without active virus and spyware protection, but at least Vista has taken a step in the right direction.  Plus, you likely have anti-virus and anti-spyware software from running Windows XP, which you can then install on Vista.-THE HARDWARE-Graphics:This is the part I have been waiting for.  Everything I read up until I finally installed Vista told me I needed a dedicated graphics card with at least 256 MB of memory in order to run Aero.  I'll be honest: I fell for it.  I had a graphics card *in my hand*, but on the way to the checkout I realized I had left my gift certificate at home.  So I decided to wait and see how my hardware would react.  This is where I realized the utter bias among the tech community: I had absolutely no trouble running Aero on integrated graphics.  And that only makes sense because my setup is rather typical: a 17" flat panel monitor and a modern computer.  This will be what the majority of people have at the moment, and at this size, IG should have no trouble running Aero.  Now use logic: If you want to run dual 24" widescreen monitors, yeah, you'll need a graphics card.  Especially since I don't believe there even exists a dual monitor-capable IG motherboard (if there is such a thing, it's certainly not available on the OEM consumer market).  But if you have a fairly typical single monitor scenario on a computer that you bought within the past few years, you should have no trouble at all insofar as graphics.  Don't be fooled.  If you want to be absolutely sure, however, there is no harm--and plenty of good sense--in downloading Microsoft's free Upgrade Advisor utility to see if your setup is in any way deficient.  Plus, if you find you can't run Aero for any reason, you were going to upgrade to Vista anyway, so you  can still buy dedicated graphics at that point.  You don't need the top-of-the-line card unless you want to make this an excuse to foray into gaming; older technology that will get you up and running can be had for very reasonable prices.RAM:There is one area, however, where many computers will be deficient: RAM.  Oddly enough, while many sources are pushing the graphics card brigade, an almost equally strong force--the computer manufacturers themselves--seems to think that RAM is no big deal.  Trust me: If you've ever tried to run Windows XP on 256 MB of RAM, it's a painful experience.  That's what Vista is like on 512 MB--you don't even want to go there.  Dell is shockingly honest when they qualify the "minimum" Vista requirement of 512 MB of RAM (as per Microsoft) as "Great for booting the operating system, without running any applications or games."  This is where most people will have to upgrade their machines.  1 GB is perfectly acceptable; if you want true multitasking power (and you have the dual-core processor to support it), then go for 2 GB or more.  For most people, however, 1 GB will be fine.  My first of two Vista machines has 1 GB and it works perfectly.  I will warn you, though, that often times memory is installed in pairs, so your 512 MB is most likely two 256 MB modules.  The paired method offers better performance, but it will make upgrading a system with only two memory slots somewhat expensive (though not exorbitant by any means).  But this is not somewhere you want to skimp, so at least one pair of 512 MB memory modules should be on your list of extra hardware if you have only 512 MB of memory currently installed.Processor:This is perhaps the most accurate in terms of the hype.  You'll need at least a 1 GHz processor to run Aero.  Many computers with such processors don't even support 1 GB of RAM, so if you're in that situation, you will definitely be looking at a new computer with Vista pre-installed.  However, these are very old machines by this point, and most of us have something slightly newer.  One myth that needs to be dispelled is that dual-core processors will run Vista better than single-core CPUs: Vista is, for the most part, based on the Microsoft Server 2003 code, which is, in turn, based on the XP code, both of which came before the advent of multi-core processing.  Therefore, to the effect that the operating system is run, there will be only a marginal difference between a single-core or a dual-core CPU, provided both use identical core architectures.  Of course any applications that take advantage of multi-threading will benefit from multiple cores, but this was, is, and will always be the case, independent of the operating system.  The question is simply whether you see yourself multitasking more with Vista.  If that's the case, then a new computer with a dual-core processor installed is probably your best bet; if you're fine with your current setup, then it will most likely run Vista and Aero without any problems.  It is interesting to note, however, that some upgrade aptitude utilities have some small quirks and will give conflicting and non-real results.  For example, such a utility offered by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) passed both my A64 X2-based machines without a hitch.  However, when on a whim I ran it on my old P4-based desktop, the utility seemed to think that a 2.40B GHz Pentium 4 Northwood (533 FSB) would be insufficient to run Vista.  I smell AMD bias, even though I happen to favor AMD over Intel.  Just take what such utilities tell you with a grain of salt, and remember that Microsoft's own utility is likely the most reliable.  Generally, your processor will not be an issue when upgrading to Vista.Hard Drive:Again, this one is pretty straightforward.  If you have a 40 GB hard drive or better, you're good to go.  And if you don't have that, hard drives are so cheap these days that you could easily at least triple your current capacity for about what it costs to take the family out to dinner one evening (Amazon does not allow price figures, hence my vagueness regarding pricing throughout this review).Things get interesting when you consider a dual boot scenario.  This is when you have two operating systems running on the same system, either on the same or on different hard drives.  In my honest opinion, this is the best way to go because you get to keep your current operating system (just in case you run into problems with Vista), and you also get to have Vista.  Keep in mind that, in order to run Vista on the same hard drive as your current OS, you'll need to install each OS on a separate partition.  You can either purchase a third party partitioning tool, or do what I did, which was use the Ubuntu Linux live boot disc's built-in partitioning utility.  Of course there is risk involved with this last solution (but, in my experience, I've used it dozens of times with no problems), so do the latter only at your own risk.-COMPATIBILITY-This is where most of the horror stories have come from.  Both hardware and software compatibility nightmares are flitting around in denser clusters than fish flies in June.  Up until recently, anti-virus and anti-spyware programs have been unable to install on Vista.  In addition, many proprietary printer applications are incompatible, yet the printer itself will often times function perfectly.  Graphics and sound card drivers still haven't really caught up, despite the fact that they've had a little over two years to do so.  I won't deny that, if your system just happens to roll the snake eyes, you're in for some hell.But it's not half as bad as you hear.  I installed Vista without a hitch; there is a separate part of the process where the OS scans the system for hardware, installs the necessary drivers, and then generates a list of anything that doesn't install properly.  Every piece of hardware I had was recognized.  In addition, my printer was recognized and installed in about five seconds, despite the fact that its own software would not install (and that its maker, HP, still hadn't posted a Vista-compatible version).  Even my USB Internet modem, which the Upgrade Advisor flat out said would not work with Vista, installed and ran perfectly when I supplied the drivers from the manufacturer's website.  The fact is, Vista has shipped with exponentially more drivers than any edition of XP.  Plus, it's possible to supply drivers from manufacturers' websites for the odd, esoteric bit of hardware that isn't immediately detected.  Sometimes it will work, sometimes not.  But this is only to be expected when upgrading to a new OS.  I don't seem to remember everything being rosy when XP came out, either.  This is yet another item of strong support for a dual boot scenario.Software is no different from hardware.  All my software titles, with the possible exception of the ancient original Roller Coaster Tycoon, work flawlessly with Vista.  And the latter didn't work with Windows XP MCE 2005, either, so I don't blame Vista for this.  If your software acts buggy or otherwise just won't work, check the manufacturer's website.  If it's a fairly recent title, there will most likely be some compatibility patches or a whole new version of the application, all free of charge.  Just be ready to insert your product key, if required, in the latter case.  Now of course chances are that if you have some pet application from the mid-nineties, it might kick up a few Dickens.  Again, a strong case for dual boot.The final and perhaps most prolific source of upgrade hell is, ironically, the upgrade itself.  This process works by performing an in-place upgrade of an already existing operating system (XP).  These sorts of upgrades are notorious for problems, and the Vista crop is no exception.  However, since you're currently viewing the full version page, this obviously isn't an issue for you.  Just remember, the best ways to install Vista are either as a clean installation (if necessary obliterating an existing OS) or a dual boot scenario.  Anything else and you might experience problems.  But this has always been the case with in-place upgrades.-OVERALL-I thank you for reading this far.  Most people won't.  I know this was pretty long, but I wanted to get it all out there for people to read.  Vista is not a bad operating system.  Was I absolutely floored with it?  It may require some more time, but it hasn't been the revelation Microsoft promised.  This is somewhat disappointing, and yet, somewhat reassuring as well.  I didn't suffer any downtime because I couldn't figure out how the operating system works, I didn't have any glaring compatibility issues, and my computer has worked virtually error-free ever since I first installed the OS. In short, the change, while not mind blowing, wasn't drastic or disturbing, either.  At the end of the day, just remember: It's Windows.  Love it or leave it, it's just Microsoft's operating system.  Vista will do the same thing as XP and earlier editions; it's not a source of inspiration or drive.  It's only as good as the person who's using it.
I am a retired attorney who has experimented with earlier versions of the Dragon software over the last eight to 10 years.  I was never quite satisfied with the performance of the product.  However, I now own version 9 and have found it to be a very useful and accurate product.  If I were still practicing law, I would unquestionably utilize a program like this in my practice.  Because I did not like being tied to my computer by a microphone cable, I purchased a wireless microphone (by Nady - which I have also reviewed) which works even better than the wired headset that came with the program.  The program required less than one-half hour of setup although I have continued to train the program to meet the needs of my particular voice patterns.  This dictation is much more accurate than my typing, and I have found that correcting errors is a fairly simple process as well.  My only regret is that I purchased the basic program, rather than an advanced program.  Now that I see how well the product works, I wish that I had a more specialized vocabulary and the ability to dictate in more than just English as I am fluent in Spanish and have a growing acquaintance with French.  Incidentally, I dictated this review and use the dictation program regularly to respond to and send e-mails, as well as dictate letters, memoranda and outlines in Microsoft word.  It may be relevant to note that I am not using an underpowered computer system.  I have an AMD dual core system with 2 MB of RAM.  I am certain that there is a combination of good programming and growing computer power that makes a program such as this functional
Voice recognition software continues to improve.  I've been using versions of this software since 1998 and can see significant improvements in the voice recognition technology over that period.Before investing in this software, though, check carefully the specifications of your PC.  The faster the processor and the more RAM you have, the better the results.  The software will run on the minimum specification identified, but it may not run fast enough to satisfy the needs of some us.This software is useful in many circumstances.  Many of us can speak faster than we can type and many of us compose as we type.  The software can be used with a range of eMail clients as well as in word processing and other software.  You can, as it claims, obtain reasonable voice recognition results with a few minutes of set up and training.  But for optimal use, and the best return on investment, consider using the voice command capabilities to drive other software.  This takes more effort initially but can deliver significant benefits.I'll be buying a new PC before I look at upgrading this software.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smit
I have been aware of NaturallySpeaking for over 15 years.  We initially utilized this software to assist people with severe disabilities such as cerebral palsy to be able to have basic commands understood.  More recently five years ago I bought edition 4.0.  I found it to be frustrating when ever there was any background noise so I basically quit using it.  When I saw the 8.0 being advertised as the voice recognition software specifically for a small business atmosphere, I thought I would try it one more time.  Being a slow typist it has truly changed my life for the better.  Only 45 minutes were required to set up the speech-recognition files when the occasional mistakes occur during dictation if you correct those and change those right at that time, I never see that same misunderstanding happening again.  I have recommended it to two friends who are buying it.  It really does allow you to sit back in your chair relax, drink your coffee and dictate reports, answer e-mail or whenever it is you might need to do.  I can't think of any $70 expenditure that has given me so much back in such a short time.  I almost always have my headset on when I'm in front of the computer because anything that involves typing or entering data I used the DragonDictate to do
I only installed the product two days ago and have not really been able to give it a solid workout. That said, my initial take is very positive. As a writer and lousy typist, I think it will increase my productivity expotentially. I look forward to really getting into the nuts and bolts of the product very soon
I checked the reviews on many types of dictation software before selecting Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8 standard.  I recently had my wrist operated on and knew that I would be unable to write utilizing my hand for quite a while.  As an online student going to college I had to be able to participate in discussion boards and research papers daily.  This software was unbelievably easy to learn.  I followed the directions on setting it up so that the computer would recognize my voice.  I spent approximately 5 hours learning to program, and practicing before I was operated on.  I found that if I talked at my own natural speed the computer utilizing this software did an excellent job of deciphering my words.  I found the instructions very simple to follow.  Yes there were times that the computer displayed what I said incorrectly, but correcting it was extremely easy.I was able to keep up with my class throughout the six weeks I was in a cast.  My arm is still in a brace and I'm still using the software on a daily basis.  I'm actually using the software to write this review.  I highly recommend this software to anyone that needs to write research papers or that does a lot of computer typing on a daily basis.I am such a strong believer in the software that I know I will continue to use it even when my brace comes off.I found the software very compatible and easy to use even to answer my e-mails quickly and efficiently.This might be the perfect software to get for any college student.  To be able to look at research books and talk into the computer as you're looking up reference material is truly beneficial.  It was also very easy to stop Dragon software when you needed to to take a break think what you needed to write next.  All I needed to say was "go to sleep" and the microphone shuts off until you wake it out.To sum it all up the software was very easy to use and easy to set up.  I recommend it highly.Boca Raton Florid
In my experience really learning a language requires a mix of learning approaches. That means books, tapes, tutoring, and experience in a country that uses it. I have done all of these and feel this product is well worth including in the mix. I highly reccomend it. If you're serious you need to just pony up the money and use it.  
We ordered this program only two weeks before moving to Bogota, Columbia for a two year tour.  However, the Spanish Rosetta Stone taught was much higher level than the survival Spanish we needed when we arrived.  Overall we are learning the language and it is a GREAT program.  Wish we would have bought it 3 or 4 months before departing
It's a great product.  Especially for someone like me who works long hours and no chance of getting to take a language class formally, this is the way to go!  Thank you
I have used this software for about 4 weeks since posting my comment in reply to that review.  Having now had a chance to use the software, I can only say that I am almost 100% satisfied with it.  Some times, it's nice to have a spanish dictionary when after a few lessons, you still can't quite grasp the concept of the word you're being taught, but other than that...Yes, it is repetitious.  For those who want to learn another language, this is to be expected.  No, it's not a magic pill.However, in as little as three weeks I found myself largely able to understand what native speakers around me were talking about, even if my understanding of it was imperfect.Repetition (as they say) is key, but even if it were not, dedication is absolutely required.  You can only learn if you stick with the program, and even I have been rather lax about that much.  Still, I am wholly satisfied with my purchase.  It is clear to me that the program is only as good as its user though, and I really ought to be more dedicated to following it
If you are serious about learning Spanish this software isn't enough. You will need to purchase a Spanish-English dictionary - I like Barron's Spanish Dictionary because it came with a free down loadable software version - and a Spanish audio series such as Pimsleur or Learning Spanish Like Crazy (LSLC). A verb conjugation book is a good idea too, I like The big Red Book of 555 Spanish Verbs. Finally, just like back in the day, you should either buy flashcards or create your own to build up your vocabulary when you can't stand to look at the computer monitor even one second longer.Now here's the part of the puzzle that Rosetta Stone will help you with: it is very repetitive and requires interaction with picture/word association. I have found that this burns the words into my mind and that the photos help me to recall a word or phrase. Rosetta Stone will also help you with reading comprehension as well as spelling - as long as you use all the lesson plans and resist the temptation to just do the fun parts. But the speech recognition feature is not as good at teaching you to speak Spanish as a high quality audio series such as Pimsleur or LSLC. The advantage of the speech recognition is that you can slow down the word or phrase being spoken. So if you want to slow down the word "mujer" you can hear how the native speaker uses the hard H sound on the J and a slight roll on the last R; it's great for pronunciation but not effective for learning how to handle yourself in a conversation.In summary, Rosetta Stone is not a one stop shop. It isn't as mobile as an audio series on your iPod. And it isn't going to make learning Spanish a thoughtless and easy task. I recommend that you buy this software and use it but understand that you are paying $500 primarily for word/picture association and the ability to analyze your pronunciation of individual words and phrases. Also, keep your Spanish dictionary handy to alleviate any confusion. The whole childlike learning approach is good, but your adult skills will definitely help to speed up the process.
As the editor of the Learning Spanish Products Reviews (LearningSpanishProductsReviews) site, one of my responsibilities is to review learning-Spanish software products that are listed on Amazon. I am also a native Spanish speaker and a professional Spanish instructor. Rosetta Stone Spanish is a great Learning Spanish product for a child or pre-teenager that wants to learn Spanish. This software features native speakers, real-life images, and a speech recognition feature. Your child or pre-teenager will find that this software is lots of fun. But the photographs do appear to be from at least two decades ago. I'd actually give this product 5 stars as a tool for teaching a child or pre-teenager Spanish. But as a learning-Spanish product for an adult the effectiveness of the product really depends on whether the adult is a visual learner or not. My advice is for you to also experiment with some of the auditory or auditory/text based comprehensive Spanish courses sold on Amazon, and decide if you are primarily a visual or auditory (or auditory/text) learner. Even if you determine that you learn better with or an auditory Spanish course you can still get good results with Rosetta Stone Spanish, by using it to complement your main auditory home-study Spanish course. You may also find the Rosetta Stone software helpful if you're an adult that has one or more of the major comprehensive auditory courses under your belt, and now you are merely seeking to expand your vocabulary. 
I don't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it.  It is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did....and realize that you forgot to select "test" at the beginning.  Also, it seems that testing should be available for the 'guided exercise' also ...... not just the regular exercises.  Other than these two things, the program is very good
I recently purchased the anime studio 5 but not thepro version, which costs 150 more and gives more functionality.This is a fully functioning animation software, with lots of interesting features. I can see no reason that a noviceanimator such as I am would not be happy with this software.I would like to see more energy put into a manual, but you can scavenge the anime blog/chat site to find answers, orgoogle other places.  With a more robust manual, this wouldbe 5 stars, not 4.  It is really the reason I am reluctantto upgrade to Pro, because I would want more lessons andtutorials to go along with the upgrade. If you have an interest in animating, this is the software for you. 
Anime Studio 5 is surprisingly powerful. Fairly easy to get started with and appears to have a lot of power waiting to be exploited.
Turbo Tax Deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item.Also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return. It's very annoying to find and adjust the State Return once you have gone back into your Federal Return.I think it is a very good product BUT they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas ESPECIALLY for the STATE RETURN
This product did an excellent job of figuring our taxes.  This is the first time we've tried something like this and found it very easy to follow and complete.  You can go back and change things or review them, it gives you a way to e-file, you can print out all the copies that you may need.  I was surprised how easy it was to use.  However it took us a long time because we read all the items very carefully and double checked everything but it saved us a lot of money from what we used to pay our tax preparer.  I was very happy with it
My only reccomendation would be a better user interface, it can be a bit confusing. The underlying functions work well though
My legal ofice bought this product specifically for making unfillable PDF forms fillable.  This feature works much better than we expected.  I anticipated we would have to do a lot of clean-up to make the forms useable.  That is not the case.  About 80% of the forms we run through it come out perfectly.  It seems to have trouble with forms that are really crowded with fields or have embedded fonts that we don't have access to.  Designing fillable forms from scratch used to take us hours for a simple form.  I could see most of the forms we use taking 6-8 hours each.  Running it through the FormTyper takes a few seconds.  The amount of time we save on this one task is tremendous.  We have also begin using the OCR capabilites to create digitial documents from our paper files.  The OCR seems to work really well, even with multi-generation copies.  We are very pleased with the performance of this product.
This software came with a scanner I recently purchased and I decided to upgrade from the "SE"(striped edition?)that was bundled with the device. Considering the cost and what the software can do it is an amazing value. By simply using this software to re-create documents instead of retyping them is saving me more an hour or two a day. I was hesitant to puchse it based upon all the recent negative reviews, but decided with the 30 day refund policy I could try it risk free. I'm glad I did. The software worked flawlessly for me - even on 5th and 6th generation copies that were hard to read with my naked eye (and I don't need or wear glasses). I'm not sure what those people that were scanning books were trying to accomplish, but when I scanned some pages from an encyclopedia for my son the OCR worked great!  Try it and if it doesn't work then return it.
I have been using OmniPage for several years at my law office and found that the OCR with this version is impeccable.  I frequently scan and OCR newspaper and magazine articles.  They are multi-column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts.  When i convert them into Word documents I seldom get any formating errors.  In fact, because the OCR is so good I have set up a batch process to run at night to OCR all the day's work so my computer resoiurces aren't being taxed when I am in the office working.  Way to go Nuance
The very early years of optical character recognition (OCR) were quite the challenge.  Programs cost thousands of dollars, as did the scanners.  None of them worked very well.  It would take longer to "clean up" the document after scanning than it would for the secretary to have typed it in from scratch.  All of that has of course now changed, and Omnipage 15 Pro takes the art and craft to a new level.I have been using the Omnipage product for the last seven years or so.  I use it my law office (along with a number of the other Scansoft, now Nuance, suite of products) on a daily basis, many times through out the day. We use it to chew up everything from court pleadings, to 100 page plus contracts, to real estate property descriptions, which must be accurate down to the comma and semicolon.  Our needs are fairly simple - get the text into the word processor so we can respond on behalf of our client as fast as possible. OP15Pro offers a significant performance increase over its predecessor version 14.  It is faster (very much faster) and more accurate.  Work flow is straight forward.  There is of course the ability to manually set or readjust recognition zones, recognize and format as spreadsheets.  This new version easily handles text in relation to graphic elements and does a good job of keeping them all together in their right places.  Like most everything else, and especially with computers and software, nothing is perfect and there are times that OP15 misses a mark.  It is however, for the most part, very accurate and efficient, but remember, the old rule of "garbage in equals garbage out" still applies.  We have recently started taking pen scanner images of documents in the books at the local registries of deeds.  These are 200 dpi scans of documents that themselves are old photocopies of text placed on paper with IBM Selectrics or worse.  In other words, stuff from the dark ages of the 1970's and before.  We were pleasantly surprised at how well OP15Pro performed. With these very old images there is a need to clean them up, but nowhere near what it used to be.I will comment only briefly about the company's tech support.  There has always been enough information provided to get the software up and running. The key, of course, is to read and follow the directions.  A task that is sometimes difficult in this "I want it now world." The one "free call" is not just for installation problems, but can come months or even years after the product is purchased.  I have also found on occasion that tech support will often answer the simple and obvious questions without first asking for the credit card.  Solving technical problems can be frustrating and time consuming.  Considering what the software is attempting to do, there fact that it accomplishes it at all seems at times to be just short of a miracle. Lastly, the company's knowledge base is filled problem solving information.  There is also a tremendously large user base that supports the product through Usenet and other forums.Norm Michaels, Esq
We have used ScanSoft/Nuance products for over five years - As a matter of fact I am writing this review using Dragon 8. OmniPage Pro 15 along with the PDF converter is by far the best on the market. The technical support has been fantastic throughout the years and the engineers always had open ears for recommended changes. OmniPage Pro 15 has saved me thousands of dollars because of its unbelievable OCR accuracy.  With a click and a choice I can now convert a PDF document into XL as spreadsheet.  Before this technology was created it was such a hassle. When I have to fill out a form OmniPage Pro 15 uses the saved information to help me. The program can run in the background and does not freeze or slow down my system.Edward Lampl President of Healthcare RecruitmentStuart Search Group
I only have the basic and its good but i've seen this and it has to be the #@*ing koolest thing you can have right now. I highly recommened it for begginers to experts
If you're looking to create the next Doom 3 or Half-Life 2, then I can't really recommend this program. If you want to make an advanced FPS game, or a simple pong game, then I can recommend Dark Basic. In fact, Dark Basic Professional is probably capable of creating any kind of game that you can come up with. The catch? You have to program it yourself, all from scratch. Dark Basic makes manipulating 3D data extremely easy, but it's not a game creation package which lets you click and create. If you are determined enough, it's easy to learn all of Dark Basic's commands, as half of programming a game is in the logic. Dark Basic will hardly limit you, and will give you capabilities that were probably impossibly hard for you to use in C++. The end result of creating a game from scratch results in a tremendous sense of satisfaction, especially when you share it with friends and family. Although previous versions of Dark Basic Professional had some hardly crippling bugs, most of them have been eliminated, and with the release of upgrade 6.0, DBPro is a very stable development engine. Overall, I totally recommend this to anyone who wants to create a game, but is determined enough to learn how
I give the DB Pro 5 stars, but I am totally disappointed in Amazon.com and The Gamecreaters, heres whyThe first thing I noticed is my box is different than that shown here... http://darkbasicpro.thegamecreators.comI didnt recieve any of the free software stated in the link aboveI cant find the Over 45 Demo'sOver 25 TutorialsOver 600 TexturesOver 120 Sound Effects900 3D Models That is stated here...http://darkbasic.thegamecreators.com/I applied the .59 upgrade patch and now my program wont start. It says its missing MSVCR71.dll file.The original version was 1.05I cant believe the darkbasic.com is advertising this product, yet Amazon.com is shipping some ancient version. Hopefully I will be able to resolve this issue..
Was using DataManager, but disliked the constant disk access in background.  Acronis backs up well without constant background disk access, and uses less disk space
Purchased this software to transfer files and operating system from on old laptop hard drive to a new one.  I put the new drive in a USB external case attached it to the laptop and ran the software.  In about 20 minutes and 3 mouse clicks the operation was completed and worked perfectly.  I have also used the software to image my hard drive as a backup.  The menus are easy to use making all available tasks straight forward
The product does just what I want it to do.  I needed a backup system that was reliable and simple to use.  I ordered a harddrive with it and the combination of the two works just fine.  B
Acronis True Image 10.0 Home is really great for making backups and moving entire partitions to a new disk.  Very easy, foolproof, and dependable. Good product.. good price
Poser user since Version 3.Poser continues to improve.More life-like, faster
You will probably read 50/50 from the reviews on this software.  Having used the older Poser software... One thing I am a fan of is Miki and Terai Yuki...Japanese virtual beauties and if you are a fan of Japanese styled video games and the character designs, the fact that e-frontier is now the company behind Poser 6, I'm so stoked.Granted, the software with bundles (best to buy it bundled with other cool software), there is a free software out called Daz3D.  Daz3D content creators make stuff for Daz3D and Poser and vice versa but no matter if you go with the free program or Poser 6, the result will be the same...expect to pay money for content.I highly recommend getting the book "Pratical Poser 6" because it's very, very informative unlike the manual. Next thing...before you buy...mosey down to daz3d.com, contentparadise.com, renderosity.com and ask yourself, can you afford to buy the content.  Content costs anywhere from free to over $100+.  And the good stuff costs money...maybe not a lot but it does add up.  The next thing to know is that after you buy the content, due to how the hair or clothing conforms to the body (or how it's placed), they are not organized.  To make matters worse is that the names that the creators have called their work are long that the window for the selections (Figure, Pose, Hair, Prop, etc.) can get cut off and so, it becomes a bit of a choir to go back and forth to certain folders.But I got used to it and the thing is ....all developers for the content are helpful.  Content Paradise is a great place to buy your content as well as from the creators websites as well.There is a lot of trial and error and I wish there were more undos...because really, although there is an undo...you mess up...you can't just undo...you have to start over your from your save file (and hopefully you saved).  Nevertheless, the stuff I was able to create in Poser is wonderful.  I will say that I have spent a lot not just on the Poser and the bundle but the content.  It adds up quickly!!!  So, consider the benefits for you.  Although I love the characters from Daz3D and the ever popular Foxhair,  I'm more a fan for Poser but still expect to be buying content from Dax3D for use of poser. 
**things i liked about the programit supports importing ojb files, that i make in different modeling programsthe walking path editor works not too bad for simulated walkingand the rigs have good looking emontions when you moves there face features**what i found to be not so goodthe tabs such as the library and keyframe bar are kind of hidden on the side because of his small they are.  I find the slection tool in the hair room to be alittle bit annoying when trying to grow dynamic hair groups. i most of the time end up growing hair on too many facets.  the control points are too senative, they end up twisting the body in un-natrual forms. the rendering takes a very long, and the rendering shader doesent always save my settings. i end up transporting the animation to another program to render faster. some of the cloths i cant set them up to be childern to the body parts so they end up not being connected to anything. i'm sure there more on my mind by i dont have much time to write up an review. just keep in mind 3d animation isnt perfectly easy. a good modeling programs to make OBJ files will go a long way. 
The software was just what I expected and very useful to me when creating publisher documents that need to be emailed to clients. 
The program is over what I expected. Performance is great and such a useful tool
Many more fonts to choose from -- an excellent value
I like the way the program goes through the tax forms as if you are interviewing with a tax preparer. However, I think it needs to do a better job of explaining why a tax form cannot be emailed and how to address that issue
I started off using Turbotax this year, but returned it to the store to use Taxcut instead. I purchased this version because it was a bargain, and it's easy enough to do state taxes by hand (or for free on the state website for those states that have that option).I did have some difficulty with the update process, which was frustrating at first. However, I found Taxcut's website to be helpful on this point, and I determined that my firewall was the problem. I was able to update the product once I followed their instructions.One key difference between Turbotax and Taxcut was that Taxcut is not integrated with as many companies. Whereas I could automatically download my W-2 and most of my 1099 forms into Turbotax, they needed to be manually entered with Taxcut. This wasn't a huge issue, but one difference people might want to know.I completed and e-filed multiple federal returns, which worked great, and the e-file charge was reasonable ($15.95). However, I don't suggest having the e-file charge taken out of your refund. Apparently, there's an extra charge (I think $25) for this service. It's more efficient and less expensive to just pay the fee with a credit card.Now to the software itself. I found it easy to navigate and enter information. I was a bit disappointed in the deduction section. Many of the fields were too short for me to enter complete names and addresses of charities, which I found frustrating. However, the calculations were accurate. I checked Taxcut's calculations regarding AMT, and they were excellent (Turbotax's calculations were wrong). In the second return I completed, the taxpayer was eligible for EIC, and Taxcut accurately identified this and did the proper calculations here as well.Overall, I was very satisfied with the product, and will use it again next year. I will make suggestions to Taxcut, and hope they will improve their support for automatic download of forms and longer fields for charitable deductions. However, even without these changes, the product is an exceptional value
Purchased this edition of TaxCut last week.  On WIN XP2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues.  I imported last year's data in less than a minute and I had my return completed in less than 1 hour.  This includes capital gains/losses, dividends, and AMT calculations.  It doesn't get much easier than this.Yes, you have to download updates.  The IRS is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores.  The alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it, but wouldn't that take at least as long
my son is absolutely loves this dvd/games.  I have to turn off the main switch to the computer in order to keep him off of it and play with his sister. he learned so much since I got this learning system and I am totally extati
my sister have been uesing it since i bought it for her and i think she like it 
It is a little bit clumsey. When I go to it, instead of my cursor being in the space where I write the word for a definition, I have to place it there and that takes time. The first one of these electronic dictionaries I had (about 5 years ago) was fabulous, it was called "deluxe" and had everything, but my computer outgrew ot amd the makers have never bothered to bring it up to date and offer it again.
This software is very user friendly,easy to install, easy to use.  I would recommend it to anyone
It is wondeful software.  Simple, easy to use, user-friendly, and very accurate in the pronunciation.Buy this CD.  Don't waste your money on the subscription at merriam-webster's website.ALso try the Medical dictionary.  It is as equally superb
Compared to FP 2000 and earlier versions, it offered some major improvements, even letting one code in (gasp) PHP with live preview - it is highly configurable, and easily tied into SharePoint (well, I think that was the intent).  It was quite an evolution, moving beyond FP2000, with some fairly advanced features - while still retaining the "entry level, small business learnable" functionality (albeit cookie cutter designs) of previous versions.  I was surprised to find it even offered options to strip out all code that hinted this site was made with FrontPage (an odd change, knowing MS), but also offered other code functions, some on par with Dreamweaver - but do not mistake this for Dreamweaver, even the first MX version.  It's still aimed at Microsoft only - you really have to dig and tweak to configure it for anything else (e.g, php, cold fusion) - but it does offer some major improvements for flexibility over previous versions.  Mostly good, some horribly bad.The good - being able to tweak it to dozens of standards' compliance, Sec. 508, XML'ish stuff, whatever.  By default these things are not set up, so it does take some learning.  What annoyed (and freaked me out) was that while it easily allowed for desktop development with Access, to create database driven sites - the database had to remain in a public folder - ok, I suppose if you're using it only on an intranet.  I believe the point was to code with Access, then mod it slightly to interact with SQL server - but most folks probaby did not use it that way - knowing the history and "fire and forget" ease of use of FrontPage... Anyhow, I'd call this a para-professional version. It has way more flexibility and functionality than any version of Frontpage, ever.  It is also going bye-bye.  There will not be a FrontPage 2007, due to the switch to Expression Web (which retains some FP functionality, but the "friendly" and pesky "bots" are gone).  No more email bots, whatever bots - gotta learn how to roll your own.
I purchased this software mainly for Web Design.  I am beginning in Web Design and found Microsoft Frontpage 200 easy to learn with a lotof interesting features to design a web site.  I would definitely recommend this product
Frontpage 2003 is a great, easy-to-use WYSIWYG web builder.  Most hosting companies support Frontpage extensions, a set of web robots to help you build a dynamic site, similar to DHTML.Two warnings, though:1) This full version is too expensive; you may qualify to buy the half-priced Academic Version (search for "frontpage 2003 academic" on Amazon);2) More important, though, Frontpage is being discontinued as a product altogether and will be replaced by Office SharePoint Designer (for businesses) and Expression Web (for everyone else).  You can download the latter for free (for now, at least) on MSFT's website
Given my limited knowledge of computer science and programming i felt FrontPage was a a really big help. I was able to get a website up and running in about 2 weeks which i think is pretty good all things considering. I didn't realize though that Frontpage isn't the cureall for making a website really. Primarily only for WEB DESIGN i.e. if you want to make a website with E-commerce and query searches of an inventory database and the like, you're gonna need to bring in the professional programmers in any event to program in ASP or PHP. But as far as Web Design goes Frontpage can take a novice a long way. 
It was some years ago when I bought a previous CD version of this Encyclopedia. Although technology has advanced, and Wikipedia has come into existence, Encyclopedia Britannica is more reliable.
The hard-copy of Britannica has been the standard in reference for centuries, now you can have all of that, with video, audio, tons of photos, and extra support from the web for a fraction of the price of the original.  For what you get, it's an incredible deal and an indispensable part of any reference library
I trust the information I find from Britannica and so invested in the 2007 Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.It has something for everyone.I use it side by side with Microsoft Encarta and together I get a more complete subject review.I prefer the content of Britannica but for ease of use Encarta is still superior.I look forward to Britannica making the interface and ease of use better in future productions and that is why I am only able to award 4 stars
If you want a simple to use program to manage personal finances Quicken is for you. I have found it very useful for keeping track of my checking and savings accounts. You can also make automatic posts to your accounts. Which is nice feature if you use automatic online bill pay with your bank. The program makes charts, graphs and reports showing where your money is going and coming from. It also does a nice job showing you if where you are meeting your budget and where you are spending too much money. Quicken makes keeps track of loans easy. It calculates how much money is going to interest and principle. I have been having a hard time and have been unsuccessful at setting up the program to track my 403B account. Overall, I think Quicken is a good program and recommend it to anyone to anyone who does not have a similar product already
I have used Quicken for over 12 years.  Whenever I got a new version, it always worked for me.  But, it has too many things on it that I don't need. I like to keep it more simple for me, so I just use the register, reconcile, reports, and lists-catagories. For all I use it for, I am happy with it
This monster is great...my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already, and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit. We heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor...luckily she hadn't gone to her attorney's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all...thanks toilet monster..you were worth the $15 + $5 shipping we paid for you
On the basis of the first review here, I ordered this bike and couldn't be happier with it.  This is the first piece of exercise equipment I've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up. I use it every day
The gripmaster has helped me strengthen my left fingers which is so important in the use of my reins when riding.  I took it with me on vacation to Florida, and two of my friends--one older who wanted to use it for arthritic hands and the other just for stiff joints--saw it, started using it and loved it.  So I ordered two more!
My son is 5 years old and absolutly loves this digger.It was easy to put togther and is very durable.I would highly recommend it. He also likes that it has tracks so he can sit on it and move it where he wants
I bought this ball as an alternative to a regular office chair. I am able to work on my abdominal muscles while surfing the web, or other computer work. It helps me to stay focused on the work and not get frustrated with not being able to move around. It is exactly what I was looking for
This machine really makes you feel it. I like the fact that it also stretches your back which feels great. The only thing I can say is I wish it folded up for better storage but other than that, I like it.
Make sure you do other forms of exercise and good diet habits to compliment this. I like using it when I'm at home and don't feel like going to the gym. I cardio, (running or something) afterwards. It's really effective if your form is correct.
This is a great exercise ball.  It is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines.  Let me tell you!!!  It is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and I can really feel my muscles working out .  It helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility.  this is a great  product!!!!!!!!
The last ball I had requirted the bicycle pump to fill it. I'm just too lazy to run out and find the bike pump every time I need a little more air. The pump that comes with this ball doubles for filling other things too. At my kids birthday party I used it to fill some inflatable decorations and I've used it to fill an air mattress. So two things: the ball is easily inflated and the pump is handy
Great product. I just received my ball today. I couldn't wait to work out. If I learn how to stay on it that would be saying something! I will always recommend Max-Fitness
I recently decided to try and teach myself guitar after having stopped for a while.  One of the suggestions i got was to get a Gripmaster, and when i checked it out, I found this gizmo could actually help in more ways than just strengthening my fingers. I ordered one, and I can definitely say it was a good investment! There's a big difference in my grip now - I can even crack a nut with one hand easily (using a nutcracker of course). I can't wait to try the 7-lb one
Let me start saying that this is a wonderful product. Small, light, and well constructed (they feel like they will last forever). You can carry them with you, allowing to workout your fingers at the office, at home or wherever you find suitable. I bought the four different color-coded gripmasters: Black/heavy, Red/medium, Blue/light, and Yellow/extra light. I only found the resistance of the red and black ones useful for me, but my wife loves the blue and yellow ones. It was a great buy because of their high quality and affordable price. The product comes with a foldable instruction booklet where you find details for six different exercises: - Trigger pinch. This one simulates the movement of squeezing a trigger, and it isolates the index finger for enhanced strength and coordination. - Gross grasp. This one strengthens fingers, thumb, wrist and forearm for a firm grip. - Hook position. This one strengthens longer muscles in forearm and wrist while stretching smaller muscles in hand for greater motion and endurance. - Tip to tip pinch. This exercise strengthens specific fingers, thumb, smaller hand muscles and forearm for greater control and endurance. - Wrist flexion. It strengthens wrist and forearm muscles. - Key pinch. Strengthens thumb and index finger for greater stability and coordination. At the gripmaster website you can find more exercises for different activities and sports. If you are looking to crush hands when handshaking this is not the product for you, but if you need finger strength, control, endurance and coordination you are in the right place
I originally bought the Blue (5 lb), Red (7 lb) and the Black (9 lb) Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys. The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger. The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it. It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light, this makes it good for use anytime, anywhere. (I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever) If I had to do it again, I would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip, probably have started with the Red. Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping, the challenge is working out the fingers. It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers. It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts. Great product, excellent for finger or hand exercise, good quality
I love my treadmill!  My son put it together for me and he had no trouble.  I love all the options on this treadmill.  I use only the basic so far, but I can see the benefit in having the pre-programmed workouts.  I can't wait to get there to try it! It's hard to say enough about this machine.  It's a great MACHINE
I received this from my husband as a birthday present. It figures he was going to get something with the name 'IronMan'. =P I've only used it for a week, but I think we're going to have a long and happy relationship. (Tho' I've found my husband using it more then I am!) Its easy to fold up, which is important as I'm not the strongest woman in the world. But I leave it out as I know that if it's folded and put away I probably won't use it. However, this sucker looks so cool that I really have no desire to put it in the closet. Everything on it is convinent, with one exception. They made the display easy to see, but it blocks the TV! LOL. One star off for that... =
I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer, and I have never encountered a single problem. I usually use the interface in to different computers, a notebook at home (with XP), and a desktop at work (2000), and in both computers it works nicely.You have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the IR interface. Install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer. I love my Polar watch, and the IR interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product.
Initially I had some trouble figuring out the right port to use. But now it works and I've used it constantly for at least 2 years
First off you can find this price lots of places.  It is probably the minimum sale price allowed by schwinn.  I choose to buy mine through AMAZON becasue I got 3% back with my visa, free delivery, and didn't pay sales tax.  That made up for most of the cost difference between the 212 and the 213.  I wanted the extra programs.Delivery was smooth except they had to come back once for me to sign for the delivery.  No problems with the packaging in our case.  Assembly took about an hour and a half.  It was pretty simple and the tools you need were included which was nice.  Overall this assembly was much easier than most things I have put together.The bike is stable, quiet and smooth.  Easy to ride and easy to adjust between the big guy and the little woman.  Overall we are very pleased and look forward to years of use.  I didn't rate this a 5 cause we've only had ours a week
I did read all the reviews and was afraid something bad could happen during delivery. My fears proved wrong. I received a heavy package not damage, with all contents inside. The bike is working well and it is really a great exercise bike
My physician told me to exercise or else, so I looked at Comsumer Reports and listened to friends who spoke of a recumbent bike. Amazon's  price was great and I have been delighted. If you like to read and exercise, this one's for you
Wow, it's not often a person gets excited about exercise equipment, but my Schwinn 213 Recumbent bike arrived today.  I have read several reviews about the condition of the box when it arrives.  My bike arrived in a timely manner.  The box had taken a minimal amount of abuse and was mostly intact.  Nothing inside was broken, scratched or bent.  The instructions were crystal clear.  It only took me about 30 minutes to have it up and running.  The hardware comes vacuum sealed onto a piece of cardboard and clearly labeled.  The hardware for step 1 is labeled step 1, etc.  I have never assembled anything with the ease in which this went together.  It is a solidly built piece of equipment.  I only tried it out for a few minutes, but it is quiet, pedals smoothly, and has a ton of features.Ok, now for the things I don't like, the list is small but worth noting.  The fan and digital display is not angled enough for you to get any benefit from the fan, nor can you read the display.  Only if you are very short and have to sit close to the screen can you read it with ease.  I am 5'10" and the fan does not adjust to blow on me.  I can just barely read the display from where I have to sit.  A book holder would have been nice.  That is it.  The things I like far outweigh the things I don't.  It comes with 10 pre-programmed routines, manual mode, timed trials, etc.  You can even input how many calories you want to burn and it will count down the calories instead of minutes.  I haven't used all the features, but so far I am thrilled to death with my purchase and despite some of the negative things about it, I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable way to exercise.10-15-06Ok, I've had this for a week now and I want to shout from the rooftops how comfortable and great it is.  I solved my problem of not being able to read the screen very well but taking a crow-bar and GENTLY prying up on the top edge of the metal plate that the read-out screen is attached to. Take the electronic screen off before doing this.  The plate bent up just enough that now I can read the screen just fine.  I still don't get much benefit from the fan, but the fan doesn't really blow hard enough anyway.  I have tried out the easiest program and it is amazing.  I can't begin to say enough about this bike.  If you truly hate exercising, this is the bike for you.  Schwinn has taken an activity some of us dread and has transformed it into something I don't mind doing.  I am using this bike along with the Weider Crossbow, another piece of equipment I can't rave enough about, as my total body workout.  I hope to be slimmer, trimmer and stronger 6-8 weeks from now.  Also, I want to mention again how quiet this bike is while operating.  When I used a treadmill, I had to either blast the television if I wanted to hear it, or use headphones, which were uncomfortable once I started sweating.  This bike is so quiet you can have the television or stereo at a normal volume.  If you are interested in an exercise bike that is comfortable and versatile, this is the bike for you
I love these workouts. They are very intense, and the results are almost immediate;however this series is not for beginners. The best part of these workouts is your left feeling it for at least a day.      My only complaints with this series were the lack of attention Billy paid to the lower half of the body and the bands are sometimes cumbersome to use with certain moves.     All in all this was a great purchase for me. I will probably purchase the new Bootcamp elite series
  I write a lot of reviews on books,but seldom write one on a product.However; I feel like breaking my trend by reviewing this lite.I,like I suppose,just about everyone else,keep looking for the lite that is right for all people,for all purposes.If It exists,I haven't seen it yet.The plain ordinary battery flashlight has remained essentially the same since I got my first as a kid,60 years ago. They often fail you when they are needed,batteries are expensive,but overall they serve a purpose. About 50 years ago ,a hand held magneto lite appeared.As long as you kept squeezing it,it gave a light comparable to a normal flashlght.It was similar to a lite sold for use on a bicycle,where it was powered by the turning of the wheel.However; as soon as the bicycle stopped ,the light went out.For some reason,they disappeared off the market.A few years ago,a new almost similar magneto lite appeared.The biggest difference is, it made a lot of noise when squeezed.They don't appear to have been very popular. This Faraday principle Lite has been made very popular due to TV ads, More because what they don't say than what they do say,many people are disappointed upon getting one.  The ad flouts the idea that it can be seen for up to a mile.Sowhat!,we learned in the military, that a lit cigarette can be seen hundreds of yards away at night.So,if that's not you were looking for,it is meaningless to you.In fact,it is very poor at casting light on a suface more than a few feet away.For this purpose ,it can't begin to compete with a normal flashlight;and if that's what you want,forget it.As a matter of fact,those little LED keychain lites can do just as much;and can be picked up for a buck at the "Dollar Stores". They last for a couple of years,weigh next to nothing,and you'll always have one with you.I Leave them around the house  and they are handy to look for something in a dark spot,or for the occasional time you need to find a circuit breaker panel or find your way in a power failure.   These lites are so weak you can't assume they will meet your expectations in a store,or from watching a TV ad.My advice is try and compare with a Key Chain lite,one might serve you as well as the other,at a huge difference in cost. 
We just got it, I first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine, and I let it sit for a day and a half.  It lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time. Shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long. We are in the Caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight. This works perfectly.
Fantastic product--I am a group fitness instructor and I use this product everyday--I add a banana, peanut or cashew butter, plain yogurt, ice and water--this is in lieu of dinner--I don't get hungry and it really keeps my energy levels up
This was a gamble since it isn't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign.  I only tried Muscle Milk because I read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an NFL athelete during an ESPN interview. I started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily. Two months later my strength has increased, my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished. My workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on MM but the results since using MM have made an impact, there is nothing else I can attribute it to. The fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of MM I would still use it if it tastes like battery acid. Do not fool yourself, it is loaded with fat. It relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it's true benefit. You will not get sculpted by using MM without commitment, you will only get fatter. But if you are committed and use MM as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance. 
Safety key was fine...except I purchased treadmill without book and it was not the size I was looking for. I took a chance at the size so my own fault
The item was very easy to assemble and it works well and certainly seems to do what it says. It is great
I don't actually own one yet, but my boyfriend does so I've been sneaking over to his house to use it until I make room in my own home for one.  When I first used it I was like some of the other reveiwers, disappointed that it didn't work my abs the way I expected, but then I realized I wasn't doing it correctly.  It makes it pretty easy to use your legs and arms instead of just your abs so it helps to focus at the beginning on just using your abs and nothing else and then you can really feel it! The strap is way too small though, I usually just put my fingers under it, but there's no way to do somme things that the lady on the video does, like sticking your arms through the strap and holding them straight...and I have pretty small arms.  The range of motion thing is great, and feels so good on the back, which is the complete opposite of doing crunches on the ground(I used to do about 1,000 crunches a day but then I started getting bruises on my back from them and I pretty much hit a plateau where I wasn't seeing any changes in my abs).  I have so much fun using the ab lounge while I watch TV too, it's a great way to make the commercial time go by.I would recommend that the people having problems with this try to go slowly and really focus on working just your abs, it makes it so much more worth it
I bought this mat for my exercise bike.  It was large and gave my floor great protection.  I would recommend this mat to anyone that has exercise equipment
So many children and even adults bounce on my ball whenever they come over and happen to see it!  That's not what it's supposed to be used for but it just shows how sturdy it is.  My friend who is probably about 250 lbs didn't even pop it
The backpack is great.  It is a wonderful tool for dogs with lots of energy.  You can fill it with lots of weight and they love carrying it.  It secures well, and dogs love it.  If you give a dog a job, they really feel useful, and I think they appreciate it a lot
I've had one of these for 13 years.  ONE.  For THIRTEEN years.  It still works great.PLEASE use it carefully, if you're going to use it.  You can very easily give yourself a very nasty case of some obscure (or not) repetitive stress syndrome.  To completely avoid that, and any similar problems you'll need Dr. Sonnon... but in the meantime, just be careful
Two years ago, I tore one of the transverse ligaments in my wrist playing racquetball, which was the unfortunate combination of a dusty court, 200 pounds of player moving about 15 miles an hour, a poorly timed forehand and very hard wall.I had two surgeries to repair the injury, and it was mostly successful.  The biggest side effect has been weakness in my injured wrist and hand.  I have moved beyond squeezing toys and putty, but I lacked the strength to do weight training.This device has been a tremendous breakthrough for me.  I have been able to make some rapid gains in my strength without risking injury with weights.  I am already seeing the difference in just two weeks.If you are recovering from surgery such as carpal tunnel or other wrist related injuries, I strongly recommend making this device part of your recovery plan.  Of course, check with your doctor and/or physical therapist before starting up a new exercise
This is the first product I've ever bought to work out my forearm, so I can't compare it to anything else...but I will say it does work.  I've noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it.  It's comfortable and easy to use.  I would like the highest resistance to be a little harder, though
I used to try to strengthen my fingers using the Gripp balls, and later, the  Gravity Gripp, which were grip balls that were also 1 pound weights.  However, they were bulky, hard to get a grip on, and heavy and pretty silly looking.  So, when I saw the picture of these awesome little gizmos in a catalog, I ordered one right away.  They are about the same price of the Grip balls, but they are SO much cooler!  Not only is this good for  fitness training, they're even better for musicians!  (my instrument is piano.)  These are light and flat and they fit right into a purse.    I don't feel silly using this out in public -- if anyone asks, I just let them try it, and they are immediately hooked.  I carried my blue one around everywhere until this weekend, when I gave it away to a friend.  It is difficult to know which tension to use.  I'm a woman with small hands, and found that I am right between the blue and the red.  I use the blue one for 4th and 5th finger (left hand).  I can usually handle the red one for everything else, but the booklet says that repititions are more effective than heavier tension.  I use mainly the blue one now.  I hope to work up to the red, but that will be a while.  I'm also going to buy a couple more so I can work both hands simultaneously.  I do have one caveat -- make sure you use these correctly. Don't overdo it, or try to use a heavier tension to just to feel all macho.  Like any weight training, you have to press the buttons precisely to isolate the muscles.  Don't use your whole arm just to get the button pressed.  I found that if I started to cheat, I got a little wrist pain and felt the beginnings of tendonitis.  (another reason I'm staying on the blue tension for now.)Oh, and buy your Gripmaster here at Amazon.  They are $15 each everywhere else
I originally bought the Blue (5 lb), Red (7 lb) and the Black (9 lb) Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys. The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger. The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it. It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light, this makes it good for use anytime, anywhere. (I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever) If I had to do it again, I would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip, probably have started with the Red. Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping, the challenge is working out the fingers. It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers. It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts. Great product, excellent for finger or hand exercise, good quality
Yes.........I like it, after using for 2 weeks, my fingers were strong. Good thing is that this exercise helps in smooth blood flowing in your body
I went to a lot of stores trying out many differnt treads and researching what I should get. I need a good unit that's going to last. This one was one of the models I kept seeing and hearing good things about. I loved it in the stores, but Amazon had a better price, and I didn't mind waiting a week to get it. I've been using it now for about 3 weeks, and I can see why I kept hearing good things about it. It's really sturdy, and there was a lot of attention put on the little details. Everythings right where it should be, it's very quiet, and very sturdy. I'd reccomend it if you want something your going to use every day.
On the basis of the first review here, I ordered this bike and couldn't be happier with it.  This is the first piece of exercise equipment I've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up. I use it every day
I recently purchased a pair of the Gripmaster Hand  Finger Exercisers in order to help build forearm strength.  As I was unsure which tension would be appropriate, I bought one each of the Light/Blue (5 lbs. tension) and Medium/Red (7 lbs. tension) grips.  I've had them for a little more than a week now, and I just love, love, love them!  Perhaps that's a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories, but I really do enjoy the grips.  I leave one out on my desk at all times, and get in a little work here and there when I stop to read a document or whatnot.  The Gripmaster Exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once, or each finger individually (great for guitar players, I've heard!).  One side features four small levers, each with its own spring, that can be squeezed together or one at a time.  The plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit.  The black rubber cushion is removable, and you can place it on either side of the grip.  It's an awesome idea, and allows for maximum versatility!  Just for reference, I'm a female, in relatively good shape, but with painfully little forearm strength (my biceps are huge from years of Tae Bo, though!).  The 7 lb. Medium/Red grip is do-able, but challenging.  The 5 lb. Light/Blue grip, on the other hand, makes for a much easier workout; I oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things, and I only feel it after a number of reps.  If you're a female and not in great shape, you'll want to start out with the Light/Blue grips (or even the Extra Light/Yellow ones), and work your way up.  Out-of-shape guys can probably get away with the Medium/Red ones to start.  If you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength, don't even both with the lighter tensions - skip ahead to the Medium/Red or Heavy/Black.   Although I've only owned my Gripmasters for a week or two, and can't personally vouch for their durability, they do seem sturdy and well-crafted.  My fianc's brother, an amateur boxer and guitar player, used his for years without a problem, so I have faith that I'll be squeezing these babies well into 2015!- Kelly Garbato, Couch Potato Turned Fitness Fanati
This tools is really really great. It helped me to overcome the problem I faced while playing guitar, specially the barre chords
I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer, and I have never encountered a single problem.

Bought this bike for my wife. It arrived a day late for the next day delivery. The packaging was a little crumpled but the contents were ok. The directions for assembly couldn't have been more clear and easy to understand. It took me about an hour, taking my time to put it together. The bike seems solid and sturdy enough to last a long time. Also very comfortable
My box arrived somewhat banged up, but apart from a cosmetic scuff on one handlebar, it was OK. BUT, after 2 days I started hearing a noise, seemed to come from the interior of the pedals/gearbox, sounded like a loose object bouncing around. I was afraid I would have to ship it back. I called Schwinn, and the woman asked me to take the pedals off and see if I could reproduce the sound. I assured her, it was not the pedals. She said, "yes sir, now please take the pedals off".  I did, and, it was the left pedal! Sounded just like the interior. Anyway, they will send me new pedals, so problem solved. Sounds like they have encountered this problem before.Also, I was frustrated by the inability to see the blue display screen, so I bought 2 doorstops, removed the standard mounting screws, and used "GOOP" adhesive to make the screen lean forward. Now I can read it!  Someone at Scwinn did not do the Q.C. on that screen issue.Anyway, great bike, now I'm happy.
Baby Einstein has done it again!  They have created an engaging learning toy that both babies and parents love.  The best part of it is (they call it) the activity star.  It's what many of those cute babies in the customer images are smiling up at.  The activity star has different settings for playing music:  on, short play and motion activated.  It's also got a smiling face in the center and lights on each star-tip that flash along with the music.  My 3 month old daughter loves the smiling face and flashing lights.  Compared to other play mats in the same price range, this one is the best (in my opinion).
We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old. He would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time, which bought me time to do housework around him, etc.  You can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there's always variety.  I'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl. I bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $35 I spent. I wouldn't spend much more than that.
We originally set this gym up for our son when we moved into our new house, and had nowhere to put him (he was 3 weeks old).  As time went on, it just became convient to put him on the mat, close to us.  It was really fun to watch him grow into all the toys!  He started by just swinging his arms, and finally has learned to grab and interact with the toys!  He loves the star in the middle.  He could spend all day talking to that thing alone!  He loves this gym so much that we take it everywhere we go.  I highly suggest this gym for any baby!  It is something that us or the baby couldn't live without
I bought this DVD set at a warehouse store yesterday and I've just finished the first workout.  There are some familiar moves from the original TAE-BO tapes, but these exercises are much more challenging.  The 'Billy Bands' add resistance to the basic moves.  This allows you to get a strength, cardio and flexibility workout in one.   The choreography is really simple so that even the least co-ordinated people should be able to stay in step.  This is a very challenging workout, and might be a little difficult for people who are not in shape.  If you are moderately fit, you'll find this workout to be fun and very motivating. According to my heart rate monitor, this workout burned a little less than 700 calories, so it will be a great substitute for a jog when the Seattle rain hampers my enthusiasm to exercise outdoors.
It had special meaning for me, because when my two daughters were little (they are now in their late 30s), I taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they didn't flush.  I caught them both with the Toilet Monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences.  It is more funny than scary, though it does give you a start when you first open the lid
Most posters here haven't actually bought/used a Toilet Monster.  It's a really great joke/prank.  We bought one and used it for my mother-in-law.  She was stunned and a bit disoriented...then...wait for it...she laughed really really hard.  It's not scary, just startling.  The way we installed it, if someone opens the lid and seat, they won't see it, so it's best to try on women.  Great for the price
This monster is great...my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already, and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit. We heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor...luckily she hadn't gone to her attorney's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all...thanks toilet monster..you were worth the $15 + $5 shipping we paid for you
I bought the large for my 90lb 11 month old lab/great dane mix and it is pretty big on him.  Admittedly he's still pretty skinny despite his weight but I had to tighten the straps all the way in order to fit him.  Probably better for broader dogs but I'm sure mine will grow into it :o )The quality is excellent and there's plenty of packing space, overall I'm pleased with it especially for the price.  If your dog is skinny/narrow I'd order the next smaller siz
We just got it, I first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine, and I let it sit for a day and a half.  It lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time. Shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long. We are in the Caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight. This works perfectly.
This flashlight is simply awesome if you just have a little common sense. This is meant to be an EMERGENCY flashlight and if you use it as such, it is great. This is definately not a spotlight type of light and it isn't meant to be. But when you need some light in an emergency, a little shaking and you have some light. It's starting to dim? Just shake it some more and voila, more light. You could be lost miles from anywhere and you know your batteries are not going to go dead on the walk for help.I don't know why people are giving this bad reviews. This is so easy my 6 year old niece can shake it and get it working. And if you are smart enough to shake it like the instructions say, the light will last longer then people on here are saying. If my 6 year old niece can figure it out, I would think that adults could too. But, there are always going to be people out there who complain about everything. This is an emergency, no battery SHAKE flashlight. I think some people were expecting a flashlight that would shake itself. You should keep one of these flashlights in your vehicles, campers, boats, kids rooms, etc. How many times have you went to get a flashlight and the batteries were dead and you couldn't find new ones? This one has worked everytime I have uesd it. But then again, I do have common sense. This flashlight is Great!
This was a gamble since it isn't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign.  I only tried Muscle Milk because I read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an NFL athelete during an ESPN interview. I started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily. Two months later my strength has increased, my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished.

The fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of MM I would still use it if it tastes like battery acid. Do not fool yourself, it is loaded with fat. It relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it's true benefit. You will not get sculpted by using MM without commitment, you will only get fatter. But if you are committed and use MM as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance. 
I use this pillow in the car and plan to take this on the plane.  I do not like the neck pillows and prefer the rectangular shape of this pillow.  It rolls up to a nice compact size
I guess I did not read the description...an adapter is required to PROPERLY  use this. I will either buy the special adapter or adapt it to  my bike rack
We got this bike for our 4 year old, and it is sturdy and rugged enough to last the next few years. The assembly instructions looked intimidating at first, but since many pieces are already pre-assembled you can skip most of them. It was a lot easier than anticipated. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars: It had a deep scratch/paint chip on the frame. But since I got this during a sale for a great price and considering it was needed the next day we kept it anyway
I BOUGHT THIS BIKE FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE LOVES IT!  NO PROBLEMS WITH IT SO FAR, IT IS BUILT WELL AND THE PRICE WAS AWESOME.
This really is a cool, pedal-free bike.  We got it for our three-and-a-half-year-old, and he really likes it. Friends of ours (with more disposable income) bought their daughter a Like-a-bike, which is about twice the price.  I have yet to discover any big difference in performance.     The Like-a-bike is certainly nice-looking, if a bit precious, since it is constructed primarily out of wood.  The Kettler looks fine, however--more like a "real" bike, in fact, and less like a museum piece.      The only reasons I wouldn't give the Kettler five stars are:1.  you need to assemble it, and the instructions are not great (my husband, who is generally a handy guy, managed to get it together, but not without some swearing)2.  the wheel covers make it hard to inflate the tires
We bought this bike for our bike mad son when he was 1! My hubby had to take the seat off so that he could totter around on it. By the time he was 2 he was literally racing around on it, gathering up speed and then picking his feet up and cruising along for ages. Needless to say he was cycling on a proper bike shortly before his 3rd Birthday.(He just got on the bike for the first time and cycled off) His sister is now  nearly 2 and is already following ing his footsteps. Dont just think about it , buy it. And the sooner the better. Other friends have bulkier versions but the kids cant handle them like this one. And forget the versions with brakes, the kids should only go as fast as they can handle
Our 5 year old hated riding her bike with training wheels because she felt like it was too tippy and we wondered if she would ever figure it out.  Then we found this one  got it for her for Christmas and she *loves* it.  After 3 months she can now ride a traditional bike with NO training wheels and she was the youngest on the block to do so.  It is all due to this bike.  I never would have believed it since she was *petrified* of riding a bike WITH training wheels before.  And when the other girls on the block took off their training wheels, there were lots of tears  they screamed for their training wheels back!   And their parents had to run along side them for days trying to teach them how to balance but our daughter just took off and we didn't even have to help her.Now we are loaning out the Scoot so the other kids can learn to balance too!  In fact I just ordered our 3 year old a bike with pedals  I'm pretty sure he can ride without the training wheels too, the way that he speeds around on the Scoot!  It was well worth the purchase
The cord-wrapped handle is a great idea, offering more of a real sword-like look as well as a firmer grip. My hands tend to get sweaty and slip around a bit with long practice, particularly with the sealed lacquered finish on most bokken. This wrap really helps (though it needed a touch of glue to get it to stay in place). The two-piece guard design is a nice enhancement too. Though you really don't need the guard at all for many applications it is nice looking and appears stronger than the original.It's still a fairly cheap piece of wood, compared to an ironwood version, but at this price (it was $9.99 when I bought it) you really can't go wrong. A nice enhancement over the basic bokken. I do, however, prefer the natural wood version to this one as it looks pretty bad once you start using it and the color scrapes off. Nevertheless, if you want an inexpensive practice sword this one is recommended...
We bought this tent to travel with our newborn to the beach and it is amazing. the setup is quick and we are the envy of all beachgoers. It is lightweight and well constructed. I highly recommend this to all who desire shade and comfort
This is the best! I love it and use it to roll out the muscles in my tight calves. Its made me a better runner. My husband loves when I take it to his tight shoulders... I can massage him so much longer than I could before. This is a great purchase
Never thought I'd own a hyd pack, but now I don't know what I'd do without one.  This company offers free lifetime tip replacement.  Previous reviews are accurate-- no initial taste or odor.  Take proper care for long periods of storage (rinse with lemon juice or baking soda) and you'll enjoy a long life out of this.  Zippered pocket is nice, too
This is exactly what I wanted!I've had so many slipping problems in my Ashtanga yoga class. Both my hands and feet would slide and it was soooo hard to hold poses. Here is the answer!It works great! I'm very happy.
I was skeptical of buying this because I wasn't sure if it would work and would stop me from sliding around on my mat in my heated yoga class - I had been using a towel for a while but it wasn't helping - this product is amazing and I don't slide around at all anymore - I even bought one for my friend and she loves it too. I bought a yellow mat because I loved the brightness and the only thing to be aware of is that the lighter colors show dirt more - obviously it washes out but it's visible during class. Definitely worth the money!
This is a fantastic product at an incredible price. I am amazed by the quality and the free shipping makes it even better. It has completely eliminated my lower back pain, the chiropractor never did that. Buy this table
We researched for a secure and good value inversion table and decided to buy this model. This is a very low price for such a good quality inversion table. The ankles are comfy and secure. The DVD shows how to incline gradually and adjust it just right. As you assemble it you can notice that there is little room for something to go wrong from its good engineering design. The best part is using it. It feels so good to feel your spine expanding and blood flowing to new areas. I can't wait to use it again. We love it. 
This wiffle bat is light and easy to use.  Substitue it for a whip or crop when training your young horse.  It will not hurt the horse, but will get the horse's attention
One thing I really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use.  It holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride.  It feels good on your back too.  It helps in this Florida heat.Cons:  The mouth piece is hard to hold onto because of the 180 degree angle.  It would be easier to have a T mouth piece.  I will be looking for a replacement. 
This is a minimalist kit which isn't really suited for everyone, it is also overpriced for the items in it. What it is good for is to get you thinking what YOU need in your survival kit and to understand that you can make it very compact. Overall it's a good starting point and a lot better then nothing
My table was shipped on a Thursday and at my house the next day!!!  As someone mentioned, the directions make it seem more difficult to assemble than it is.  There aren't that many parts to put together.A tip:  Because of the weight of the box, I recommend opening the box and taking the parts to their destination individually.  Ours is on the third floor and I took about three or four trips to get everything up there.I use it daily and really miss it if I don't get to.  I could really go for some inverting right now.  I found the cuffs very comfortable.  Shoes/boots are helpful, but my body has adjusted to hanging from my ankles even in socks.  I should get commission on these things.  The first weekend we had it, we had a birthday party for my sister and everyone tried it and many will buy it.  GREAT deal!!
These skates were a bithday gift for my child.  The really fit well and will roll well even on our dirt drive. 
This skate was purchased for 6 year old granddaughter and given as a "Santa" gift...the hit of the day!  Although she hasn't had much opportunity to use them yet, she did try them out one evening at an indoor rink and they seemed to work just fine.  They are nice looking and fit is true to size
I wanted a simple, portable way to enjoy moving my body more.  This is it.  I just hop on it during commercials or when I need to get up and move from my desk.  It works. 
My husband and I purchased this bike to replace my 4 year-old son's 12inch toddler bike.  Our son loves that the bike looks like "a big kid's bike" with it's hand brake.  I was concerned that my son wouldn't be able to squeeze the hand brake hard enough to make it work, but he has had no problems!  In addition, the bike still allows him to brake the more traditional way by pushing the pedals backwards.  This bike will be a great transition into the next level of bikes with gears and hand brakes! 
I purchased the Valeo 10lb medicine ball for my son who is training for basketball. This ball has a very durable rubber covering and has some bounce to it.  This ball also has the same bumpy grips and dividing lines like a basketball.  Plus it is the same size of an official size men's basketball.  Color is also very nice
i use this bag while attending classes in college and it is perfect for all my needs
In these days and times backpacks, bookbags, etc have become so outlandish.  This is a classically styled all american backpack.  No bells, no whistles, just a good ole standbye bag! Hard to find now-a-days. 
.....that's the day that the first WIFFLE BALLS (invented a year earlier) went on sale in this baseball-crazy country.  Mr. David Mullany created the first Wiffle Ball in Fairfield, Connecticut after seeing his 12-year-old son struggling to throw a curveball.  Mr. Mullany (to whom we bow down and show obeisance) cut eight oblong slots into plastic orbs that were used to package cosmetics and the Wiffle Ball, an American institution, was born.Oh, Wiffle Ball, Wiffle Ball, it nearly compels me to wax poetic.  I'm now 46 years old, but the love that I have for the game of Wiffle Ball will possess my heart long after my body has any capability to throw a breaking pitch!  My Brother and I were born to a beautiful, baseball-loving woman.  Shirley grew up following the Cincinnati Reds, and as a child, she acquired a nickname based on a long-forgotten Big League pitcher.  As an adult, she worked for the Los Angeles dOdGers and the Los Angeles Angels (that was before they became the California Angels, and then the Anaheim Angels, and then the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and then the Chicago White Sox victims).  She instilled in her two boys and one daughter a love for America's pastime.  (In fact, my sister was the first girl we ever heard of to play on a boys Little League team.)But when we weren't on a baseball diamond with 7 other guys, and when we couldn't scrounge up two other guys to play a game of "Over-The-Line" at the park, my Brother, Doug, and I were battling it out in a game of Wiffle Ball in the yard.  We had some outrageously competitive games in our "Glory Days."  We perfected the art of pitching a Wiffle Ball, and baffled many a batter who tried to hit us.  I remember 1990 and a young, athletic college student who, claiming to have played Wiffle Ball throughout his childhood, challenged this old geezer on the UCLA field behind the John Wooden Center.  Well, my screwball was only breaking about 10 feet that day, and after taking it for strike three about a dozen times, he just shook his head, and I concluded that whatever game he was playing as a child, it WASN'T what my Brother and I called, "WIFFLE BALL."If you have never owned a Wiffle Ball, you've never really been alive, my dear friend!  Although they do tend to crack between the oblong cutouts after some time (especially if you hang too many curveballs for my Brother who swings with great authority), they will last for countless hours of baseballesque bliss and excellent exercise!  They can be used anywhere outdoors because the Wiffle Ball weighs only two-thirds of an ounce, and if Doug never knocked one through a window, neither will you!And although the Wiffle Ball is light, it does not follow that it should be taken lightly.  After San Francisco Giant (man, do I hate the Giants!), Kevin Mitchell won the 1989 National League MVP award, he publicly stated that he had really learned to hit the curveball by playing a lot of Wiffle Ball the previous off-season.  One of the greatest hitters of all-time, San Diego Padre, Tony Gwynn used to hit Wiffle Balls off of a batting tee because he could tell from the spin where he had struck the ball.  Play with a Wiffle Ball and you're in Big League company!The Wiffle Balls offered here are the regulation 9 inch variety.  (And SURPRISE!  They're still made in the U.S.A.  The day production moves to Communist China I'll jump.)  Twelve Wiffle Balls are currently going for $14.95, that's only $1.25 per ball.  Do you have any idea how much fun you can have with a Wiffle Ball?  Well, take my word for it, you'll get more than a dollar and twenty-five cents worth!Now all you need to do is get the regulation, Old School, plastic yellow ("banana") bat.  Of course, if you really want to splurge you can purchase the newly invented aluminum Wiffle Ball bat.  Funny story : My dear ol' Ma bought an aluminum Wiffle Ball bat as a gift for my Brother on his birthday.  But she wasn't sure what size to get, so she called the company.  "How old is your son?" the representative asked.  When she said, "41", he laughed loud and said, "I think you'll want to go with the heaviest model."One of the great disappointments in my life (SERIOUSLY!) is that they didn't think to organize Wiffle Ball competitions until Doug and I were in our 40's.  We scouted out the competition at the "Wiffle Ball World Series" here in Phoenix a few years ago. (Players fly in from all over the country!) We figured that even at our advanced age and with my arthritis, we could still give those young studs all they bargained for and more, if we polished our long-neglected technique over the next year.  Alas, it never happened, what with work, and life, and all the other crap that gets in the way of Wiffle Ball play.But that doesn't mean YOU can't fly into Phoenix next year and win the title!  Get to it, man!  Get yourself a dozen Wiffle Balls, a "banana" bat and start practicing.  Hint : the ball breaks in the direction of the solid half.  Want to throw a drop?  Make sure the solid section is on the bottom at your release point.  Then get inventive; there are innumerable variations on that theme!  You can thank me for the hint when you see me.  You'll recognize me because I'm always the guy who picks up the suitcase that comes around on the airport luggage carrousel with a plastic yellow bat strapped across the top of it!     
my second pair. Knew exactly what I wanted. small woman with small hands and small fit perfectly. great deal
This rack works perfect for me. It as easy to assemble and its easy to use. It folds up to put in the corner of the garage when not in use. My bikes have curved cross bars, so this mounting style was my only option, and it works great
Its a good sword i put it through my room door no prob
It cost 3 times its price just to ship, I didn't really expect to be amazed, but it is sturdy, if plain. The sheath doesn't really make it a decent wall display, but I think it will out last any cheap show sword
This is a beautiful, slim, sharp, functional, fast knife. The knife is slim, and with the clip can be carried easily in your pocket. The safety on the end of the knife is a little stiff, but can be adjusted so that it is easier to slip on or off.The pocket clip is reversible, allowing you to carry the knife point up. This is a great feature, because when the knife is carried in your pocket point up, you do not have to swing the knife around in your hand to get it in position for opening. The knife can be deployed much quicker when carried in this fashion.The speed-safe index opening flipper works very well, opening the knife quickly with just a little pressure on the mechanism. No grand flourishes, thumb strength, or wrist flicking is needed to open this knife.The finish is good, the quality is great, everything about this knife is amazing. A great knife to own.
The Leek is a wonderful knife, but its sword-like point is subject to breakage. (Throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip--which is what happened to two of my Leeks!) Fortunately, Kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand-new ones, no questions asked. I just shipped them the knife, explaining what happened, and a week later got back a new knife.The knife itself opens beautifully, though I've found that the liner lock sometimes sticks and isn't that easy to depress with one hand.
It's an ok knife. That picture of it can trick you. If you look at the middle of the page, it says "we ship black if we are out of silver". Don't get me wrong, black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green. The odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery, so I hope you like black weapons. The tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley. Just try not to poke an eye out. When will you need a LED light on a sword??? Unless your fighting ninjas in the dark. Do you know why this weapon is so cheap? I think that it's shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive. Just don't challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine. P.S. If you're looking at my account name, I am not neil meislin but I am related to him.
I am very satisfied by this short sword and by its cutting abilities. The sheath however is very soft and prevents the sword from quickly putting in it
This sword is awesome. I thought it would be cheap metal because of the price, but it is even  better than some of the other swords I bought for more money
The item is nice, but $15 for shipping on each blade is outrageous. I know that if you shipped two of them together, it wouldn't cost $15 for both of them, let alone separately. And everyone wonders why their items are so cheap..
this ninja sword is nice and has a light on it that makes it even coole
The yoga studio where I take classes has a very hard floor and I have bunion problems.  This mat is the solution.  There is only one downside to this mat: standing one legged balancing sequences are alot harder with this mat.  However, since I take 3 power classes a week and 4 ballet classes a week I like the challenge.  The upside is you don't have to worry about putting a towel under your knee or anywhere because the mat is to thick.  I did place a skidless towel on it and it does move around quite a bit so I would not recommend using a towel over this mat it just won't stay in place. I will take the not so bad with the overwhelming good with this super squishy mat
Overall, I'm very happy with this mat.  At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like the mat because it had an unpleasant smell but the smell disappeared within a week or two.  I also, initially, didn't like the fact that the mat was rolled so tightly that it wouldn't lay flat but I solved the problem the same way a previous reviewer did - just turned it over. 
thanx for the great mat! i hope to become a better golfer because of it
This bag is much better than the normal bop bags as far as rebound action.The old style falls all the down to the ground an then SLOWLY comes back to standing position.This one much more like a real bag snapping back and not hitting the ground unless you hit it to hard of coarse.My kid's are 4 and 5 years and only use the bag SUPERVISED being taught PROPER punching/elbow/knee and kicking strikes!I would never leave this bag alone with them to thrash on , it would break real quick and with a h20 base ,not good.GREAT FOR  YOUNG KIDS TO LEARN ON....(NOT BEAT ON)   the key is always, learn to strike GOOD then worry about how hard...
I live in san francisco and we bike everywhere so I'd been trying to find a new bike trailer for my 2.5 yo daughter who outgrew her front mounted baby seat.  Everywhere I went the trailers were priced at $250 plus.  I was a bit skeptical about buying this Instep because it was a "no name" brand (wrong - it turns out that its made by Schwinn) although it was priced at about half the price on others.  When I research the product I found it to be lighter than the pricier brands.  It runs smooth, easy to attach/detach.  I keep the stroller front wheels always mounted so that I my daughter falls asleep and i wnt to walk around she's can continue sleeping.  I recently did grocery shopping with the trailer and my daughter.  It has a rear compartment that fit 3 traderjoes paper shopping bags, an additional bag in the front with my daughter, and one more on the rear basket that is mounted on my bike.  I've also taken my daughter an another of her friends (it sits two kids) and they loved it.  Overall, a very good product - although not a sleek and cute as others like the burley - but its lighter, and priced much below comparable products
This knife's single blade, a bottle opener, nail file, and two flat-head screwdrivers (one large, one small) come packed in a slimline aluminum case. There's a can opener, too--though I've never tried to use it--and a panel on one side that can be engraved. It's an elegant package and lightweight. Once you're used to this little buddy, you won't want to carry the standard red plastic version.The only caveat: Don't take this to the airport. It will be confiscated. NOTE: To avoid losing it, you can attach a cord or thin chain to the small ring at the end. With this, a woman can attach her knife to her purse, and will be automatically reminded to return it when the task is done. A man can attach the chain to a belt loop. Until I did this, I had several "walk" after lending them to someone who needed a knife "just for a minute."
Very well made product; easy assembly and mounting.  The no wobble feature is excellent.  Highly recommend this product
This bike mount is solid and well made. The instructions were clear and easy to follow for assembly. There is absolutely no play or wobble when traveling with bikes mounted.The only weak spot is lack of padding on the vertical frame to prevent scratches on the bike frames. We added some padding and taped it on and it works fine, however
The item was delivered quickly.  As advertised have not hadany problems at all the stiching was fine.  I would purchase again from this supplier
This rack was great and easy to install.  But I never got a chance to put my bike on it for the night I installed it some person backed into and ran off.  What made it even more sad was the bolt that locks the rack into my hitch was bent in the hitch.  Since I was poor and not willing to pay someone to cut it off I painfully unscrewed it which took hours and blisterd hands.  Over all I though it was a great rack I just wished someone did not back into it but I know for a fact it did some harm to that persons car/truck. 
The mirror and its attachment is better than the ones I have purchased, however, the attachment does not addapt to all helmets. I have two helmets by Specialized: one I had no problem attaching to, the other, the helmet bindings were in the way and could not get the mirror attachment to fit properly. It would be to your advantage to research and design the mirror attachment to fit all helmets. This would help the buyer from purchasing a new helmet just to fit the mirror attachment. Whether or not you print this review does not matter to me. This review is intended for your design department. Thanks for the mirror
This is our second set of eyeglass mirrors. They are easy to use and once you get used to using them you don't want to go anywhere without them. I even find myself checking my "mirror" when I'm walking and don't have it on. One drawback that we've found is that if your frames are flimsy they could get bent. But that hasn't really been an issue for us.Give these easy to use mirrors a try. I won't ride without one
works like a thermarest. easy to roll up and store.  Wish I didn't have to buy the carrying case separately
If you're looking here you're obviously interested in playing better golf and therefore YOU NEED TO OWN THIS. Jim Hardy has figured it out.  Forget everything else you have heard about the golf swing and listen to why the proper thing to do is: - take the club to inside and up on the backswing, - keeping the clubface closed until you reach the top wherein you rotate your forearms to make the clubface open,- and on the downswing you need to keep your arms behind you (some might say "stuck"), while simultaneously "coming over the top" to get the club out in front of your body, - and swing well to your left to complete the through swing (i.e. never "down the line.")  Yes, this sounds like the exact opposite of everything you've ever heard.  But then again employing your current method are you truly satisfied you are getting the most of your abilities?  In most cases if one is being honest the answer is "no." So it stands to reason your technique is wrong and instead of blaming yourself it's time to give Hardy's "Plane Truth" a try. In addition to the video series which is amazing, I would also recommend both of Hardy's books as essential material. You want to get them all to keep reinforcing the proper fundamentals and since each has subtle differences in description and new drills, you're more likely to find the keys that really make the difference for you
The Thule Sidekick was the perfect size - not too big, not too small.  It did not appear clunky-big on top of the car, nor was it too small to fit anything in.  The assembly was a snap (did it with only one person - no problem).  It withstood freeway speeds in Oregon rain without even letting a drop of moisture into the box.  Highly recommended
I was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy.  I need a cargo box that I can put up alone on top the Acura MDX-just the right size.  The box was easy to assemble - less than an hour.  It is also easy to attach to the vehicle.  The box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver MDX.  I just wish the plastic was a little thicker but I think it will hold up well.  The box is sturdy after assembling i
This item was fairly easy to assemble.  Would be easier with 2 people but I put it together in less than 30 minutes.  It was easy to mount onto the roof rack as well.  Bought this for a long car trip but wanted to take a trial run with it of about 500 miles round trip. On the trip we ran into some rain and a couple of quick downpours.  The carrier held up well.  I had a couple of drops of water on the inside and that was my fault.  It was obvious that it was from the unused holes in the bottom for attaching it to the roof rack and I forgot to use the covers for those holes.  Overall it help up great and expect it will do well for our trip to Florida
I am very happy with the trainer.  Most impressively, it is much quieter than my previous mag trainer. I can easily listen to music while riding without the music being so loud it bothers the rest of the family. I ride about 30 minutes a day on it .... it is a great part of a cardiac risk factor prevention program
I purchased the Kurt Kenetic two months ago, and am thrilled with its performance and quality. If you are considering purchasing a trainer, fluid trainers are the way to go. Basically, there are four major types of trainers: Magnetic,Wind, Rim Driven, and Fluid. The later is the best, hands down! Fluid resistance trainers are more quiet, smoother and more realistic than any of the others mentioned. The only drawback to the fluid trainer is that over time they can leak resistance fluid.  There are three companies that have solutions to this drawback. I highly recommend that you research all three and test them out where possible. A good review page is Roadbikereview.com . The CycleOps Fluid 2 is ultra smooth and quiet. They have a limmited warranty on thier products, but are known for standing behind their trainers for life, and will fix any issues probably for life! The One Up Trainer has all the advantages of a fluid trainer, but uses no fluid in its designe, it is made in America and carries a life time warranty. The Kurt Kinetic, which I decided to purchase, is IMHO, the best because it utilizes a sealed fluid unit and therefore is guranteed not to leak. These three units are roughly the same price, around $260.00. Steep? Think of it this way, This product is going to be your companion for many winters, so don't buy a loud, crappy one with crappy customer service! You'll regret later that you didn't spend the extra $75 or $80 on a quality product. I also tested the Blackburn Fluid, $100 bucks cheaper, not bad for price, but since it is new to the market I was unsure about durabillity or how well they stand behind thier trainers after warranty expiration. I have heard amazing testimonials of how Cyclops, Kurt, and One Up, have replaced parts and even whole trainers, no questions asked! Google these three companies and see for yourself
Practice sword is of superior quality.  For the price it cannot be beat
I found myself staggered with sticker shock while shopping for a decent pair of MTB glove, 30-40 dollars. No offense to the makers of these woefully overpriced digit protectors, but please! I did some research on the web, and the Harbinger gloves received good reviews from a couple different sources. The price was a fourth of the competitors, so I thought why not try them out. The gloves are great, and I have been very pleased with their performance. Not only do they have a cool look factor, but they also are well made. There is decent cushion(no gel unfortunately)built into the meaty areas of the palm, where you would expect and need it. Additionally, the velcro connection comes a little higher on the wrist,for full palm protection, which I like. Another nice touch is the tough  material used in the palm around the thumb and fingers. It serves the dual purposes of protection and grip. It is definitely tough and has handled some hard, hands first, touch downs.On the downside, I know I might get sweaty hands this summer(live in SW desert) because the palm area is all plastic verses leather. Yet, this is a fair trade for the protection and rugged construction. If you dont want to spend 40 bucks on gloves, and dont need  to have a gel cushion these are the best bang for the buck
You won't believe how many exercises you can do on this home gym.  It takes up very little space and there's even a diet plan included
I just wanted to comment on Sarah's comment which highlighted 3 intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together.  My son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help.  I agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated.  I took it in parts after reading it fully twice.  After all the small parts : pole, height adjustment apparatus, rim / backboard, i carried it all outside and put it togehter. One picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard.  Overall I got it done in parts, total time 2.5hrs with breaks in between.  Have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten. 
Let me just start this review out by making it clear that i am a huge basketball/NBA/WNBA/CBA fan. I picked up this basketball and started dribbling it. I was amazed at two things. First of all, it bounces really high and you very rarely have to keep pumping it up like you do with some other basketballs. You can use it both outside/indoors although it is geared for more indoors then outdoors. Second of all, the grip of the basketball is very good, so it won't slip out of your hands. This has been the only basketball that i have actually owned that doesn't slip out of my hands. To wrap things up, i will end my review by making it clear that you should go with Spalding and BUY THIS BASKETBALL
this gun is the best deal for anyone who wants to get started in airsoft, it comes with a ton of accesories and although it says it only has 200 fps, the distance is much greater and the hop up, the only reason i would not reccomend this gun is if you play tournament cause the people who do that have way better guns.O yea make sure u buy extra clip
great. if you need more mags, get this, it fits perfect. it is exactly what it says it is
Its weighted and feels quite real. It only holds 40 bbs, unlike said in the product review. Buy a bunch of these at the same time, because this company has outrageous shipping charges. I recommend taping two together (facing different directions) to reduce reloading time in a match
Does a fine job on furniture with a flea problem. Instructions indicate for use on clothes against mosquitoes and ticks. The active ingredient permethrin is suitable for killing insects indiscriminately. Has no odor and recent research indicates its effects on humans is minimal
The Drishti Yoga Strap is just great!  I've tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga.  (Several different studios, borrowed friends', etc.)  This one is excellent.  It's 2 feet longer than standards straps, but it's offered at the same price as standard straps - what a deal!  It's also thick and sturdy.  I would certainly recommend this product
My doctor told me that riding a stationary bike or swimming are excersize that I can do with my arthritic knees.  He's right!  I love this bike.  It's comfortable and the computer provides different programs to use or make your own.  It's everything I wanted it to be.  I was especially pleased with the service I got from Amazon.  The bike came in a box that was not strong enough for this piece of equipment and was pretty banged up when it got here.  The computer on the bike was broken and the tools and hardware for assembly were missing.  I notified Amazon and they had another bike here in two days and paid for the shipping of the old one back.  The second bike was not packaged any better, but it was not damaged as was the first one.  I love the quality of the bike and the service that Amazon gives.  Thanks Amazo
I purchased this bike for my wife It is an execelent product for the money it is very sturdy, easy to assemble (as long as your a little mechanically inclined). Its true if your less than 5'2" you will need pillows to get close enough to the pedals Im 6'2" and there is still room to move the seat back. Product arrived ahead of schudle and in good shape. My folks purchased a bike for $1200 yes it is nicer (the preset programs and overall looks)but not by much. I would buy this again if I needed to. Negatives- screen hard to read for shorter people. and you have to plug it in to a wall outlet.
I've had this bike for about a month now and it runs smoothly, went together fairly easy, and best of all ITS QUIET!  Something I seriously appreciate in exercise equipment is when I can actually hear the television over the machine.  The complaints about the box falling apart during shipping is legitimate.  The bike I received had a cracked cover because of the dent in the box (arrived when I was at work or I'd have sent it back).  When I called for service I was greeted promptly, promised a replacement cover, and told that although they were instructed to tell me ten days they'd bet more like 3-5.  They even suggested that I consider where I was in the setup before I assembled the bike and whether or not I'd want to take it apart to put the new part in.  Very positive experience... now if I could just get myself to spend more time on it
I ordered the Schwinn 203 just a week ago. It was eligible for free delivery and I took advantage of that offer. It stated that it would take extra time for delivery, however it arrived within a week. Though several have stated it was difficult to put together and took several hours my highly non-mechanical wife and I had it together in about an hour and fifteen minutes. The directions are a bit tricky but knowing that in advance from the other reviews helped. Once we were finished assembling it I got on it and started it up and began peddling. I was sure it was not working correctly becuase there was absolutely no sound at all--mechanical or otherwise. I then reached over and increased the resistance and found out it was working correctly. My wife and I both use it and love it. I am 325 pounds and it works great for me and based on several nights of extreme sweating during my workouts I don't expect to be 325 for long. Super bike!! Very pleased...besides this is what my knee surgeon suggested for rehabilitating a knee I torn up last year and it's doing fine
This is an item that will bring smiles to the faces of everyone except the person putting with it, as long as the control unit is in possession of someone else. It is also useful for true accurate training, but a little humor never hurts
My grandson is very happy with this gift.  It was well-represented and arrived in plenty of time for Christmas.  I would purchase from this retailer again
...so make sure you have one or you will be doing this all by hand, not to safe. Missing file holder is the only reason I don't give it five stars
As the 'blow up' float toys come and go, the Sea Breeze float still looks like new and is still the preferred float.  The only problem is sharing.  We love it
The ball is good overall.  One big issue, however, is that it picks up dirt quickly and becomes slippery to the hands then.  You'll notice this well as your hands become dirty after using the ball for sometime.  Yeah, I used it on a indoor wooden court :-
I bought this for my brother as a Christmas gift. He is an avid ballplayer, and he loves it. He says the surface feels a little different than other synthetic balls but it plays really well
One has to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this product based on one's needs or requirements. IMO, the pros and cons are...Pros: These tabs weigh only a few ounces, but can treat up to 20 liters.They are very effective at killing off viruses, bacteria, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium(EPA accepted). This product is great if you can't build a fire or boil water.Cons: One tab for one liter so unless you stock up, you can only support one person for 5 days if you use 1 gal. or 4 liters per day for roughly $10. Compare this to 96oz(~56000 drops) of Clorox for $4 and it only takes 16 drops to treat 1gal. of water. Katadyn claims that their tabs leave virtually no taste to the water, but I disagree. There is a very strange taste in the water that is less tolerable than chlorine IMO. Minimum treatment time is 30 minutes for both.Alternative: Boil water for 5 minutes at any desired quantity at virtually no cost! :
This product is wonderful!  It sure helps my son rest comfortably with a variety of music.  We received this when he was a newborn and he is now 2.5 years old and still loves it.  We keep it right next to his twin bed so he can turn it on whenever he wants and since he knows how to change the music he is in control of what he wants to hear. 
I had this set up in my daughter's crib when she was a baby.  It would light up the room just enough for her to feel comfortable but not so much that it kept her awake.  The music is very soothing and not as cartoony as you would think.  The unit would turn itself off after a period of time so I wouldn't have to creep back into the room hoping not to wake her.This is a wonderful crib toy.  I would recommend it for any newborn, especially those who have a hard time falling asleep
I agree that this is hands-down the best water bottle on the market.  Take a regular water bottle and add a flip-up bite valve that prevents leaks (just like on camelbak hydration backpacks).  The bottle also includes a removeable straw so you can drink without having to turn the bottle upside down.My only criticism is that the bottle is hard plastic and may break more easily than the soft plastic water bottles that you can buy elswhere.  However, the lid is a standard size and will fit on most other water bottles.  Thus, by combining the lid from this bottle with other water bottles, you can get the best of both worlds.Also, it would be nice if the bottle had an insulation option, so as to prevent condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle
My husband is an airline pilot, and since they took away his crew meals he needs meal replacements.  There frequently is not enough time between flights to grab a bight to eat in the airports.  This is his favorite flavor and often the hardest to find in the store.  Thanks for offering these by the case
I was worryed becuse the price was so good as to what the quality of this product would be, but as it turned out, the hats where great, and well worth even double what I had paid.  I got a cubs hat for my son who is seven and my boyfriend for Christmas.  Both of them had asked for one, and both decided to get on for the other one.  Unbenonced to eather on I ordered both hats at the same time and had them delivered.  Words can not discribe the joy that both of them had to discover that they had matching hats to wear at the same time.  Now both of them want tickets to a cubs game so they can wear their hats to it. . .I don't think I will be able to get such a deal on that
I ordered this for My daughter when she played t-ball. She played on the cubs team and it was great. Very durable, and adjustable
My daughter loves this toy.  It's brightly colored and she loves the honking legs.  The tail part is only about six inches long so unlike the previous poster I really don't see how a child could strangle themselves with it.  
This is a very good lock in this price range. The rubber shield on the outside prevents rust and the light on the key fob is useful at night. The only downside is the key. You must make sure to insert the key all the way before turning, otherwise you might bent the key
This is the best product of its kind that we could find.  We bought an extension as well.  All the pieces are light and easy to move.  I highly recommend it.  It's a good thing Amazon sells it, since ToysRus is discontinuing it
My kids love it, they play for hours in the garage. It keeps them away from the television and computer in the winter.  They are also exercising while having fun
What a beautiful bicycle!! I thought it was black and white from the photo but it's a really lovely forest green and white. It was really easy to put together myself.  My husband is really excited about it. He's pretty tall and this bike is more comfortable size for him than his last cruiser.  Very happy with this purchase! Great price too!  My own Schwinn cruiser came from a local shop and was twice as much. 
Don't listen to the uneducated reviews here. These are great for hitting the heavy bag, speed bags, focus mitts, etc. The length of these, 108", makes them easier and less bulky when using bag gloves. The 170-180" are for sparring and competitive bouts. That is why Ringside makes different lengths. There is also a 120" length, which gives me that little extra coverage but these are excellent wraps
These are excellent wraps but as people have noticed are junior wraps. As such, they're 108" long and are good for teens or women with smaller hands.Men should use 180" wraps. Everlast sell full length mexican wraps and you can buy them on Amazon
I have owned this bag for a few years and have found it to be an excellent bag for the gym.  My size ten running shoes fit fine and it is easy to store behind my seat in my car.  I am not sure if someone with a large shoe size...say 13 and above may have some trouble or high top shoes(basketball shoes) may find the bag a tight squeeze.  Overall very satisfied
My 12 year old daughter and I put together the trampoline in a few minutes.  I use it for exercise, I watch TV or put on the iPod and run on it.  Of course, the kids like to use it to jump.  It is lightweight and easy to move around.  Highly recommended
the trampoline itself is very hard and good condition for its size.but the blue cover for the edge which is round  i will rate it a 1  is very poor for the price paid for.yes, it boke already that is the blue cover for edge and i had it for at least 2 weeks on.
I paid less for this item then I would at a store, and it came to me!  I didn't have to carry a heavy item out to my vehicle, hassle with getting it into the trunk, and drag it into the house.  It was right there on my door step waiting for me.  I love Amazon
When I first got this scooter it was so hard to unfold that i thought that it was broken but you just have to be presistant, the other thing i don't like is how carfull you have to be to not go over or into any big cracks because the scooter will stop suddenly and be dangerous. overall this scooter is really fun and worth buying
This works pretty well to get back and forth between classes, although you can tell that it's a toy at heart. If you're looking for something fun and easy, I recommend this scooter
We are teaching my 6YO to ride a bike, but it's not going well.  He wanted a scooter, so I got him the Razor A2 and ordered the Razor Pro for me.  Very nice!  Supports my weight, is easy to maneuver, and is inexpensive!  The only problem is folding it up again when we're done - this is sometimes a bit tricky
We bought this for our 2 year old on his birthday. He loves it! His older brother (3 1/2) has the regular Razor scooter, but that was too difficult for our 2 year old to use as it does not stand up by itself. This kiddie scooter is more balanced and as a result our son can keep up with his older brother. Good for the younger kids, but it does not go as fast as the regular Razor. As a result he will most likely grow out of it in a year or two. Definetly worth the money though. He just loves it!
I looked at several therapy websites to find the perfect sized ball from my 2 1/2 year-old autistic son to use to bounce on - everything was too big and too expensive.  This ball is just the right size and price and it was delivered quickly
Included pump is very weak. Better to inflate the bed using your own mouth.
I had the original solid red Victorinox that was borrowed and never returned (It was about 10 years old and still going strong!)so I purchased this one.  I came back and bought about 6 more in sapphire, amethyst, and red for Christmas gifts.  Everyone loved them!  Small in size, but a real workhorse, and easily hangs on your keyring without excessive bulk.  It came in handy opening the boxes that were taped, and the blade easily opened the plastic packaging that comes on most items now.  I definitely recommend this product. If you have very large hands or need a larger blade, buy a larger knife; otherwise, this is the one you want.
The Kermis is bad-to-the-bone fast. This is not a bike for the average 'fred'. The Kermis is super stiff and fast and handles high and tight. There is an element of stability on climbis  descents too, as the bike is a flat-out roadster. I'm thinking of naming my first pet or kid Kermis in hommage to this great road machine
The bad news first: The extension cables are VERY stiff, and they're shipped in a tight loop. Don't expect them to straighten out easily. And they don't come with extra clips to attach them to the foot straps. I just swap cables from whichever Bowflex station I'm not using and get a much better feel. The ball ... is a ball. It does the job. The little pump they supply with it isn't great, but it also does the job. Maybe you'll tone your arms pumping up the ball. ;-) There's no check valve in the ball, so be prepared to get the pump out and the plug in FAST, once it's fully inflated. The mat looks a bit cheap, but it's comfortable and it does keep you from sliding around.The video is decent. Even if you already know what you're doing, it's worth watching to see how to do the moves using a Bowflex.So far, I wouldn't say you've even come close to justifying the purchase price. But those foot straps are just BRILLIANT! Once you've gotten them adjusted, they'll go on and off with no problem, making it easy to add stretches to a regular workout without losing your momentum. But once you have them secured they won't come off, or even shift much, when you're performing the exercises. That may sound like no big deal, but I've used straps that took forever to put on and wandered all over the place while doing the movements. The four points for cable attachment are well-placed and solid. I've been doing resistance stretches for a LONG time, and these are the best straps I've ever used. They're worth the price of admission
This mat is great.  My advice for all you yogis that can't keep your hands from reenacting Starsky and Hutch during downdog is to be a little patient or just creative.  You have two options other than getting upset and throwing your new (expensive) mat in the back corner of your closet.  First, I recommend that you buy an organic degreaser.  Give your mat a couple of sprays (not too much), give it a scrub with a brush, hose it off, and hang it out to dry.  This should help.  Option two is to put your mat in the washer on delicate cycle with cold water and baking soda.  Don't use soap unless you really want to be embarrassed the next time you start sweating in your sun salutes.  I put my mat in the washer and haven't had any problems, but I'm not sure if Manduka would actually endorse that.  With that, and a little bit of wear and tear, you should end up with a solid mat.
I bought this for my son who is 4.  He loves it and can operate it whith out any help.  Good quality and can take alot of abuse
The directions for this product were userfriendly which made the calibrations easy to set up. However, at times the product is very sensitive and reacts to any kind of movement (i.e. driving to work...??) Therefore, for the most part,  its very efficient and the benefits of knowing how many steps I take each day has been invaluable.
He's always been a Colts fan but with their Superbowl hype, this football couldn't have come at a better time.  Happy Birthday, D!    Can't offer anything but good reviews on the quality and look of the football
great condition...made a perfect gift for a friend collecting nfl footballs...and the dolphins are my team!! (she won't forget her gave her this one!) quick service...great packaging
i've had this gun a little over a mounth now and it still works great. don't bother useing the scope though it's a peace of junk the guns not acurit enough for it anyway. this gun is great for mid range rapid fire don't get this gun if u want a sharpshooter. the folding stock was broken when i got it but a little bit of vel crow fixed that easy. the strap also broke but a zip tie fixed it. don't get me wrong this it a tugh gun it's been drop, banged up and runs like new. so yea get it!!!!
Allright, thuis gun is so much more than i was hoping for. its accurate, and its an incredible price. its pretty hard hitting. i was putting holes in a cardboad box from 50 feet away.im not new to airsoft, and i really wish that my first gun was as nice as this oneif you take it out to have a little fight with your friends, i reccommend extra clips.the mag capacity is about 45, and the load time is annoyingly longa very good gun for all abilitie
I purchased the light and medium resistance bands over a month ago and they are still going strong! I use them a couple times a week during my pilates workout and they work perfect.
We bought this for our 8 year old son for Christmas. He absolutely LOVES It! It goes just fast enough and is well designed for a comfortable ride. Brakes work very well. Riders need to start off slow and get a feel for the turn radius. Given the chopper style, long nose...quick tight corners usually mean you are in for a fall. I suggest getting a motorcycle style riding helmet for safety.Easy to put together... a no brainer.Well worth the cost. He told us he loves feeling the wind in his face, shirt sleeves flapping...I think we have started something I may not want to deal with as he gets older. Future Harley riders look out!
Very satisfied to find this speedometer available.  Perfect to put with my Schwinn Cruiser Deluxe 7.....had been searching for something like this for awhile. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for retro gear
I am a 71 yrs young female. I purchased these "Men's" skates for myself. I bought a size larger and they are very comfortable. As an older "re" learner these skates worked out just great. The wheel's don't have speed, which is what I was looking for. They are indoor // outdoor skates. They work better for inside skating. A great price and a great quality skate. Especially for a beginner (the Wheels). No matter what age you are, these skates are the best. I love these skates
i bought these skates as a christmas present for my daughter and she skated around the house all morning for me this was a good buy
While I live and run in what I consider a "safe" neighborhood, I feel just a little safer having this baby on my hand just in case and especially when it's still dark in the mornings.  I also carry it when I'm walking my dogs in the afternoon
I bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in Colorado - I recently went in January and it worked nearly perfect! Every location I could find an elevation marker, the watch was within 10 feet. The thermometer works well also, it just cannot be on your wrist to read the temp correctly.The watch looks great, I wear it to work nearly every day. I would highly recommend it
I bought the X-Lander because I am a pilot and wanted a bit more information when I needed it. The watch is well designed and of good quality. A few things did disappoint me, but I think they are outweighed by the features, however.- It appears that it does not have a second time zone. Why they would not include this is beyond me. As a pilot I want local time in 12hour format and zulu time in 24hr format. A traveler would want time here and at home. It is not there, but is on other models they offer.- The dial is not the easiest to read and I had to use a magnifier to see the units information on setup such as feet vs. meters and celsius vs. farenheit. The display needs to be more vivid. The company does offer a white face with black numerals, which might be better.It is a nice watch, but not the greatest execution of the concept, especially for $300
this gun is awsome it is the best gun you will ever get for such a good price and guns that are 10 20 or even 30 dollars more the gun is very very light and looks great you can take of the front  and the arm rest to make it look like as machine gun or something scope is great and is a super accurate gun i have shot a can down from farther than 40 feet (one shot) the laser is not super good and hard to use but it comes seperate so you can put it on or take it of whenever a bb might ratle around in their once in a while but it will fall out over all greatest gun ever!!
I am the leader of a team called POINT 0 I got this gun about a week ago it rocks my socks. It shoots about 300fps or maybe a little more. The scope is ok and the laser pointing thing isnt to hot but it gives you an estamite at night. It holds 21 pellets and doesnt go out very fast the cocking thing is at the top. But do not use this in a war with automatics you wont compare unless your sniping. I am the leader of point 0 and this gun rocks
I order this gun from HIT on April 11, and i got this baby at April 14. Quick shipping and delivery. This gun is very powerful. 350-380 FPS with 0.12g 6mm BBs. Very accurate too. 5/5 to HIT! and 5/5 to this gun
I've been shot by many other airsoft guns, but this one really packs a punch...my back looked like it had measles after fully automatic. The automatic really drains the battery quick though and when its dead, it will scare you that you broke it, but no, it's just the dead battery. The metal gear box is extremely reliable and helps it shoot fast. This gun is a little overwhelming when looking at it to assemble, but be patient, it's actually easier than it looks. I highly recommend this gun
this gun shoots hard and fast!!!this is a metal gear box so it last forever!!!This is a must buy!!!believe me i know about airsoft guns and this is good!!
this gun is the best for your money and then some great battery life very accurate and strong perfect for competition. All metal parts great value probably the only gun you will find with metal gear box for this price its a steal
This lunch box is top quality, with lots of room for snacks and even lunch for two.  The quality is superior and I highly recommend it.  There is an area for your flatwear, salt and pepper shaker and other compartments for snacks.  There is even a compartment for your soda.   I have been shopping around for a quality lunch bag and this one is it.   Great for travel, work and picnics for two
I feel this product provides excellent Value for the occasional biker or hiker. While cycling I had filled the hydration bladder with water and ice. I also carried a 32oz bottle of gatorade in the the storage area. There was still plenty of room for snacks, keys, clothes etc. I purchased a Sony portable CD player/radio. It fits nicely in a special compartment with the headphone wires coming out of a slot in the top of the pack. My radio also has a remote which is great when you don't want to stop. The chest and waist straps hold the pack comfortably yet snugly to your body so it is not bouncing around.The one negative that would report is the bladder hook. Rhis is what the bladder suspends from inside the pack. I think it should have a latch or something to hold it more securely. What I found is that when you take it off, it may slip off and then it pinches the hose which prevents drinking. I try to keep the velcro that closes that part of the pack close to the hook. This seems to help.Overall though I am very pleased with my purchase.
These cars can be summed up in two words FUN and LOUD.  I have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends.  They work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well.  I am even thinking of getting a third.  They do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily.  Well worth it.
When the buggie arrived, it didn't work. I had to call Razor's Customer Service Dept. Their service is awful. The Senior Agent was very rude. I managed to figure out the problem on my own. The electrical unit was not connected. Once it was connected, it worked fine. We have two of them. The kids love them. They are lightweight and ride well on carpet. Overall, the product is good.
I am very pleased with this product. It is good quality, easy to use, and well worth the money
the bands were sent in a timely fashion and were exactly as advertised. Great folks to work with. Now if they could sell me some motivation to use them daily...I'd sure buy that too
I'd do business with these guys again.  The shipment made it on time and was just as I expected.  The only reason they got a four star was because one of the poker chip trays was damaged when I opened the box
Yea man soon as I got this basketball in my hands i had to play basketball right away nice grip and it came realy quick less then 4 days great B-Bal
This little device is easy to put together and easy to use.  Not for 'intensive' workouts however, you can pretty much use it anyplace you're sitting down.  That could mean even while the TV is on!  Like all exercise equipment, if you don't use it you lose it
Works great, keeps me from spilling on myself, especially when I have ice in there. Doesn't slip, fits just right. Easy to get in and out. The bottle top screws right over it.  I can toss it in the silverware spot in my dishwasher to wash.
Hot water in my flask doesn't stay hot enough for a whole day out, and this is a good way to bring my tea or coffee up to temperature. I haven't tried heating water from cold - it is always at least warm when I start. It takes several minutes and the wait can be a bit tedious, but it does a good job. The clip which is supposed to hold the heater onto the side of the mug doesn't (it flops about), so I have to hold it to keep it properly immersed. It cools off quickly and is reasonably easy to clean with a small brush
This is the first Cathe strength workout I've tried, and I found it to be intense and challenging without being gruelling.  However, keep in mind that this is an advanced workout, so intermediates like myself will probably need to lift less weight than Cathe (I generally used 1/2 to 2/3 of what Cathe was using) in order to complete the workout.  Cathe uses a variety of equipment in this workout, including a barbell, several sets of dumbbells, a full club step, and a toning band, but I was able to get by without the barbell, step, or band (although my modifications may have further lowered the intensity of the workout).The main workout on Muscle Max is 68 minutes long, but the DVD also offers several premixes:  Upper Body Only (42 minutes), Upper Body Push-Pull (33 minutes), Lower Body Only (23 minutes), and Timesaver (56 minutes).   The full workout breaks down as follows:  Warm-Up, Lower Body, Chest, Back, Lower Body, Shoulders, Bicep, Tricpes, Core and Stretch (the DVD includes subchapters under each of the above categories; see Cathe's web site for a full list of exercises plus video clip).  During the warm-up, you are constantly moving rather than performing static stretches, but I liked that Cathe still managed to thoroughly stretch each muscle group that was going to be worked.  Also, Cathe constantly varies the count, which adds interest as well as varying intensity to each movement.  Another thing I liked about this workout was that Cathe allows plenty of time between exercises, thereby providing you with an opportunity to rest AND to change your weights as needed.  I also enjoyed the upbeat music, some of it vocal.Overall, this routine left me feeling completely worked out, yet not exhausted, which means that it was enjoyable and has little dread factor.  I think that both advanced exercisers and intermediates who are will to modify can get a great workout from this video--highly recommended
This is a must for car tent camping. The main burner will boil 2 qts of water in about 5 minutes. Large enough to cook a complete meal small enough to be easy to pack
A great multifunctional stove with lots of room.  Extremely functional with three burners and the side flaps helped keep the wind, dust, and other campground debris out of your food.  Propane is the only way to go when you're cooking in the wild Woods were doing some backwoods camping.  While the stove has lots of room for cooking it folds down nicely making it a great compact pack along.  A must-have for any camping trip
The computer is really good and installs quite easily.  The only problem is the setting instructions for the functions (In 11 languages).  They are not very good (As noted in another review I read)
This bike computer tells you all the things you really need to know without giving you a whole bunch of stuff that would only complicate its use.  It is simple to install.  Works great.  Is easy to navigate.  And, is actually kind of fun to use.  I love being able to get a small report of my bike ride like average speed, distance, etc.  And, when I'm whipping down the trail I really like to look down and see how fast I'm going or get other statistics without having to stop and push a bunch of buttons
This bench is a must have for outdoor sports. This is the second instabench we have bought as the other one wore out.  It is sturdy and can comfortably fit a coach along with many players on this bench.  The bench itself is a little heavy and bulky but portable enough to throw into the car and go.  The frame is made well.  There were only two issues that I had with the bench.  The first is that the plastic material on the bottom of the seat separated from the top seating material.  Second is the carrying case ripped after a few months of carrying it back and forth to the fields. The top sides ripped along with where the shoulder strap meets the material on the bag.     therefore the rate of 4 stars
These are great cards, they can be bent and even get wet and the are still good as new. They are easily cleaned with a damp cloth. Perfect for the avid card player
I bought this helmet for my 3 year old.  He likes it, it seems to fit well, seems to adjust fairly easily, received good reviews from Consumer Reports.  The only thing I don't like about it is the chin straps seem to twist a little bit between the ears and chin.  My son hasn't complained about this being uncomfortable, but it looks like it might possibly be.  I can't see any way to straighten them out all the way from ears to chin, it's just the way they are attached to the helmet.  Generally though, I am very happy with it.Oh, another thing, in the photo, the helmet looks almost red, white, and blue.  It's really dark gray and black.  I think the photo doesn't show this actual helmet but the design (style and stars) are the same
This is a great helmet.  My daughter has been very happy with it and loves to wear it
I have camped for several thousands of nights in all types of weather.  Over the years I have had a wide range of camp cots including the same style as the xl camp cot but not the same size.  This cot will provide everthing that I'm looking for.  My sleeping bag is wide and fits very nicely on the cot.  The cot is eazy to set up and take down and fits nicely in the handy carring bag.  The only down side to the cot is it's not a back pack cot but again neither is my sleeping bag.  In short it's all a good fit and I hope to enjoy it for years to come.   Thanks Da
Sword looks awesome! very heavy and cool. Blade is strong but not sharp..for collector purposes. handle and point where blade connects to hilt is very shaky  but can be fixed quickly. Overall sword and scabbard are very realistic and cool looking
Received as promised, easy to assemble and works well though the fly wheel is making noise and will most likely require servicing
My daughter is 2 1/2 years old, 32 lbs. and I wanted to get back into jogging.  After reviewing many strollers I decided on this one for it's price and features (swivel front tire, rubber tires, tray for myself and my daughter-snacks and juice keep her from getting antsy on my runs).  I wasn't sure if she would be too big for a jogging stroller but she fits very comfortably in this one and hasn't complained during any of my runs.  It handles great too!!  My only complaint is that I have not found it as easy as other reviews say it is to fold up.  I have a SUV so it has not been a problem, but I must say for me it does not fold flat at all and I am not sure it would fit into a trunk. But, most reviews have have said it folds easy. Not sure what I am missing, but..
This is a great stroller and an awesome price on Amazon.  I wish I had it 2 years ago.  It folds nicely and isn't very heavy to lift in my van.  I use it for walking and the swivel wheel is great
I bought this coffee pot for home use in utter disgust with drip coffee makers.  Having had three different drip coffee makers stop working in one year, I decided to go with something tried and true.  And while you can't set it up to turn on by itself, I will never have to replace it again.  The color is beautiful.  It is a snap to clean up (just throw it in the dishwasher).  And, the coffee tastes so much better.  I now use less than half the amount of coffee grounds needed by a drip maker and am getting more flavorful, robust coffee and no bitterness.  I guess this is one thing that modern technology can't top.  I will never go back to and electric coffee maker
I just ordered this basket and it came in a totally different color.  Instead of the purple/blue it is a light aqua/blue color.  The basket is still cute...it just doesn't match my daughters bike as well as the other color would have.  I am sure she will love it just as much!  I just wanted to give everyone the heads up! 
This is one of the best racquets I have ever purchased. Ever since I used this racquet I have been playing better. The racquets smooth motion makes it suitable for people of all skill levels
Arrived just in time for the snow, my grandson who is 9 had loads of fun, however,it requires the user to have good balancing skills, like a skateboard. I would have given it a 5 star but it could have been faster had the plastic footing been a little thicker to eliminate the base from warping up in the middl
I got this for my daughter awhile ago, but due to no snow, I had to wait to actually see if it worked.  Well, it did!   Nicely made and durable.  Daughter loved it. 
The best bike ramp I have ever used. This ramp is good for going slow or fast. My friends and I went as slow as we could over it and we did not get stuck. This ramp will not breack. I live in an area of the country were it snows all the time and this ramp can handle the seasons. This ramp has been outside for two years and is in great condision
This is a real good ramp. I just got mine and me and my dad are going to build a roll-in ramp to put in front of it so you can come down it and get some major air! Overall a really good ramp besides the fact that it sometimes may move just a little but nothing major. It is good for even people who have been skateboarding for long time. They are fun and you will have hours of fun!!! :):):
I looked in Consumer Reports for the best treadmill for my dollar and deceided to buy this model. I absolutly love it! It was very well priced through Amazon.com and I thought the shipping was very fast.(About two weeks which is not much considering the weight). It is very heavy and well constructed. It does need to be put together, but I did it with my twelve year old daughter in about an hour with no difficulty. Everything is so well laid out for you, and the instructions were great! The treadmill is comparable to fitness center models! Very easy to operate. The folding is easy and it comes down very gently. I am very pleased with the Bowflex series 3 treadmill in every aspect and I thank Amazon for making it available for such a good price and free shipping to boot! 
A quality product. Low to the ground so very hard for a little one to tip over. Easy to assemble. Can't wait for the snow to disappear so we can take it outside! Have been riding it inside, mostly using our legs (we're not yet 2 yrs old) to scoot around. However, our bigger cousin (just turned 5 yrs old) had a blast with it and could still peddle without grinding his knees into the handle bars. This trike will last a long time and thru many kids
Very impressive, though it's a bit big for my two-year-old. He can't reach the peddles yet, but manages to push himself around without too much trouble. I think the size is really more appropriate for a three year old, or a BIG two-year-old. Seems solidly built, very sturdy/stable and sporty looking
This little trike is wonderful!!!  My 2 1/2 year old loves it, as does our 5 year old neighbor.   The ride is smooth, and the low center of gravity allows for the racer instinct of most toddlers, without the high risk of tipping over.  I looked for a trike for many hours/days, and am so happy with this choice
This is a pretty good quality pack for the money. It looks good and feels well built. The height adjustment is a little tricky to adjust until you get used to it. It uses velcro panels to hold itself in place (plus a locking strap to secure it once it's adjusted) and you need to pull them both out to be able to adjust it up or down. It was very comfortable to wear over the course of my very first 2 day backpacking trip. My only real complaint with this pack is that one of the accessory loops on the bottom of the pack which was securing my tent to the outside of the pack ripped about 3 hours into the first day, which required me to figure out another way to carry my tent. Fortunately there are plenty of extra loops/pockets to hold things and clip thing on with and I was able to use those to secure my tent to the pack. So you do get what you pay for but this is probably one of the better packs out there in this price range.
Great fun way to practice chipping in my backyard.  It provides a great way of having a backyard practice chipping game with my friends.  Another product that I found quite valuable is"The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better" by Patrick LeonardiThis book has very practical information on the short game and long game, which lead to my improvement on the golf range and on the golf course.  For leisure reading, I also suggest"New Rules: Polite Musings from a Timid Observer"  by Bill MaherThis book is hilarious, very funny observations about famous people in the world
I bought this bottle after reading a review that claimed it kept ice for 24 hours.  My girlfriend unwrapped the box on Christmas day, and filled it that afternoon.  It had ice still 2 days later.  Sturdy, effective, and comfortable to drink from.  I'm going to buy myself one too.
however it only a six day cooler if it rarely opened but it a great 3 day cooler in hot weather for normal opening to get drinks out of thant that is very impressive as most coolers can go more then a day or two when there opened frequently
I can't not imagine having a great machete, and it's easy for me to imagine many things I would want one for. This one is cheap, not very big, and of good-enough quality and the kukri style is great for cutting brush, chopping, and would be fine of fighting too, if you had too. Truly, unless you have more money you want to spend on a machete, or really don't need one because you never leave your house out of fear and don't play Jumanji or perhaps you have no arms...this machete is for you!With care...chop on...chop on...SamKoche
The best thing about this lantern is that it is rechargeable.  No extra batteries needed, just plug it in and go.  It is a quality lantern that is bright, and functional.  Overall, I am very pleased and I would recommend this product to my friends. 
This was a present on our girls 3rd birthday... She rode off an on from 2 until 9 She loved it so much we couldn't wait for the battery to run out. For the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car.  Quick to learn how to drive it... Loud?? a little bit but hey, it's a kids toy.  If they didn't make noise, the kids wouldn't like it.Great Toy!! Great Value!
I purchased this skateboard for my 7-year old daughter.  Her older brother is into rollerskating and she wanted to share in his activities, however, she didn't like the "boy" skateboards.  She loves her new Barbie skateboard
Very cute skateboard! Very girly! The only thing wrong with it is that it's very gritty on the top, which I'm assuming it's like that so that you don't fall off, however it hurts!! ouch! Other than that it's cute
It's ok. The bike is packaged well and is easily put together if one does not use the instructions. Good sturdy machine. A bit pricey
55cm is for people as tall as 5ft-5". So this works great for my wife but not for me. She is pregnant and so safety was my number one criteria for selecting this. This is an amazing anti-burst ball.
I love this Ab Wheel, but some of the reviews here are ridiculous, like when a woman claims it burned off 20 pounds in a month. That's  72,000 calories, or 2400 calories a day. To put that in perspective, you'd have to run 24 miles a day, every day, to take off 20 pounds in a month just through exercise.Let's say you can use this devise for 3 minutes before you tire out. Heck, give it the benefit of the doubt say 5 minutes. That means it might burn off 50 calories a day. If you did that every day (unlikely, because your abs would want some rest), you could burn off just under half a pound in a month. And that's based on some pretty optimistic assumptions.So it's not a weight loss device. But it IS a great ab strengthener, better than anything else I've use. It'll tighten up your stomach like crazy, and as long as you do some cardio to burn and keep the fat off, you'll end up with a great, flat, ripped up stomach.
Can't really go wrong here.  A metal post, some rubber grips, and a couple of wheels.  It works great, and was the cheapest I found.  Just a tip, if you've never used it before, don't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet.  You may be tough, but you might also hurt your back.  Start on your knees until you know for sure you're a tough guy
I have been using Michelin tires for the last 3 years, and I won't use another brand.  Hands down the best road tires you can buy!  Worth the money
The Good:* I couldn't find these in bricks-and-mortar stores at all, and it was a relief to purchase them affordably through a vendor I trust.* The 1-lb weight inserts make it easy to adjust the weight, with the cuff on or off.* I have been using them for about two weeks, and the effect on my workout - and my legs - is tremendous.The Bad:* The cuffs are "adjustable" with two LONG velcro straps that wrap all the way around the ankle.  No matter how carefully I wrap them, I just can't get them as tight as I'd like.  Straps which wrap  double back through D-rings would have been much more useful.* The cuffs tend to ride down and dig into the tops of my feet. Cushioned by gel or not, I can't exactly call that "comfortable."  I'm not sure whether this is specific to this brand, or typical of ankle weight cuffs.Overall:I do wish I'd been able to try these and some other brands before I purchased them.  However, I'm delighted to have found them and with the results I'm seeing
I was taking Hydroxycut but it stopped working.  GNC lady told me to switch to this.  First it worked GREAT, then about half a bottle down it stopped working.  Had to take more and more.  Went back to GNC.  Told me that anything like this will work when you first start and you have to start switching it up or taking more and more, and more, and more.  Told me I should switch product every one to two months.  Just wanted to recommend that you don't stock up on just one.  It will work for a while but plan on changing once you don't feel the effects anymore
They are made so well, operate smoothly all the time and fit so many useful features into a small package.  The other review about them just doesn't hold water.  You can open the knife with a few keys attached without a problem.  The keyring has to be on one end or the other,  but it is really not a hindrance
My son was very happy with the product.. good quality and well worth the money.
While there are those who will deride this product as an "air matress with sides" it is really a lot of versitile fun for the dollar. It gets you on the water cheaply and efficiently. It packs down small. I've had mine for the past three years, and have taken it on all sorts of water, from calm ponds to pretty big waves in rivers with fairly strong current. I've never had a problem. It holds me and my now 6 year old daughter perfectly. It replaced my old canoe and it has the following advantages:1) the bag fits easily in the trunk of my compact sedan2) I don't have to worry about the boat flying off the top of my car on the freeway3) the bag fits easily in the trunk of my compact sedan.It is seaworthy - I have even taken it out on Lake Superior (on a very calm day) and on day paddles into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. I love it.
I bought the large and X-large sizes.  I would say the large size is standard for most travel, but the X-large is best for packing clothes, because they quickly fill up space.  The large size also includes a small zippered carrying pouch
The "traditional" spork never impressed me much. This thing is a spoon with a USEFUL fork on the other end and a serrated knifelike bit that might come in handy here or there. Consider - the spork's obvious habitat is eating typical backpacker food when packing, typical microwaveable foodstuffs at the office, or the stuff in your wide-mouth vacuum bottle at the field jobsite. The Light My Fire Spork fits the bill to perfection
I was hoping for more of an around the wrist type Lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use. I needed it for the use of carrying around USB Flash Memory, but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller Clasps. I would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref's out there that need them for the whistles
This litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions.  It's collapsable, strong, light and easy to use.  I wish the price was under $[...], but the best price I could find was on Amazon.com and it's what my wife wanted and loves.  We also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly.  A GOOD PRODUCT!!
This is the best racquet I ever have. I'd been using Wilson for a long time (5 racquets) This one is the lightest and the most powerful. I have improved a lot. And no more pain in my elbow (tennis elbow) Thank you for such a great product
 This spring is of industrial strength. It can definitely support a heavy weight punching bag of 75 to 150 lbs. Better than any made available at your local hardware store. It's only about 4 in. long so it does not take up much space. However,if your ceiling/beams are not structurally sound, no spring coil can adequately prevent damage to them by absorbing the shock of using a heavy bag
I am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product, since Amazon/Toys R Us don't seem to have a clue - even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer. I bought this in-store at Toys R Us because sizing information was not available online (except for the size of the box, for some bizarre reason) and I didn't want to take a chance with getting the wrong size. So let me share that information with you - this helmet is suitable for head sizes from 20.5" to 22". I think overall that this is a great set, but I marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection. From my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard, I can say that I would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands, so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me. But with a young child who knows?! This is for my neice (I am not a parent) and whilst I am generally happy with the set as it is, I think it would be nice to include the elbow protection (which is afterall available in other sets, but does not appear to be available separately) to make a complete safety package. Perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads, or perhaps I am a touch too cynical
I recently purchased the tent cot and decided that it would be best to have the rain fly to go along with it. The rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners. Also, there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips. The sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you don't have it fully zipped up. My only gripe and the reason it doesn't get five stars is that I think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately
Treated myself to a yogitoes mat and I love it!  It's very absorbent (great for hot yoga) and very non-skid.  It allows me to focus on my practice rather than the distractions of slipping feet or hands.  Wonderful tool
I am very please with my purchase.  It is nicely constructed and a beautiful purple color
I recently purchased the GoFit 40lb weighted vest, and it's everything I hoped it would be. I was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts, and this vest has proved to be a good choice. The weight is balanced well between front and back of my body. The shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks. The velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement. I have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting, though it does hamper some bending movements. The weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter. I am well pleased with my purchase
I was hoping for more of an around the wrist type Lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use. I needed it for the use of carrying around USB Flash Memory, but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller Clasps. I would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref's out there that need them for the whistles
I purchased two of them for my twin boys, and they really love it. it is made pretty strong and can be folded easily.  The only negative point is that the wheeler can not be extended too much. so probably we will need to buy a taller one in a few years
this is perfect! the purple is a dark purple and my girl loved it! there's no confusing this scooter with her sister's (which is pink). she loved it and can't wait to get it outside to ride all day. thanks
We already have a few of these but not enough to go around. They are a lot of fun and hold up well. A good buy
This scooter seems better than the basic one because it is sturdier. It also has a fender type bracket over the back wheel so she can rest her foot without inadvertantly pressing on the brake. It can be a little difficult for a child to fold and unfold. She is 10 and got it for her birthday
The scooter ride is really smooth! FAST transportation and really fun down hills. The breaking is pretty nice and I like the wheelie bar too. You guys will love it - get it! People say scooters are only for little kids, but I'm 18 and i'm loving scootering around campus to classes and etc. Everyone does it and it really holds more than 143 lbs
i'm just turning 14 and i started skateboarding about 3 months ago. i got one of those cheep walmart special skateboards and i couldnt do anything with it. then i got these bearings and popped 'em in and they are slick and smooth. i swear this made my board a good 20 times better
These are just as good as everyone says - smooth as silk and very quick. Just to give you an idea, I get a good 40-50 feet of travel from one push using these bearings. They really are the best value out there
MSR's Pocket Rocket is a great little cooker.  Best for going light and fast. Perfect as a shared stove among two people, and even better for simple boiling or melting snow for drinking water. I would suggest this stove for use with a maximum pot capacity of two liters, more than this and it becomes a little unstable.If your menu is simple and you live on instant meals that require only boiling water this is the stove for you. Because this is a stove designed for the minimalist, it is tiny and has a very concentrated hot spot, so if you are a backcountry gourmet and want to cook pancakes and eggs you might be better off with a stove that has a larger flame spread.  Again, great for boiling water and melting snow, but not for actual cooking
i just bought this knive and iam very pleased i bought itbecause of the tool it has like the screw driver instead of cork screw and stuff like that not to big not too small just right!..
I looked at many different variations of Swiss Army Knife before I decided on this one.  I couldn't be happier!  This has an excellent variety of tools for everyday jobs (the screwdriver heads, the small blade, the scissors), and it's great for outdoor use at picnics, camping, or canoeing (the saw blade, the large knife, the toothpick).  There are still a few tools I haven't used, but overall, this is one of the best mixes of tools for the money
Great for the price paid. Kid loves this Sqarepants products
Short review:  This combo is an exceptional deal.  For the price you get three callaway balls and a swiss army golf tool.  Alone the swiss army tool is over $30-35 bucks
Any bag that doesnt have a stand will not be perfectly stable without movement.  Just the way it is.  So if you think you can by pass this point, than forget it.  But if your looking for a bag with a little more freedom to move because of space or living arrangements than you will be happy with this one but you got to remember its freestand.  The biggest debate is water or sand?  does it really make a difference?  The best tip I can give is not matter of which one but what's under the bag that helps the most from keeping it sliding on the floor when in use.When considering water or sand.... water is easier to empty out than sand but sand doesnt evaporate or get moldy.   If you have purchased this bag and your not happy because it is freestand, than forget the freedom of movement and fill the base with cement, there's an answer for everythin
My thoughts on this bag have been pretty well covered by other reviewers.  This is a great backpack with LOTS of storage space and the shoulder straps are much more comfortable than my L.L. Bean.  I recommend this bag
These clubs are great for a starter.  The best part is the price.  I wasn't sure if I would really like playing so I didn't want to go out and spend a fortune.  I found these clubs in the store and they were well over $100, so I went with Amazon and got free shipping.  The clubs arrived much sooner than expected and I paid a lot less!  I am very happy with my purchase
Do you even know what you are talking about?  I may be a kid but i have been airsofting for 5 years now.  350 fps is nothin.  My ak47 airsoft gun goes over 410.  Next time please know what you are talking about before you give a bad review
Typical Aegs shoot 280-310 and most fields that are moderated have a 350 fps limit so 400 fps aegs is great if u wanna play by yourself or in a non official place.....i also sure hope that a sniper can shoot 500 being they are normally single shot.....theyre not in the same categlory so your not comparing apples and apples.... this is a very nice gun....it is expensive for the parts included and the functionality...this gun is defidently not a beginner gun so i only reccomend it for people who have owned 2 or more aegs previously (AEG-TM ICS ,CA, AIM M4,G,G,Ect...
Another reviewer said: I think this product needs a few improvements, but in all it is a strong value proposition. Here's what I would improve if I were in charge: 1. A higher resolution screen so that the GUI could present more information. 2. Macintosh compatibility. 3. The PC cable should be included. As it stands, the cable and PC software costs nearly as much as the device itself. I say: As far as the higher resolution goes, I wouldn't want the print to be any smaller, especially if you have to deal with direct sunlight otherwise you would be hard pressed to see the readout. Concerning issue 2  3 I have no comment because I did not purchase the software. However concerning the unit itself, I have noted the following improvements which will allow me to grade this product 5 stars. Noted suggestions for modification to the eCaddy. 1. The clip should remain, however the eCaddy should be attached to the clip via a strong pull cord. This will allow quick and easy interaction to the eCaddy. (I have to suck in my gut to work the eCaddy while it is on my belt.) 2. The order of the "Hole/Par/Handi" buttons should be switched to "Handi/Par/Hole". Again, this will allow for quick and easy interaction to the eCaddy due to the respective position of the "Player" buttons. 3. A thin plastic slot simular to the "Player Name Slot" should be added to the back of the eCaddy so the user can insert a card with the abbreviate names of selective Golf courses. It is very difficult to remember the name of #1, #2 ~ #10. 4 THIS IS A BIG PLUS AND SHOULD BE A MAJOR CONSIDERATION: The players default score should automatically be set to the value of par for the hole. This will certainly please the user of the eCaddy. Currently, I will preset the values before we tee off because I know No One will get a "Hole in One" on a Par 5 hole. It is very unlikely that they will get a "Hole in One" on a Par 4 hole and it is rare to get a "Hole in One" on a Par 3 hole. This way it is possible to not have to be as busy with the eCaddy for many holes. Before this product came along, I had created a spreadsheet that I uploaded to my Palm Pilot which worked well but was very difficult to read in the sunlight and tedious to use the pen to keep track of the scores while keeping up with the pace of play. As far as the price is concerned, I feel it's about right if you were able to purchase the unit locally. Depending on who you purchase it from, after shipping and taxes you may spend close to $60. I would feel very comfortable spending $50 tops for this product. Nonetheless, the eCaddy was a definite blessing. Mike Taylor 
Just the perfect cap!. It fits like no other swimming cap. It won't pull you hair when removing it, neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning. Very resistant material, and a great finish. Awesome colors!
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law, but after he opened it, we all tried it on. I have very fragile, long hair and normally swim caps rip the hair out when I'm trying to put the swim cap on or take it off. This one came on and off so easily, without any hair-pulling
I'm on my 5th cap now I think.  Silicone is great and lasts forever.  Unlike rubber (which can snag hair) and latex (which some people are allergic to) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair, has a glossy finish so it looks great and doesn't lose elasticity. I have a some advice if you want to try this product that I've learned overt the years:1. Always rinse and hang dry.  I've left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect, it develops black spots. I don't know if it's mold, it doesn't wash off...and you'll have to buy a new cap if you don't like the spotted look.2. Pull it on gently.  I've ripped one when I was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it. It's not cloth so you have to be careful. This goes for latex and rubber, too.3. Wet your hair first.  If your hair is dry when you put it on, you will trap air under the cap.  And since it's not a permeable material, the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside.  4. Pick a fun color.  That's it.  Have a great swim
If you can stick to a workout routine, this home gym is perfect for you.  After a bit of assembly, you'll be able to do all your exercises at home
This is something that I have wanted for a very long time.  When I first starting seeing the Bowflex on those terrible TV Infomercials, I thought, "Wow, what a piece of garbage."  Later on, while serving in the US Air Force over seas, my squadron had managed to tactically acquire one.  Along with the rest of our daily regiment of physical training, a few of us would spend half an hour or so each on this odd looking apparatus.  It quickly became obvious that this was, in fact, not a piece of garbage.  Just as the few of us using it were showing some impressive results and starting to convince the rest of the squadron of its worth, we were deployed to various points of interest throughout the Middle East.  When we returned, the Bowflex was gone and we were all very upset about it.It has been a few years now, and I have since left the service.  I sent my body into a sort of accelerated atrophy alongside a bit too much of partying, to include too much drinking and too much eating.  I recently re-started some of my training, but I could only describe my progress as slow.  Then I came back to the Bowflex, found a good price for it on Amazon, and went for it.It takes a while to set up, so unless you are patient and fairly adept to the use of Lego's, I would suggest that you not expect to use it the day you get it.  If you do, as I did, I would suggest that you start out slow, as I did not.  I went with one of my old routines, which pretty much kicked my back side for about three days (and after only one workout).  The machine comes with a variety of assembly, workout, diet, and overall health aids.  Keep in mind that the weight loss guarantee only counts if you follow their workouts and diet plans closely.Now for the only part that matters.  Here it is:  It works.  Now here's the disclaimer:  It only works if you work.  Just like any other machine, weight set, pair of running shoes, etc. this machine is nothing unless you routinely use it for a workout.  If you already have a few machines sitting around you house that have, say, clothes drying on them, then this is not for you.  Don't spend the money on this if you can't stick to a routine.  Just buy a nice TV and sound system.  If you can stick to a routine, this is perfect.  If you want it to work a bit better, add a little cross training, such as running or swimming
The Bowflex is a replacement for one of the older models(original, by Schwinn)that my husband has used consistently for 12 years. It came in one huge box, and took the two of us half a day to put together. The directions and diagrams were pretty clear. One piece was broken, but they sent out a new one within the week and it is now complete. They have changed the power-rod holder, so we can't salvage most of the old ones. My husband did figure out a way to position two 50-lb rods into the new slots so he could use more resistance. It is not as compact as the older model, but it does fold up somewhat. Overall, he is very pleased with this purchase-- we paid less for this one through Amazon than we did in 1995
Great deal, Great price, Free delivery. You can't beat that. I use it every day, and have lost 30 pounds
Combining the simple, easy workout with the eating plan, my body changed, what seemed like, instantly. I HIGHLY recommend this. I"m on week 5 and have already dropped two pants sizes
I got this a few years back, and it is a very important member of our household still! My wrist was smashed in an auto accident many years ago and i no longer have the ability to hold free weight above my neck... the possibilities are atrocious. With the bowflex if i let go for any reason the potential catastrophe is avoided.There is no stress or strain except for the muscle group you are trying to focus upon. Well made, well designed, and very well built. Like our Dyson vacuum, this is a quality product utilizing quality engineering. It may be perfect for the elderly or female/male non bodybuilder athlete because of it's non need for a spotter and the ease of changing resistance!I am happy with my build, i don't want to be bodybuilder, if you do this may not be the correct machine for you... like it is for me at 43!that is my opinion, and like all the others... i'm sticking to it!thank you for your tim
Gloves are toasty...perform as expected, and are a sweet luxury after a long, cold day on the slopes; HOWEVER, the D-SIZED batteries (1 per glove) are considerably more bulky than what I expected.  Most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 AA batteries...but no, just one, bit fat chicken-roastin' D-sized battery.  Good product, but consider whether wearing the big ol' D's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves, or whether you'll barely notice, being bundled-up and bulkified anyway.  May also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it's really nippy out.
If you notice that when an item is that cheap on ebay that the shipping charge is always Huge to more then make up for the difference. Yes it is "cheaply made and not designed to last", but so are all similar products, so it is at least par for the course in that regard. Just trying to even out the review, I didn't think the other review was fair
I think that the sword itself is great, the casing is cool, and the mounting wood is nice. The only things I didn't like was that the keychain, Greiver, fell off once I took it out of the box.I also wish there were instructions for installing the mounting wood to the wall and gunblade.Otherwise, I think that I got an amazing deal
To keep the active mom going when baby arrives. No need to change your routine just because baby is here, pass along the healthy habit
they do not squeeze my ears and head and the diopters finally let me see well
The display is pretty much perfect, but as a display it is supposed to keep balls facing forward.  A litte bump inside holders allow balls to move
I like this whistle's slim design.  I wear it when shopping in rough areas.  If I am apprehended, I intend to use the whistle to draw attention to me and the assailant.  This whistle is much louder than my voice, and carries well across other sounds. 
If you camp, hike or ski then this is a great whistle to use. Pealess means the cold will not matter and it will blow no matter what the weather.High pitched and piercin
If you aren't prepared to use the Swing Setter a couple of times a week for ca. 5-10 minutes each time, you probably won't get the benefit it has to offer.  The CD and literature do a very good job of helping you to define your training regimen to which you need to add only the discipline to execute it on a regular basis.  The effects it has had on me are as follows:  a) despite my impression that my grip was solid, it forced me to assume a stronger, more compact grip that has helped me with my tendency to fade the ball; b) it has helped me to revert to being more of a hitter than a swinger (which I used to be when I was playing better) by forcing me to increase the speed of my swing (especially the backswing) and to delay release thus stopping my tendency to "cast".  The quality of construction is excellent; I can't imagine wearing it out although, I see that the magnets can lose strength over time.  My main problem has been with a looping swing - inside to outside.  So far, the Swing Setter does not seem to address this problem; I can still loop and have the magnets release at the desired time.  I would think some of the other "hinged" swing trainers would be a better help with this problem.  I do recommend the Swing Setter if for no other reason that if you have the discipline, it will serve as a conditioning device to use during the off-season.  Good luck
This is probably the most complete training aid that covers set up, swing plane, grip and tempo. However i still need video and PGA pro to correct my swing. Here is the fault that i found: i can snap the lower ball with flipping my left hand and coming steep on downswing. This is not a cure for all but it helps.The other disadvantage is the magnetic force in the balls diminishes fast
I'm a 13 handicap and I've never bought a swing trainer before, but I saw the infomercial and thought it was worth a try. It arrived yesterday and I went through the warm-up and practice. First, the grip felt very uncomfortable. Over the years I had settled into a very comfortable and very incorrect grip. This device corrected it immediately, although I didn't know it at the time. After going through the routine described in the directions I went out to the backyard and hit wiffle balls. My grip still felt funny, but my tempo, swing path and release had improved 100% in just a few minutes. This morning I went to the driving range. The improvement was dramatic. My iron shots were longer and straighter, but that uncomfortable grip caused some stray shots with my driver. After about ten driver swings I got the hang of it... and... WOW! There's a screen out at 250 yards. On a good shot I usually hit it on one bounce. Today, I was hitting the screen 15 to 20 feet up off the ground.Thanks David. I can't wait to get out on the course tomorrow
I am an avid golfer since the age of 18 and over the years, I have tried all the gizmos to get rid of my shots that drift to the right (or slice under pressure).  I have tried the Medicus, and still slice and other gizmos (swing jacket....junk) to no avail.  The swing setter worked for me.  It showed me a flaw in my grip (by the way, this flaw was not noted by several instructors and others I routinely play with) and also stressed cocking of the wrists to help get on plane.  I tried it and my shots immediately straightend out and now go straight or slightly left (still some over the top) but getting better every day.  I recommend combining this with the Swing Rite for a powerful swing.  You will still have to work with it a few times per week but it can be swung in the garage or back yard so you don't look like a goof on the range.  Give it a try, it is cheaper than most lessons and certainly helped me.  Good Golfing
This was another gift for my grandson's 1st birthday - he loves music, and is fascinated with the buttons on each side of the cube and enjoys pushing them - I'm not so sure he understands that he's adding instuments when he pushes each button, but as it lights up and the cube makes music, he totally enjoys the experience..
Doesn't look like the typical lunch bag that a child would carry and does a great job of keepin cold food cold, even without ice
The Eureka kids 30'grasshopper is an awesome sleeping bag, and a great value. We have two girls ages 6 and 8 who we purchased the sleeping bags for. On an week long camping trip in early spring twice the temperature dipped into the thirtys, and once into the low thirtys. Our girls stayed toasty warm and comfortable in their grashopper mummy bags. These bags also pack well, and have a good zipper. For the money these bags simply can't be beat.   
There were a few minor imperfections, but i'm overall happy with this sword.  The attention to detail and replication of Cloud's weapon are commendable
 	The sword itself is awesome to behold. Though the guard was only minorly spot welded and is loose from just a few minutes of play. No, I didn't hit anything. Blade is heavy, would look good if it were not scratched so bad. Can be polished up. If you know people to repair this, I suggest you do so. Cool sword, Chinese craftsmanship. Should you buy it? Hell yeah
 I'm very happy with the craftsmanship of the swoard and the delivery service. The exactness of the finish and,the wrap was done with every bit of care as a swoard made of metal. My son was also very happy with the workmanship and quality when he opened it on Christmas. Thanks everyone,G. Hanso
With a job that is extremely sedentary, 3 days sitting all day at a desk, 2 days putting on 220 miles or more sitting in a car, this has been a  most welcome purchase. 5 to 10 minutes on this each day, has greatly relieved my low back discomfortto the point where I'm able to continue this heavy work schedule, in relativecomfort.If compressed discs are your problem, you've got to try this, after first checking with your physician
I looked at several inversion tables before deciding on my Life Gear and have no regrets in buying it. I am 6'2" and weigh 220 lbs. and it performs beautifully for me. It is well built and the memory foam makes it comfortable to lay on. It was easy to assemble and took only a short time before I was using it.     I have found that just a few minutes will relax me and has helped my arthritis too.  I no longer have pain in my neck or between my shoulders. I would strongly urge people who have had back surgery to consult with their doctor before using any inversion table because they do stretch your back
This item in the green was on backorder which I didn't know when I ordered it. The seller offered to ship out a different color in this style but I really wanted the green and it was well worth the wait. Has scissors, tweezers, two blades (one has a file on it) and a toothpick. There's an attached ring for easy attachment to a key ring. The edelweiss flower design is clear and graphic - very pretty
It's actually called a tent organizer and it works fantastic.  Just hang it from any tent pole and fill it up with whatever you don't want on the ground - toilet kit, socks, towels, etc.  What a great idea
With the entire market for rocker and wobble boards so overpriced for what you get, it's nice to see that you can get a quality product without paying 50%+ more.  Solidly built of high strength plastic/resin and rubber, I find this board much stronger and more comfortable than the wood ones.  I even told my chiropractor that the Thera-Band was better than what he had in his office that his supplier wanted to charge me $75 for.  It even comes with a nice brochure outlining the various exercises you can do with the board
I love this thing.  It was easy to assemble, everything just screws on and it even comes with a little needle pump!  Mine doesnt stay very well after you stop punching it or break the rythm. If you stick to the same rythm it doesnt pop off.  The suction cup holds very well but the back and forth motion causes one side to creep up slightly, and it therefore loses its suction.  I'd by it again in a second, despite this.  Would probably hold together if i put some tape around it like someone else suggested, but its not really a big problem for me.  People come to my desk and love it.  Greatest office accessory evAr
Great way to get rid of stress in the office.  Suction cup bottom works extremely well. 
The previous reviewer provided a lot of good information about this DVD. I thought I would add a few additional comments. First, you get a lot of bang for your buck with these $50 Cathe DVDs - they are definately worth the money. This DVD has 3 full workouts - Boot Camp, Muscle Endurance and a Combo (of the 2). There are also a number of other options on the DVD menu.  I workout regularly with a variety of videos/DVDs but I'm not that motivated when it comes to doing resitance training on my own. There is some light barbell work on sevaral of the Firm Cross Training videos but my barbells were mostly collecting dust. I found Cathe's DVDs when searching on Amazon. When I saw the description for this DVD it sounded like the perfect fit for the equipment I have but the price was really challenging. I decided to take a chance and go for it. Needless to say, I was very impressed and I even ordered another $50 Cathe DVD. If you have the equipment (barbells, dumb-bells, a High Step/Firm step and maybe even a medicine ball) and you enjoy an hour of resistance training, I would highly recommend this DVD. It's challenging for an experienced exerciser but it can easily be modified to to fit any other experience level. There is some intense ab work on this DVD too. If you don't have one, you might want to purchase the "Heavy Resistance TheraBand Exercise Band" for $7.49 through Amazon when you order this DVD. Cathe uses this also and the standard resistance tubing/bands aren't a good subsitute.Although there is no price difference between Amazon and Cathe's website, when ordering through Amazon, the Cathe DVDs/Videos are shipped Priority Mail. On Cathe's website USPS is not an option so they won't ship to a PO Box. If you live outside the continental US their only shipping options are 1 or 2 day air so Amazon is a significant savings on the shipping if you live in Hawaii.  
Arrived promptly. Is exactly what I hoped for. Was unable to find this size and wt ball in any retail outlet.
Its foam! 7 bucks for shipping!  Nice product but will shop around for another seller next time for sure
A well balanced ultimate frisbee with a small battery case. The radial glowing lines and the light center result in an elegant glowing pattern in the dark. Very beautiful. Could be brighter if you want to play in a typical city park.
This inflatable kayak is functional and easy to transport given it's light wheight. Once inflated, it's easy to carry with just one arm when empty. It also has a very sturdy feel once it's completely inflated (I would recommend an electric pump that you can plug into your car battery charger).With both seats in the kayak, there is suffient room and storage space for two adults and gear. I  have been using this kayak mostly for fishing with my four-year-old son on small lakes. We generally carry two fishing rods, gear box, bottled water, and other related items, along with a dry bag. Even with all this "stuff" in the boat there is plenty of room inside, and with the seats in place I have plenty of support and elbow room for paddling.I haven't yet taken this kayak on down a creek or river so I'm not able to comment on its use in that scenario
This inflatable kayak is a hoot! I bought one yesterday and did about 12 miles on the Truckee River through Reno in it with my teenage son. (Yes, I am incredibly stiff and sore, and he's raring to go again.)First of all realize that this does not handle like a hardbody kayak. Close, but not quite. It is just a pointy rubber raft, after all. It likes to go down the river sideways or backwards, depending upon where the heaviest bottom sits. But, it can be easily paddled by one or two persons to float just like the real thing.About thirty years ago I used to have a fiberglass kayak and went down many rivers here in the western USA. I've worn wool long underwear under a wetsuit to stay warm and have almost lost camera gear and food in rollovers. I kinda know how to handle a kayak.This Sevylor should not be taken through anything greater than a 4, depending upon the skill of the paddler. It rides like a typical rubber raft through crests and holes. It might be fun to play with solo in standing waves, but it would be hard to brace into because there are no foot/heel rests. There is no way to stay in it in a rollover. You'll just get dumped out.On the practical side, it only weighs about 23 pounds, can be had for around $140, inflates easily and quickly with a plunger air pump (sold separately), is easily portaged around the rough water, has a very shallow draft, is made from some very tough PVC, is comfortable to sit in for several hours, is easy to dump water out of, cleans off quickly with just a hose, and deflates in a heartbeat to be folded back into the size of a medium suitcase. For us, it is perfect - affordable, handy in the waters we frequent, easy to inflate/deflate/store.I'm thinking of getting another one so that he can have his own, and so that I won't get quite as splashed-on from his flailing paddling. He can also tow old mom on the wide slow parts.Sue :)
This item is well made.  The tube is beefy and the handles are sturdy.  The included exercise booklets are lame. They have dated black and white photos showing disinterested people doing lack luster exercises. 
These are exactly what they are advertised to be. I thoroughly enjoy using them
Wow! I was really pleased with my purchase. I've never owned a heavy bag before so I didn't know what to expect. I just started martial arts so I wanted a bag to practice on, but I didn't have a lot of money to spend. This purchase was not only well within my price range, but the bag is high quality and includes a speed bag with gloves! The gloves aren't very padded, a boxer friend of mine told me the gloves included were really for use on the speed bag. The heavy bag comes filled and is very solid, the chain is heavy duty, and the connections for the chain on the bag are well attached with double stitching. I was a little uncertain about just what the Nevatear material was, now I know. My description would be a heavy duty nylon with a slight rubberized feeling. In my opinion better than the abrasive canvas bags, yet not as soft to the touch as a leather bag. Two other purchases I would recommend are a good set of padded gloves for use on the heavy bag (I purchased some padded grappling gloves) and for the speed bag you will need two things: (1) a swivel attachement (I bought the Everlast plastic ball swivel for about $15 at a local Academy Sports Store) and (2)you will need to make or purchase a backboard and stand or wall attachment (I made mine from 2 x 6's and 3/4" MDF). All in all, a GREAT purchase! I couldn't be happier
This kit also includes a speed bag!! The item description never mentions that.  Which is awesome, but I already ordered one because I thought this didn't have it.  However it is a small speed bag so keep that in mind.  The bag gloves are very "budget" just like they state. So I doubt they will last long.  The heavy bag is fully packed, so the box is about 70lbs.  Other than that this is an exceptionally good value esp. with the free shipping
This product is fabulous for peace of mind. The kit is comprehensive enough to give security for 72 hours.  I bought some for my sisters and they love them too.  As far as 72 hour kits go, this is a lot of bang for your buck
I purchased these for my parents who are both in their 80's in order to bring some resistance training into their exercise programs.  My Dad takes 2 mile walks and manages the snow blower in the winter.  My mother does some treadmill walking.  They really enjoy using these bands and I think it is benefiting them.  They are simple to use and effective as if you work hard enough you can definitely feel it
 this gun is a good gun after the first charge. the problems are: the clip jamms and u need to get a screw driver, the laserr is in accurate. thats all thats worrng. good things are: after the first charge its powerfull and accurate. Its nice and ajdustable for anyones fit. Its worth i would think atleast 50 bucks. Its just a good gun, nothing special
This gun is really cool! It has decent aim, great fire power, and the charge lasts a long time. The only thing i find a little usettling is the fact that the clip only holds about 20 bb's at a time, but hey, you can't have everything. Anyways, great buy
I am use to doing abs work and pilates on the carpet, but my carpeting did not have enough padding so I decided to order an exercise mat.  I a very please with my order.  I noticed the difference right away.  The cushioning it gives my lower back is awesome. 
Very nice.  Good coverage of light.  Lights can always be brighter in my opinion.  Easy installation and good battery life
This is the second Suunto Vector watch i have owned. Only because the first one was lost. The only two draw backs of this watch is battery life and my band broke twice in two years. Seems to me they could offer a much longer life battery and a band that would hold up alot better. the battery lasts about 6 months only.For the price of this watch ($230) you think tehy could do alittle better. Other than that i love the watc
I finally convinced my wife we needed to purchase a couple of these for training.  My sons and I will begin training in Kendo soon.  I have a few regular swords (not the display only variety) and are very excited with purchasing some practice swords.I understand these come highly recommended after speaking with a couple of Amazon customer
This is a excellent product for certain needs. It is unmatched for ease of transport (I can easily carry four of them at once). The only drawback is that these tables are limited in how much weight they can hold. This makes perfect sense, of course. If they were sturdier , they would be heavier. A common sense approach to usage -- place heavier objects toward the ends and the legs rather than in the middle on the hinge -- will insure safety and longevity of the product. All in all, a very good value
IT IS A GREAT FOOTBALL BUT IS HARD TO GRIP IF YOU DON'T HAVE REAL LARGE HANDS AND IS SLIPPERY
get this gun but dont even concider getting the elecric version its a huge waste of cash. there like $70 -$80 and they only get about 20 feet of range when u point it at a 45 degree angle up. yeah its that bad. but this gun shoots good
i just got this gun today and i just opened it but where is the lever or w/e u cock the gun with to shoot???? I dont wanna break the gun right away so please someone with this gun reply and tell me how to shoot it
Our family are backpacking campers.  We make a big deal out of loading our backpacks with everything we need while striving to keep them as light as possible.  I bought one My-Ti Titanium flatware set for my husband.  We all loved it so much that I ordered more for me and our son.  They are light weight, come with a link to keep them all connected, and we prefer them to the "sporks". When we aren't camping, they are in our lunch packs and/or picnic supplies. Amazon.com had them at the best price
My husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state--they wanted to share email address---no one had a pen/pencil so my husband's friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with.  Everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside.  My husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it---could not find it so I did some searching on the net and bought it for his Christmas gift---he was so excited to receive it on Christmas morning.  Thanks  
I've spent years camping with a bag of clothes half-strewn around my tent, so a new tent led me to check this out to see if I can stay organized.The closet comes in its own thin carrying case.  It looks complicated at first opening, but it's easy to insert the fiberglass rods, zip down the corners, adjust the Velcro seams, and BOOM! you've got a very sturdy and roomy set of shelves for socks, shorts, t-shirts, towels, and medication.  There's a zip-down mesh cover to keep things out of your stuff yet keep it ventilated, and it rolls up out of the way.  Pockets on the sides for pop/beer cans, wallet, and the like are very handy, and hooks for keys on both sides let you keep things where you can find them easily.  There's even a pocket on the back that stores magazines and maps.  But the value is in keeping things organized, OFF the tent floor, where you can see that stuff without having to paw through a duffelbag and toss things all over your tent.  I'm happy to have found this neat piece of tent furniture
It fits a suprisingly large amount of stuff. I use it every week to take drinks to sport events. It's easy to pack and carry on your back and much easier than those cumbersome boxes
I live on a large college campus and have had my bikes stolen before, but with this lock I haven't had anyone even try to steal it.  It's not as heavy as I thought it would be (a plus) and it is pretty small so it can fit in just about any larger pocket.  It feels solid and looks strong too.  I would definitely buy this lock again if ever need be
These are definatly very accurate. The seem is barely visable. In pistols these dont really crack, but in my aeg rifle, which is 360FPS, these crack at close distance. But keep in mind these are light .12g's and .20g's a rerecommended for aeg's.4 out of 5, nice polished accurate bb's
This is a great trainer to start with, some people complain that it doesn't have enough resistance. But it does for me!I have had no problems with this trainer or any of my Cycle Ops products
Most "replica" type weapons in this price range are just made to sit pretty on a shelf or wall, not these. Made out a single piece of stainless steel, these are very solid knives. As the previous reviewers stated, these do come very dull, but a file, a sharpener and a couple of hours can fix that. Once sharpened these knives are very useable
I would like to note I am NOT a fan of the Riddick movie, Though A blade this unique tends to get your attention reguardless! This knife is very practical, It's a solid piece of metal all around. I own a pair of these and used them on a grounded, wooden post for hours! Yet after my use they shown no sign of bends, Chips or dents! They shipped to me dull, But hey I don't mind sharpening them myself. A word of caution, You can seriously injure someone with these! Their odd form makes them very deadly if sharpened as well as mine are
This product is pretty much what I expected.  The latex is a little dusty looking--not a clean crisp red at all.  However, it gets the job done for those pilates exercises
I had gotten my wife a new bike and needed to find a helmet for her above-average sized cranium. The Bell Triton was it. It fit perfectly the first time she put it on and adjusted it. I would recommend it for anyone with a good-sized head on their shoulders
I had a hard time looking for a larger helmet that would fit me, i even tried using Giro Altas II  but not quite.  Good thing bell triton fit's just right. 
This is a great little camp kitchen, just the right size without taking up a lot of room at the camp site. I have another camp kitchen bought from a well known outdoor supplier but it's massive in size and more suited for extended stays, the Guide Gear Camp Kitchen is perfect for weekend camping and shorter stays. It's compact both set up and in it's carrying bag, it'll take up hardly any space while traveling. Perfect size for a camp stove on the top table with a smaller propane or charcoal grill on the side table. The hanging pantry is strong and rugged with plenty of room to stock food, paper supplies, etc. This is a well thought out and designed kitchen and while compact has everything you'd need to enjoy the great outdoors. I highly recommend it...Buy it, try it.... You won't be dissapointed
I haven't used this camping, but I set it up in my living room as soon as I got it in the mail and it took about 2 minutes.  It looks great and I can't wait to try it out camping this summer with my family of five!!  I know exactly where I am going to put all of my camping dining essentials on this kitchen. 
It's always satisfying to see that a determined manufacturer can significantly improve even the simplest of devices. It's a pleasure to hold and use this bottle.I like:* Not having to tip your head up to drink, since the mouthpiece is connected to a straw inside that goes to the bottom - I've never seen this design before* Easy to flip open with one hand, yet you don't have to pull hard with your teeth like in standard designs* Absense of taste compared to plastic bottlesI don't like:* Diameter of the bottle is too wide to fit standard cage all the way. It takes a lot of force to push it in about 2/3 of the way and it doesn't go further. It hasn't flown out during riding yet, but I am looking for a wider cage now (not easy to find). Why not make it standard diameter for bike cages
 I'm a small person at 5'2", so this 24" Denali is perfect for me. I bought the 26" one and liked it, but it was too big, so gave that one to my husband.  The bike was easy to assemble, no problems with delivery, very quickly. I like the way the Denali shifting system so u can see what geer your in similar to my mountain bike. It Shifts smoothly rides very nice, this is my first road bike and am very pleased with it!
This is the best knife sharpening system I have ever owned. The kit has 2 medium sharpening rods, 2 fine sharpening rods, a booklet, a VCR instruction tape, the plastic storage case which doubles as the base.I can easily keep my Spyderco Delica knife razor sharp; also my Wusthof kitchen knives. (Even the serrated knives!) This kit takes all the guesswork out of keeping the right angle to sharpen your knives
As a hobbyist woodworker who works primarily with hand tools, I've had to learn how to put a razor edge on things like plane blades and chisels.  While I've managed to master that skill (can shave hair off my arm with these tools), putting a sharp edge on my kitchen knives has been a nightmare.  I've tried numerous methods, none of which has worked well.About a year ago, I puchased the Spyderco sharpening kit.  Read the manual, watched the DVD, put my kitchen knives to it, and......ended up with pretty dull knives.  Frustrated, I put this kit in a kitchen drawer.Fast-forward to last week.  The kitchen knives are dull again, and none of my sharpening systems work on the knives.  So, I pulled out the Spyderco again and gave it another try.  This time, I tried sharpening my serrated bread knife.  After just a few strokes, it was good as new.  So, I tried it on the straight knives again, but only got a modest increase in sharpness.  Now convinced that some of my kitchen knives are made from inferior stainless steel, I tried sharpening my Swiss Army Knife.  Again, after a few stokes on the Sharpmaker, I had a wicked sharp knife.I was down in the workshop today, sharping my plane blades and chisels.  The last plane blade to sharpen was for a scrub plane...the blade on these is very convex, so sharping it is always a challenge.  Fortunately, it does not need to be super sharp, and never has been.  The Sharpmaker was sitting out, so I said "what the heck", and gave the scrub plane's blade a few freehand strokes on the Sharpmaker...no sharpening jig to hold the blade like I normally use.  For fun, I tried to shave hair off my arms....AND IT WORKED!  I couldn't believe it...this Sharpmaker makes sharpening TOO easy!It's American-made, very well thought-out, and works amazingly well when your blades aren't made of junk steel.  What more could you ask for?  
this is the best and easiest knife sharpener ever. you can sharpen anyting with it...but I use it mostly for knifes. any knife, serated, stainless, it works great on filet knives. it is quick and easy. I believe the brown stones are the key. they make getting a bad knife easy to sharpen. one you might think about taking to a grinding wheel , but in a few minutes the damn thing will be sharp enough to cut hair. best of all the knife will hold an edge after sharpened. I bought one of these 25 years ago. I still have it and it still works great. I had to buy one for the motor home. since I don't sharpen the knives in there before we go.and once you have sharp knives you don't go back. I love this sharpener. mostly because my wife uses it too. we always have sharp knives. thanks for a great product!!  thanks Ti
Works well. Much faster than the "cheap" metal swivel that has only the hook. If you don't have a wealth of speed-bag experience, be prepared to "re-learn" when you upgrade to this swivel
Great swivel action, tough construction, easy to remove for adding air to your speed bag.  Worth the price
the Jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient.  It doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact.  Getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter.  this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them.  I had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said " I never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal "
This review is for Nike T-90 Club Team (32 panels)I bought this ball for less than $15 thinking I couldn't go wrong. I hadn't used Nike balls before, so I didn't know what to expect. It turns out that this ball flies better, is softer, is rounder, and is better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls. Great practice ball, and pick-up game ball. I would have no problem using it in a small club match either. As far as my $30 adidas balls? Not a chance.5 Stars based on performance vs. price. I hope you get as good a deal as I did (through Eastbay Athletics)
I recently recieved this gift as a birthday present.  The batteries that it came with had a little juice in them already, and since the directions said to discharge them completely before charging for the first time, I fired off a few dry rounds and a few BB's.  The blowback is quite impressive; I find myself shooting dry rounds just to see that nice blowback action.  The batteries are charged via putting them in the gun and attaching the charger to the pistol butt - so far, I've had no problems.  The gun looks and feels authentic.  I have not tried the flashlight during games just yet, though it seems very powerful (after shining it in my eyes accidentaly :p).  The main problem I had was with the magazine.  To get it out of the gun, you must pull it out; there is no magazine release button.  This wasn't too much of a problem for me, just new.  However, when I was loading the BB's into the magazine NORMALLY, the two halves of it popped open, sending the spring and BB's flying.  I put it back together and taped the sides together as reinforcement, and it works fine now.  Recommended for all not-so-hardcore players.
This is a very realistic pistol.  The blow back makes it look almost exactly like the real thing.  It's range isn't as far as rifles, but it still shoots across the yard.  When you got shot with them from 10 yards away, they still hurt a little.  One time, my dad, brother and I were battling in the front yard, and a lady in her car slowed down to see what we were doing
We just got this bag today for our son.  We got the short version of this bag, but I don't see that version on Amazon anymore.  The outside is a very nice rip-stop nylon material and soft and cuddly, and the zipper is very smooth.  The inside is a little scratchy, but I am sure it will be better after a washing.  The drawstring around the hood pulls nice and tight to keep out the air.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the color.  The picture on Amazon, and on the box it came in, is turquiose.  The bag is definitely NOT turquiose!  It is a darker blue - closer to navy - color.  And the yellow is more of a mustard color, not a bright yellow, and the inside is dark gray.  But my son likes it anyhow, and of course it doesn't affect the quality of the bag.  I like the fact that the hood turns inside out, too
I purchased three of these units to mount in a utility trailer.  They did a great job on the trip of holding our bikes rock steady.   Very easy to get the bikes in and out of.  Great product
This is a quite good item.  I looked at a number or similar items on amazon and this one seemed caught my eye.  It certainly does make drinking from a nalgene or similar (mine is actually from a different maker, but of the same style) much easier.  My only qualms are that it is slightly expensive for a simple piece of plastic.  Also, it is a little irritating to have to take it out and replace it everytime you want to refill the bottle.  You can fill over it I suppose, but it reduces the flow rate so that you have to fill much more carefully and slowly which reduces one of the advantages of having a large mouth bottle.  I also kind of wish that there was an easier way to access the lip of the bottle than having to unscrew and rescrew the top each time, but that is a general issue with the bottles, not this lid.  But overall, a very useful purchase
This is a great skateboard ramp for kids who are really into skateboarding. If space is an issue, this is a great product. It is very sturdy for any type of skateboarding tricks. I would recommend having an adult present at all times when folding the ramp because it is very heavy. The wheels on the side make it very portable. My boys are 13 and 11 and they LOVE it
I was overall very happy with the performance of this tent for the price aournd $100.  It recently survived well while being used for over a week of backpacking in Denali National Park in Alaska.  The  weight is slightly more than typical backpacking tents, but the price and features make up for that.  It survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night with no damage.  The two doors and size are decent for 6 foot people without being too cozy.  The vestibules are very handy for storing your boots.  On colder nights it did get a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the tent though.  Overall a good purchase. 
Finger tips a bit too long... not a problem just turned them down, very comfortable, relieves stress on fingertips and palm... nice design and fit.  Hard to beat for this price
After reviewing some of the other devices to hold the iPod Mini in place while exercising, selected the Armband Carrier. It more than adequately fills the bill of what I was looking for. Occassionally, you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm, but it holds the iPod firmly in place. It can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device. If you sweat a great deal while you exercise, I would advise removing the iPod from the holder after you complete your routine. Would recommend it to anyone who asks
does this gun use 6mm or .12 and if i do use .12s will it damage the firing mechanisim
I actually bought this for my husband. He loves it, it  has a lot of great features. The only thing that we found was that you had to really wet the device in order to get it to read the heartrate.
This case was ordered to hold some medical equipment that must travel with me on my about two-weeks-per-month business travel.  The good part is that this case will probably survive falling into a black hole.  The bad part is that it takes up half my carry-on suitcase.  But that's what you pay to have protection for expensive equipment
We use these socks snowmobiling in -20F temperatures and they keep your toes from getting numb when you're are outdoors for a long stretch.  Note the amt of head from the batteries is very small, but it's enough to keep your toes from numbing out on the trails.The don't get "hot", and they are not made to keep your feet warm inside.  The amount of heat they produce is not enought to notice in a heated home or office.Battery life on high is about 10 hours - maybe 12 hours on low setting.l
This product does what it claims it will do.  Put in the time and effort - you'll feel great! Of course, I don't ever expect to look like the model on the box.  However, I feel good and I think I look a little better than when I started.  Only doing it a few weeks, but enjoying it
I have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best. The thickness (1/8 inch) is just perfect - not too thick so it's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning. What I really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip, in a word, it is comfortable. 
I bought this mat, because my gym recently began offering yoga classes, and the mats they supplied soon got pretty grody.  This mat is longer and thicker than the gym's version, looks a lot nicer, and has a good 'tacky' feel under my bare feet.  And it was cheaper than comparable mats at local stores.  It's easy to hand wash (and comes with instructions), so I can keep it clean.  Overall, it's a great yoga mat. 
We didn't know what to expect for the good price. But what a surprise this thing is built very sturdy. extremely easy to set up, maybe took 2 minutes. It is very very quiet. Extremely happy with purchase.
I was looking for a bike trainer, but did not want to spend $150 and up.  Took a chance on this one, after seeing it being sold by Nashbar and Performance.  It seems to be quite solidly constructed and holds the bike very steady and secure.  I got it set up in 5 minutes without any difficulty.  Only 3 "levels" of difficulty, but this does not seem to be much of an issue.  It is not too loud, but also not terribly quiet-- about as loud as our washing machine.  Overall, for the price (I paid $80), this trainer meets/exceeds my expectations
The clear instructions make this piece of exercise equipment easy to put together.  It's also very sturdy and offers a wide range of exercises
The first thing that I thought was "this is a lot of equipment for the money".  It comes well wrapped and is easy to assemble.  Took me about an hour.  It's relatively sturdy, although there is some minor movement of the frame when changing exercises (eg, the frame will move slightly forward when moving from leg lifts to dips).  Overall, I do not see how they make money selling it this inexpensively based on the good quality of this machine.Keep in mind, that in order to use the chin up bar, there needs to be enough clearance from the top of the machine to the ceiling, as your chin will touch the top of the machine.  Most residential ceilings are about 8 feet
Easy set up and directions and great functionality.  No problems what-so-ever picking up the wireless signal. 
If you are trying to decide between a wood or foam yoga block, I can highly recommend the foam blocks with beveled edges because they are very comfortable. When you are pressing on the blocks, they are firm enough to withstand your body weight, but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt from the pressure. Blocks tend to encourage proper form because they allow you to slowly work into poses and provide the needed support when you can't reach the floor in a pose. The lightweight blocks are easy to move from side to side and they can work as an extension of your arm. There are many ways you can use these blocks and once I started to do the Yoga Step By step workouts/yoga practice sessions, I found I really did need to buy softer yoga blocks to try some of the more advanced positions. ~The Rebecca Review 
Three things to consider in a yoga block: size, material, color.  This thing is purple = ugly.  The material is foam, and this block will still be around 1 million years after I die - for a more environmentally sound purchase try cork, for double the price, of course.  Finally, I like the size of this block, most blocks are 3x5x9, this one is 4x6x9 which means that its more stable
The shipping was very quick on this item.  It arrived in less than a week.  Points for the seller.   I just started using this item and I'm very sore from using it.  Its working wonders various chest areas.  Took me awhile to get comfortable using it. I eventualy just gave up on the work out instructions and started doing what feld most comfortable and easy on myself.
I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season.  Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such.  This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera!
Got this for my 4 year old niece's birthday, she is really into Dora so she was happy with it.  The skootskate is simple to put together, but not necessary the most durable materials.  Then again, you get what you pay for. I got this on the Friday sale for ten bucks, along with some books so that there is no shipping charge.  My niece is happy, so can't complain much about that.
GREAT ITEM BUT REALLY TOO LARGE FOR 3 YEAR OLDS. MAYBE GOOD FOR 5 OR OLDER.
pretty decent utilitarian paddle.  i think this is a better deal than all the other low end paddles out there, since shipping cost was zero
Lightweight, well made.Excellent kayak paddles.I highly recommend these
Very comfortable.  They may be just a tad too long for a shorter person. 
The Suunto bike pod is easy to install in a few minutes, and worked, as advertised, paired with the Suunto T3, Training Effects/Heart Rate monitor.  Unlike other wireless cycling computers used in the past, the Suunto bike pod does not require micro positioning on the bike and continues to send reliable signals to the Suunto T3, even in bad weather and over rough terrain. Although bike pod includes provisions for mounting the Suunto T3 on the handle bars, this configuration is not required for use.  The Suunto T3 is a wrist-worn training effects and heart rate monitor, and works fine when worn on either the left or right wrist, receiving wireless signals from the bike pod as well as the Suunto heart rate transmitter worn around the chest
I bought a flybar 800 a few months ago and its the coolest thing ever. You can jump super high on it, and the people that work for flybar are awesome. i emailed them when my ruuber tip broke, and they responded a few hours later and sent me a new one for free. 
This is one of the best pogo sticks on the  market.you can go about 6 feet high,jump off of stairs
My three sons and I saw these pogos demonstrated at the Cleveland X Games a couple years ago.  We could not beleive what we saw.  This is unlike any pogo stick you have ever seen.  For the money, it's a tremendous value, and their customer service is the best I have come across.  They also make a high(er) octane version called the Flybar 1200 which supports larger riders.  For adults (yes, adults will love this thing!)or kids this is a "must have" this Christmas.  My youngest son can't wait for their next model (Flybar 400) due in '07 I believe...An absolute, 100%, thumbs-up!  Jim Woods, Akron, Ohi
I bought this for my brother, he loved it! I was worried that it is a little big, but apparently fisherman have a lot of stuff :-)He said it was just right
I bought this bike for myself and I love it.  I got it for half the listed price.  It was originally intended as a starter to introduce myself back in to biking (at 30+yrs old) but I'm going to stick with it.  The other buyer with the bad experience must have gotten a bad bike.  The brakes are excellent and the bike itself, including shocks, are just as sturdy as my husband's expensive pro bike.  The 24inch is perfect for me, being barely five-foot-two; and doesn't seem too juvenile in stature or in color.  I highly recommend this bike
I burned my hand, but it was ok. I got to keep 3 of my fingers. They work fine, but they're a bit too hot
This is a fine product, and very adequate to meet our requirements. We received it promptly in good condition
I bought a red GE Lantern a couple of years ago. I have used it for power outages, walking my dogs morning and night during the winter, and rarely, I've even used it for camping.I haven't done any definitive studies but the battery life seems to be longer than the 16 hours GE states.  I find the light to be strong enough to read by.  During dog walks the lantern has all but been submerged in rain and it hasn't phased it.  And it's performance has not been affected by colder temperatures even down in the teens. Though I have to admit, neither the dogs, or I wanted to be out very long in weather that cold.The workmanship is very nice.  I recently looked at Coleman lanterns and they have gone to a flimsy plastic top.  The GE lantern is built very sturdily but is light enough to carry in one hand and still control a leashed dog. The only downside I've found, and I don't consider this a big issue, if the lantern is knocked hard enough, say you slip and fall down a ravine in the rain, the batteries will slip out of place somewhat and the light will either dim or go out.  It is easy to fix, just transfer both dog leashes to one hand, turn the lantern upside down, unscrew the base enough so the batteries can be settled back where they belong and tighten the base back up.I would definitely purchase another GE lantern. 
This product generatesa lot of attention. I like this one very much and looks very cool and very handy. It is very small when compared with other products in the market for a similar kind. The bright red LED is kinda OK. Ball point pen is very handy, though the quality of the tip is not very good
I started taking tennis classes at my community college a couple weeks ago. I picked up this racquet because it was cheap and light with a big head. It has performed very well and my game is good enough to play with some of the more experienced players that have $200+ racquets
I bought this for my husband last year, and it's still in good condition.  We love it.  The whole family can fit under it.  It keeps the wind out really well, due to the double layers.  It never ever turns inside out
The are pretty comfy and definitly help out your hands and wrists during workouts. Unfortunatly, the wear out pretty easily a the seams. I saw them cheaper at Hibbets after I ordered them from here. Oh well, only like a three dollar difference. I'll know next time when I get another pair in about two months
This is an excellent idea and greatly expands menu options while camping. You have to remember it is not a crock-pot though, the 6qt container is steel and not stoneware - I didn't. Therefore, a crock-pot dish that took 10hrs on low was done in 30min on low with this product, certainly this is not the product's fault but owner error. A very good product, highly recommended for campers and tailgaters
I'm currently in Iraq and I ordered this bike, although it took a while to get it (not uncommon in a package that is 90 percent medal) I was happy when finally I recieved it. I had a little trouble putting the brakes on and warped the alumimum screws that hold the brakes cables to the levers. After my small mishap I was on my way riding in 30 mins or less. I've had the bike for about three months or more and it has stood up to all sorts of terrain and weather. During the summer tempertures can reach 130 during the day and I had no issues with paint or the mechanics period. Now its the winter season and tempertures drop down to 30 and it rains often; still no major damage or issues other than a little rust on the four screws holding the handle bars in place. I've taken this bike threw rocks, dirt, asphalt, and plenty of sand. After a quick spray with the hose and wipe with a dry rag the bike is just as glossy and bold as the day I took it out of the box. Overall I am very pleased with this bike and plan to bring it back to the States with me when my tour is up
Living in Europe, my husband and I were dubious about ordering a bicycle for our daughter who lives in USA.  However, knowing the reputation of Amazon, we risked it.   Our final choice was the Women's Ranger by Schwinn.   It was assembled by a friend without any problems as the excellent manual was most comprehensive.   The bike is beautiful and we - and our daughter - are thrilled.   It is made of high quality components, yet is fairly light.   It is sturdy enough to handle the roughest city streets, which is where our daughter will be cycling.The gear shift is smooth and effortless and the brakes excellent.As a footnote, the first bike arrived with slight defects, was returned to Amazon who sent a replacement before even receiving the first bike back!   We were most impressed!   The second bike is perfect!    It looks so good too - quite important for women
 The wife and me each got a set and tried it out today. We were surprised everything was great quality and looked nice. The fins are great cut right thru the water. The snorkle is also great, kept water totaly out in waves and when diving. The mask was good/ok. You can't go wrong with this package.  Wish I would have got the other US Divers kit with the little better mask and same fins for a few bucks more.We are happy.Dan  Melissa
Bought this for my husband for Father's Day!  Delivered in no time! He loved it!  I let him do the registration etc. because he has more patience than I.It works very well.  Bought the vice like attachment too so it could go in every golf cart we use including our own.  I LOVE IT. I have trouble judging distances and this is our co-toy now!The battery went dead too soon. We called Sky Golf and they are sending a free one out posthaste. We even bought the $19.95 warranty for one year.  It's worth it! 
I have used this unit twice and have been more impressed each time.First time was a loaner from my favorite golf shop and the second was the unit that I just purchased. My reaction... WOW.  Great tool for golfers at all skill levels.  The information presented appears to be extremely accurate and is much more accurate than guessing or finding a marker and then interpolating distances.  I found the IntelliGreen feature extremely useful.  I was able to shoot at several greens unseen whereas before I would have laid up in a safe visible landing zone short of the green.  The target lists were consistent with the features I was concerned about on most holes.  If anything, I found the target list to contain too many itemsI found registration and set up a bit tedious and would like to Sky Golf make it easier.  Be sure to read the installation instructions in the manual very closely.  Your internet browser MUST be set to allow cookies from Sky Golf.  Otherwise you may spend all day and never get set up or be able to download courses.The variety of plans for course downloads is adequate, but I wish they would include at least a 1 year subscription to the basic "PAR" Sky Player course download plan with the purchase of the unit.Others have complained about quality and construction.  I don't know what their standards are, but my unit seems well constructed and of very high quality material.Bottom line, if you can afford it and you're looking for a great product to improve you knowledge of the golf courses you play... then this product is for you.
Can't beat this cabinet for the price.Pine wood makes it very light, but sturdy.Looks nice on the wall
Seems to be a good bike.  Haven't had time to ride it much yet.
This was such an unusual and unique idea. I gave it as a gift, and the person really liked it! It's different than the usual type of world series champions type posters. The artist who made this was very creative
I've been doing yoga for 7 years.  I've gone through a couple of regular sticky mats by now (I don't like how they get stretchy after a couple of years), so I decided to buy something more durable.  I love the texture of this mat -- it's very solid feeling with a good bit of stick -- and it doesn't move around at all.  It has just the right amount of cushion to it, and I use it on a hard floor.  I also bought the Lumi towel (large size), also by Manduka, to put on the mat, since my hands and feet tend to sweat by the time I get to the middle of my routine, and this can make any mat slippery.  I didn't have any trouble with the coating on the mat -- it wore off after a little bit, and I used the towel until it did.  I also didn't agree with some of the other reviews saying it was too heavy.  It's a bit heavy, but not too much to carry around all over -- I made a carry handle from a yoga strap (looped over both ends of the rolled up mat) and throw it over my shoulder
Great mat. Provides good purchase, even when getting sweaty. It is a bit short, if you are above 6ft. (like me) to do Ashtanga, but is great for Hatha Yoga
Expensive, but I use it for aerobic and occasional high impact exercises as well as yoga. Very satisfied
I have recently purchased this item.  I think that it is cheaper to by the new tube than buying patches for holes in a tube
A little caveat -- this review is actually for the exact same flooring system in the 1'x1' size tiles (which worked out better for me because they are a little more flexible in terms of configuration for a smaller space).  That said, these floor mats are really great!  I wanted to create a home gym space for doing floor aerobics  step workouts as well as pilates, yoga, weighted workouts, etc.  These fit the bill absolutely perfectly!!!  They  are stiff enough that there's no danger of ankle instability because of a too-soft surface, but they are soft enough that when you do floor work, they provide excellent cushioning.  My knees used to kill me when I would do a runner's stretch, but now I actually go "ahhhh" as I'm doing them, which is great.  Not even a smidge of discomfort.  They are also really great for absorbing the jarring of high-impact activities.  Talk about an ankle, knee, and hip saver!  The ONLY discomfort I still notice and I really think it's just me) is during floorwork when I'm on my side to do leg lifts, I have some problems in the area of the greater trochanter (bony prominence at the top of the femur).  But I am very sensitive in that area due to running a marathon recently, so again, I really think it's just me.  Anyway, I just can't say enough good things about these mats -- I highly recommend them.  Now -- to address the title of my review.....  My ONLY complaint about the mats -- and I'm echoing another recent reviewer on this -- is that when I first put them down, they slid all over the place on my hardwood floors.  Because they are not completely wall-to-wall in the configuration I had them, this was a problem.  I was able to solve the problem completely, though, by buying one of those sticky under-carpet anti-slip pads that you can get very inexpensively.  I found a yoga sticky mat placed underneath did the trick, as well.  But I would have had to put about 3 yoga sticky mats underneath to cover enough surface area to keep it from slipping.  In short, if you have hardwood floors like me (I don't know how they would perform on carpet or other surface; you'd have to see another review to check on that), I highly recommend these mats without reservation -- provided you are willing to shell out a tiny bit of extra dough to get an anti-slip pad to put underneath.  Also, if you do, be sure to get one that covers the whole area of the mat (or very close to it).  Otherwise, if you come down on a part that's not protected during a lateral move, you may find yourself sliding across the room and losing your balance.  A little expensive, but really worth the investment in my opinion.  Happy sweating to you (or whatever activities you plan to use the mats for).  :
Great flooring system. Easy to assemble and very strong.Expensive but worth it
These mats are easy to use, and pretty durable, but I find them to be too slippery.  Not enough friction.  A thin rubber surface would be much better
By wife and I bought both the men and womens model.  They were a great buy, arrived on time and were easy to assemble. They're comfortable to ride and seem to be well built.  Enjoy. 
I ultimately purchased 4 of these bikes for my beach house.  They are very reasonably priced and provide a sturdy ride.  They look like a true beach cruiser and have fenders, a feature not often found on less expensive cruiser bikes. They are easy to assemble.  They were shipped quickly and arrived safe and sound.  The ride can be a bit stiff but for the price you cannot complain
These gloves are extremely high quality. They do a great job of protecting your hands, and for most exercises, they do help your grip. The have the best wrist support of any glove I've used to date. However, as mentioned: if you have small hands, the added padding/rubber in the gloves will decrease the circumference of your grip in general. This is a problem for exercises like deadlifts, chin ups, etc. Also, the material inside is a bit like felt. When your hands are sweaty, these gloves basically adhere to your hand on the inside and it usually takes me 1-2 minutes to get them off. They may just need to be broken in more, but I've used them for 3 weeks thus far. 
I have 6 children.  4 couldn't ride bikes.  The scooters teach balance without worry about pedaling. The kids feel safer because they can hop off easier.  Now, 5 out of 6 of my children are riding bikes and the last probably will be soon.  Great toy
Bought it for daughter's Christmas gift. She loves it. Cool color. Adjustable height is useful for her short height. She is very proud with it. Bigger wheels gives a bit more stability
Purchased for a Christmas gift. The larger wheels and stronger construction was just what my son needed. He had the orignial A scooter for several years but is now a teen and was in need of a new razor with stronger construction. He was also wanting the wheely "kick" bar over the back wheel. Overall, the A3 gave him everything he needed to continue enjoying "the Razor." Kick stand would have been a nice addition to this model but no big sweat..can just be one more thing to break in my opinion.  Price on Amazon couldn't be beat. Price was by far the best from a host of on line sites I checked. Shipping was great deal and came quickly, within 3 or 4 days after ordering it just a week before Christmas! In the word of my son "Santa be very very good to me!
good product.  easy to use.  good price.  like having the neoprene cover over the metal...makes it softer to hold
for the price, not a bad piece of home gym equipment. cushion could be softer but overall it works the back  abs real good.
I am very satisfied with the Apex Chair. I used one many years ago in a gym. I looked on line and found it on Amazon.com. Apex instructions were very easy to follow. This peace of equipment is very well constructed and is very good for your lower back and abs
Perfect way to ensure you are drinking the minimum requirement of 8-8 oz. servings of water each day.  Fill it up in the morning and make sure it's empty by the time you go to bed at night! Very sturdy and best of all - NO plastic taste to your water! 
We bought this stroller not only for jogging but also to use at places like Disneyland.  The swivel wheel makes this stroller the easiest thing to steer and our kids love it.  Our kids our three and one, both fit in the stroller comfortably.  The only draw back to the stroller is it does not have a cup holder for the parents
i use this mat for yoga, martial arts, and many other exersizes.  it is very soft/comfortable plus it has a cool look. it seems to be very durable and doesn't slip even when i am sweating bullets. i believe it is definatly worth the money i spent. this is the best mat i have ever had!!
I bought this for my neighbors little girl and she loved it! It was easy to put together, just took a few minutes, and away she went! Great price and I got a big hug
I like how this thing folds up nicely so after scooting around downtown (the kid, not me) I could fold it up when we enter grand central market without hitting anyone in the shins. As for age requirements, the manufacturer recommends 5 years of age. I say that's about right but get padding for every possible body part and make sure to teach her/him how to fall correctly...ie, not on unpadded body parts like your hands...And red works for boys and girls...so if you're thinking about the pink or blue one and for some reason it's double the price stick with this..
The scooter is fine. the post office lost the package, though. I called the company and they told me they would issue a refund only after so many days/weeks, and would not send a replacement unless I was willing to pay for it in advance. I opted to purchase another one through a different company that used UPS instead of USPS (more reliable shipping). Several days later the first scooter arrived, three weeks late. the cost to return it was high enough that it made more sense to just keep it. So, now I have two and only needed one. I realize USPS is at fault for the shipping, but a better action plan from the seller could have resolved this quicker. The scooter was a present for a birthday. I ordered in plenty of time to receive prior, but ended up with a very late present
what are you waiting for? quite reading my review and get this great scooter
This gun shoots fast, hard, and accurate. Plus all the extras you get with it are just awesome
the racquet isnt orange lol it is yellow and grey..ive used it since it first came out and i love it..strings break a lot it seems like..i have to get mine restrung about every month but other than that its a good racque
Now, I have been playing tennis for 8 years and I must say, this is my favorite racket I have used. I have been using it for about two years or so and plan on using it for many more. It seems Head Liquidmetal rackets are gaining alot of popularity and I have seen more players using them within the last year or so. For me, the strings break roughly every 3 or 5 months. However, if you play at a less competitive level. They will break twice a year maybe. If you're just starting to play tennis, I don't think this would be a good racket to begin with, however if you play for a while and find yourself enjoying the sport and wish to play long term, this is the racket you need. Enjoy
I was actually surprised at how much this bike exceeded my expectations.  It's more than quiet, it's SILENT.  Very good resistance settings and even a nice variety of programs.  The bike is sturdy and easy to put together.  It's compact and doesn't take up a lot of room and the seat is also quite comfortable.  I couldn't be more happy with this purchase.  For those concerned about the shipping issues that were raised, my box had a dent or two, but the contents were fine and there were no missing parts
This is the best wind up light you're going to find. I advise everyone to get one for that unexpected event. Our power goes out about twice a winter from ice storms and this is one of my favorite lights and can be depended on along with the light from the freeplay plus. I got mine at the local Target store and I think it was only $35.00 and well worth it
some of the pros of buying the sniper rifle is...it shoots crazy fast and is very accurateI shot my uncle with it and it made him BLEEDnone of the kids in my neighborhood want to fite against me any moresome of the cons of buying the sniper rifle is...the safety can't be pushed to hard or it comes outthe handle starts getting kind of wobly and mine came offthe battery takes longer than it says to charge to workplease take my advice because I have had this gun for more than a year now and I know it front and back
First off, those of you calling it a "clip" should know that a clip is a nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched to or built into the gun itself. Please call it a magazine (actual name for it) And a full metal jacket isnt a full magazine of amunition its a bullet with a full metal casing like say 30-06 round. Second, dont complain about the scope because it is a decorative instrument. you can buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you are hardcore then get a real gun. this gun is good for shooting your little cousin from far away. Its a great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant to be used and abused like a ww2 garand or bar. It's plastic, it shoots things. I'm probably reinstating most of what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance. So yeah get this gun if airsoft is a hobby for you. NOT A SPORT. I also suggest getting .20g bbs and maybe a speedloader or 2 cause mags are so expensive and this gun pours ammo like water. Have fun.P.S. Though they may noth have the trigger finger ability, spring airsoft guns have a tendency to be more accurate and fire harder with heavier bb's. If you are playin with friends i suggest getting a $30 dollar rifle with 250-300 fps (shoots like 300-350
My grandson loved this beginners set of 500-plus cards. And what a price. About a penny apiece.
I am a plus size person, 6' tall with 69" hips and within the 400# weight limit.  This chair fits me perfectly and feels so sturdy!  I did a lot of research trying to find a chair that would accomodate me and my friends and this is the one!  I will be buying more!  The manufacturer of the chair states that ".... a 300 pound person can use this chair and it will withstand vigorous use. We work in conjunction with STR Labs to develop and administer destructive testing of our products. Our "reality check" is for a TRAVELCHAIR product to withstand twice the force exerted by the recommended weight limit in an "agressive" situation.
I never found the fork part of a spork to be very useful. Now we have this Light My Fire spork, and I have to wonder why nobody thought of this before! Nearly perfect for typical backpacker meals - probably MRE's too. If you've a friend or relative "over there", send 'em one
It is a good one. Strong and to some extent heavy. I improved a lot
This has to be one the best Protein supplements in the market! And more importantly, the taste is just unbelievable! The Banana Creme and Vanilla flavors are the best. From a "Supplement Facts" perspective, each RTD bottle is packed with 32, yeah 32g of Protein, and only 14g of Carbohydrates! The Total fat is 16g which might be on the higher side, again 6g of which are in the form of MCT (Medium Chain Triglycerides) that are typically burned as energy and aren't stored as body fat! All in all, it works really good for me and if you are an active person like I am, you should prolly go get yourself some. (GNC also sells this for like 3 bucks
I do upside down situps with a 50 pound vest on and a 25 pound dumbell in each hand. I weigh 185 pounds. No creaks bends or falls, great produc
Being a bodybuilder, I hoist heavy weights all the time; a major stress especially when it comes to squats.  I ordered the boots when I realized I had shrunk to 5'10.5" from being 6'0.5".  I was thusly very happy when after approximately 5 weeks of hanging (5 times a week, 10-15 min intervals) that I am nearly back to my original height (6' 0.25").  I highly suggest this product as a supplement to good [emphasis on good] chiropractic care.  To those who have/will order this product, don't be discouraged if it seems to hurt your back at first; that's totally normal because your back is trying to readjust while the discs [which cushion the vertebrate] start rehydrating.  Also, it will take some time to find the strap tightness that's right for your legs.  Generally, tighter on the top strap and looser on the bottom is a good combination.p.s.  Hang from a real pull-up bar and make sure you have someone to spot you if you are not strong enough to pull yourself back up the bar to unlatch yourself.
This has been a great addition to my truck - a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system (and without having to learn another techno-gadget).  My only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter.  I realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one's night vision, but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night.
My unit was really easy to install ... no wires just suction cups for the main unit and no tools required for the temperature unit.  I drive mostly during the day so I like the unit, but those who do night driving cannot see the DIM LIGHT.I had to remove unit in order to pass the VA state inspection.In cold weather, the temp guage sometimes does not work.Also, about the temp sensor ... If you place it too near the hot parts of the radiator it will not be accurate while driving in town or when stopped.  Behind the front license tag is great ... I put an old license tag under the new one and drilled holes to hold the temp sensor. That method works great.I really like the automatic calibration feature
We had been looking for a light-weight backpacking tent with enough room for two. That seems simple enough, unless you've actually been inside of some of the "two-person" tents. Some of the expedition tents meet the size requirements, but are too heavy to be considered backpacking tents. We have just used this tent for the first time, and we are so far pleased. Plenty of room inside for two adults with large sleeping mats and sleeping bags, and a bit of gear. A large vesitibule on each side provides plenty of room for packs. I believe this will be a great warm-weather tent, with all of the mesh. The night we used it, it dropped below freezing. We woke to a ceiling (rainfly) covered in ice (on the inside). Didn't really expect that, with all of the ventilation, but as it was ice, it didn't drip on us. I'll chalk this experience up to extreme conditions until we use it in warmer weather. One thing that I don't like, although thus far it has not been an issue, is a seam running through the middle of the floor. It has been taped and sealed at the factory, but I just don't like the looks of it. I will seal it again before spring use, and edit this report, as we are sure to end up in a downpour here in south Texas. The tent is in fact lightweight and roomy, and so far, I am pleased. I will amend this report after having enountered weather with it
This really is a great tent.  Three people can sleep in it, but I've found it best for 2 people because then there's still room for all of your stuff (or a dog. lol).  I've used it for 3 years, and it never disappoints.  I've been in one good thunderstorm in it, and it did great and didn't leak at all.  It's very easy to set up, (especially when you arrive at your site after dark).  It vents really well, but best if you face the vented side into the wind.  Just don't forget to open out the little cross vent (with the "!") on the other side.  The inside pockets are really handy, and I think you can get a "net" that you can hang from above for more storage
bike has very nice detailing, paint has a nice shine, really like the fenders to help keep daughter clean, great buy!
This ab machine focuses your workout on the abdominal muscles like not many other ab machines do.  You'll be surprised by the results
This is a great starter board for the price.  My son has really enjoyed using it and the price was unbeatable.  Seems to be holding up well and it serves the purpose for a beginner
Difficult to put together with just one person, though not impossible. Seems better for a child under 3 feet tall, though my daughter and I are making do.  She loves it
This bike seat IS a HUGE pain to install on a bike. It took my husband and I working together about an hour to get it right and there were several points when we thought it wouldn't work...we persevered and got it on. It is fabulous to ride with our son. It is very sturdy. Our son is very large and rides in it just fine. The helmet slides on his head, but most helmets are tricky to get just right. Overall we have been very happy with this purchase
These keep your feet warm.  Not 6 hours but three.  Still a great help keeping feet from feeling cold
This item is a good value and comes packaged in a convienent container.  The beads can be reactivated by simply following the manufacturer's instructions and baking in an oven.  the 40 gram package is nice sized for small spaces/drawers, however larger spaces may require more than one.  Overall, this item is a nice value for those that do not want to buy the silica gel in a bulk package and deal with making your own container(s).  I would recommend for anyone keeping tools or other collectables where moisture is not wanted
I just bought the SpeedBelt 2, deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me. So far, the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5-10 mile run range. It fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle. For longer runs, I'd suggest the 4-bottle belt, but this one is great for the intermediate range. The belt fits comfortably and I didn't feel that it bounced around much at all. Recommended
I have been completely satisfied with Jansport backpacks.  They are very well made and I love the guarantee.  The straps are more comfortable than other backpacks purchased.  My 14 year old son has had one for three years, and it is still in great condition.  Previous cheaper backpacks have lasted a year or two at the most.  This model has lots of zipper pockets in different sizes for storing just about anything you'd want to put in a backpack.  Great product
I've had this backpack for about 5 months now, and I still have a great opinion of it. It holds many books and folders... It can also accomodate my Inspiron laptop with a 15.4'' screen. The backpack doesn't have an included laptop sleeve, so I found a solution by buying the Sumdex Padded Large Laptop sleeve, which isn't very expensive, but very protective and a perfect fit, and just putting the Laptop in the sleeve then putting the sleeve into my backpack. Even after doing so, I still had room for a couple of books. Keep in mind that this does make it a large backpack, slightly bulky, so if you aren't in need of something with such a high capacity, then this might not be the backpack for you.The backpack doesn't have a lot of organization as far as dedicated slots for pencils, pens, etc... It just has a few smaller zippered openings. If you have a lot of stuff in them, you will be having to fumble around your things. I didn't find this too troublesome overall, though.The backpack is comfortable, and seems to be holding up pretty well against all the weight of my nursing books, etc...I am happy with my purchase, as I always have been with Jansport purchases
Hey,I decided to review some things I didn't buy off Amazon, but I have owned for sometime that are really great items: the kind I would buy again for sure if they were lost. I would say lost or broken, but Jansport has lifetime warranties! If anything happens to your backpack, all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem, they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you. They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon. Overall, these are such great products, you just have to get a Jansport if you're thinking of a backpack.Also, I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful, which I hope it really is, I would love to have your yes vote!With Care, Sa
We pruchased this tent for our annual car camping trip in Northern MI, where weather is very unpredictable.  We've had other tents that took FOREVER to set up, but this one was super simple.  I think it too two of us less than 15 minutes to have it up and ready.  We loved the size of this tent - plenty of room for our air mattress and gear.  The air circulation was great, too.  Even in the heat of the day, we had a nice breeze keeping us cool, thanks to a miriad of windows.  When rain came during the night, we stayed dry, though I would recommend sealing the seams prior to using this tent.  Overall, we're really happy with this tent (especially for the price!), and plan to use it for several years
I just got this from Khol's. They had it on sale for $11.99. When I saw it, there were plenty on the shelves. I was kind of curious as to what they were because of its funny shape.  There was a try me sign on there. So in my boredom, while waiting for my ride, I read the directions on the back and actually tried it. It was kind of funny to read 'wind up for light'.I'm glad I checked out the aisle. I've never seen anything so cool.It's very simple to wind-up the flashlight. The ball has a special roller that allows you to pump easily. It's not difficult to follow the instructions. Anyone could do it. The lightbulb is LED so according to my internet research LED:"LEDs have an extremely long life span, twice longer than the best fluorescent bulbs and twenty times longer than the best incandescent bulbs."The design is actually very nice to the touch. It's padded with some nice rubber grip, so its not unpleasant to hold. It's not very heavy at all. It's about the size of a male's electric shaver.I bought it at Khol's for more money than its listed here on Amazon. I got it today and I showed my younger siblings. They loved it, too.Basically the light is powered by the mechanical motion of your hand. It's really simple to use and its a comfortable design. I plan on going back to get more tomorrow.) 
2nd Suunto. 1st was a Vector bought in 2000 that I abused pretty good before having to get another (water seal was damaged and it took on water during a kayaking trip). Doubt I'll ever use the heart monitor in the mountains but it is excellent for training. Highly recommended
I after drooling over this watch for two years wishing I had one, I finally got one and have had my Advizor for two months now.  All I can say is that if I had known how cool this thing really was, I would have shelled out the $300 a long time ago. Each one of the features listed above does everything you could want. The Heart Rate Monitor has target zone settings, average workout heart rate, highest and lowest hear rate, and more. The Altimeter tells your rate of ascent, total vertical climb and stores all the data from recent workouts in memory. The coolest feature is that it will store your heart rate, altitude and rate of ascent/decent at intervals from 20 seconds to ten minutes so that after a workout you can scroll though and see how your heart rate was affected by altitude and acent rate. I got completely geeky with this information after one workout, and I typed it all into my computer so I could see what it looked like. The only drawback to the Advizor is that it gives you so much information, it would be great if you could download it directly to a computer for analysis. There is no PC link, so any analysis has to be done on the watch or typed in by hand. But other than that, this gizmo is perfect. No problems at all so far and I use the thing for two workouts a day.  I am a cross country ski racer and for a long time I had thought that this would be the perfect training aid for endurance athletes and now that I have tried it I know that it is
They get the job done, but the handles are a little thin and can get uncomfortable during the last couple of set
This review will focus on the specs since there is minimal information available unless you buy the bike.First off, this is my second Mongoose.  I started out on a crappy low end Cruiser model, so anything even half a step up from that model is a vast improvement.  The Theory weighs about 38 lbs and is actually light grey in color despite the image on this website.  I thought I was getting a white bike, and I'm a little ticked it's actually grey, but, whateva.Assembly isn't too bad as long as you have half a clue as to what you're doing.  The documentation is adequate, but don't expect to be able to assemble this bike correctly if you haven't done it before.  The documentation will frustrate you.  But the average person can probably install the pedals and the saddle, and maybe even mount the handlbars correctly assuming the brakes don't arrive screwed up like mine did.  The front cable had to be relocated because when it was assembled at the plant, it was threaded immediately under the fork and the tire was rubbing against it so it had to be removed and resituated, which entailed messing with the front cable.  Simple enough, I suppose, but this assumes you know what you're doing.  I couldn't install the front tire correctly because of the disc brake, and, wanting to be safe instead of stupid, I took the bike to an LBS and had them install it. It was then that I found out one of the disc pads was missing.  No problem.  I just went back home and found it in the box. Apparently it had become dislodged from the housing on the front tire during transit.  I didn't even know it was there because I haven't worked with disc pads before. It was a good thing I didn't toss the box right away otherwise I would have been SOL.  Just be advised, however, that if you are missing one or both disc pads and do toss out the box before you realize one of the pads is missing, depending on where you are, you may or may not be able to find replacement pads.  You may end up having to upgrade to a better brand disc brake.Now onto the specs.  The front disc brake is Promax brand, DSK-400, which in the world of mtn biking, is the generic low end.  I had to do some digging around on the web to find the following site because you won't find a "[...]" website.  It wasn't really all that much more helpful and did not help me to understand disc brakes any better, but at least you'll have a better idea what to look for.  The documentation on the site have color images vs the black and white images that come enclosed with the bike.   Go here instead:  [...]I wouldn't call the Promax disc brake crap, but, close enough.  Note: If you plan on doing any kind of semi-serious mtn biking, as in on a trail considered "intermediate" level, then upgrade the disc brakes.  And if you're planning a real mtn biking trip with rocks and logs and the whole nine, then the Theory can probably handle it, just don't expect miracles.As to the gears, there are 21 Shimano flavored and they work flawlessly.  They're a pleasure to have because there isn't the usual slipping and dragging you see on lower end Mongoose mtn bikes.  The only problem I had was the upper gears don't seem to want to shift into any gear definitely unless you downshift say, to 2, then upshift to 3, for example, and so forth for the others.  If you want 6, then go to 5, then upshift and vice versa.  This may or may not be because the cogs need to be lubed.As to the ride, the Theory is a dual-suspension bike and you can really feel the difference vs a hard-tail bike.  Wow.  Just riding on the street and going over speed bumps and rain gulleys is amazing.  You have very little to no shock at all because the suspension absorbs it.   Overall, this bike is good bang for the buck, but I wouldn't pay over $300.00 tops for it.  If you're going to go that high, you can get something else with higher end parts.  Oh, one last thing.  If you value your reproductive organs, and don't want to find yourself numb from package to exit and/or sitting on a bag of frozen peas for a week after using the bike, then do yourself a favor and switch out the saddle.  The one that comes with the Theory is horrible.  Get a thicker padded, gel lined, split saddle instead. 
When the product came I realized that it wasn't what I was looking for in a fanny pack but I was impressed with its rugged construction.  I needed a pack to walk around Disney World and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy.  I like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day.  The water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle. Plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another Dasani.  Unfortunately, you can't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that wouldn't stop a regular 16 oz. job from slipping passed.  So I'm returning mine, but if your looking for non breakable, wide mouthed water bottles, in a rugged waistpack then this is for you.   PS for some reason the blue one is cheaper, at least when I bought it
Smooth and easy to use.  Also, easy to run on.  Not quite as portable as I thought it would be, but to have a quality machine I guess it needs to be a little on the large size.
The Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill is as good as advertised.  It was easy to assemble and the instructions were thorough.  It is also very easy to program and operate.  No time is wasted figuring out the instruction manual.  I also love the quietness of the motor.  Because the machine is sturdy you will need some help moving it into place.  Go ahead and get it...Ma
This gun was Great. When I got it I immediatly Pulled it out and went to play with it. Good For Kids Just starting out with bb guns. Also It isn't that Powerful. Overall this gun is great and i cant beleive it is $0.0
No, this gun isn't very powerful - but THAT'S THE POINT. This gun is perfect for a young kid to learn about guns.  Slow enough you can actually see the BB, accurate enough to hit a target routinely at around 20 to 25 feet
Well, I originally ordered the Black UTG Black Sniper Rifle, but was out of stock at Air-Splat. Well, I could have waited 3-4 weeks or get the Green UTG OD Green Sniper Rifle that I had been thinking about ahead of time. So I sent a reply e-mail and they sent this rifle about 3 days later. The screws, you get some screws, now on the newer versions, the long screw that is supposed to go in the port behind the trigger, is not the long screw. You put in a short screw, well at least for me. I had tried to figure out what was wrong, finally decided to call them and they told me what to do.Now to the Gun- Excelent. Definently get a scope if you plan on being a sniper. Also, have your friends wear good goggles and no bear skin. It will either bleed or nice a welt, and if thats cool with you, than by all means dont tell them untill its to late. The gun itself should only be used with .20g and up. Anything less will ruin the gun. With .20g you can easily punch through a unopened can of soda. The gun in a airsoft battle is a bit mixed. Personally, I stay back and take head shots at the other team's leaders and medics. With the bolt-action that you use, you can decide when you are going to relode. Also, you should also get alot of white .20g. With white .20g, you can adjust where you fire and get even more accurate shots. Pros:Very accurateVery painful (could be con, depends on how you look at it)Weighted wellVery intimidating looking Cons:A bit heavy for long games (But you should be moving anyways now should you?)If you dont sight your scope (or dont even get one) there are no aiming sights, it would be a bit wasy to miss
I just ordered this beauty.  The price is right, the price will probably be more expensive in a few months.  The full tang is very sturdy.  The handle is usually a lil thin (flat) on these type of blades.  I was also looking at the Galaxy Viper twin blades in silver (also comes in black) but there's no pic of the shealth.  It just says it's nylon shealth.  It holds the 2 blades.  This wasn't exactly what I was looking for so I chose the Ronin.  BTW, I got the last 1 from a seller.  They were out of stock last time I checked. 
It was just what I wanted--a relatively stress-free low-impact workout that you can do while zoning out in front of the tv. Takes about 30 minutes to put together. It's quiet, stowable, and fun. My ten-year-old likes it, too. I don't have any problems keeping my feet in the straps as long as I'm wearing shoes, so maybe the people who were complaining about that issue hadn't been wearing shoes. A really nice little machine, and what a great price
I bought the swim goggle for my wife as a gift and she loves the product. It is a lot better than the swim goggle you would buy at a store. I recommend this product for those who swim as part of their exercise routine
after a several uses, the anti-fog starts to fail... at the beginning when it is band new, it works great! Clear and sharp.I always wash it with water and hand soap after swimming to clean up the clorine ...  still, the anti fog inner layer wears out quickly.The good thing is that it doesn't leak... that's the important part.Over all, it's still a great product compare to other models.  If not because of the poor anti-fog thing, I would have give it a 5 stars rating
I bought these [clear color version] as a gift for a young adult male who is an avid indoor swimmer.  According to the gift recipient, "they're excellent," they really don't leak or fog up.  He was thrilled to finally find a pair of goggles that didn't get any water in his eyes. (but please note: he doesn't swim for more than one half-hour at a time, so I can't vouch for whether they stay unfogged after longer periods of continuous pool activity.) He also said that the fit is very good, and the choices of nose bridge make these goggles accessible to most face types.  For the price, these are an excellent bargain
Waterproof cases are so expensive!  (and heavy) We aren't divers, but spend lots of time outdoors in conditions hostile to electronics, skiing, hiking, fishing, at the beach, etc.  In addition to water, dirty hands, sand, and dust are hazards.This Aquapac performs as described, kept the camera (Canon A95) safe and dry despite immersion in swimming pool etc.  The picture quality was unaffected, but flash doesn't work well due to internal reflections.Well worth the price
I purchased these skates for my Grand-daughter and she just loves these skates. I thought that with her being only 4 years old she would not be able to pop out the wheels but she did it and off she went. She tries to wear these skates everywhere
I bought my son and daughter a pair of these shoes for Christmas. I have a hard time getting them to wear regular shoes anymore, they love to wear them everywhere they go.  Great way to get the kids physically active!
I recently returned from almost 3 weeks of treking around Italy. I'm not a runner (or a walker, or even mildly aerobic) and I have baby-tender feet, so I was very concerned about blistering. On the advice of some runner-friends, I bought BodyGlide and coated my feet with it EVERY DAY before I put on my socks and shoes. My feet were tired and achy every night, but NO BLISTERS!! This is an amazing testament to the power of BodyGlide because sometimes I can have blisters wearing normal shoes during a normal, low activity work-day, and I was walking for hours at a time over bricks, cobblestones, you-name-it. If you are going to be traveling where you will be walking more than usual or on a differnt terrain then you are used to, buy a big, ol stick of Bodyglide and coat your feet every day
This stuff is excellent, it goes on easy like a roll on and lasts the whole run whether it be 30 minutes or 6 hours, even with a complete sweat.I would recommend this product to all short and long distance runners.
Me and a friend bought 2 of these.  They look really cool.  However they are not sharp at all (hence only 4 stars).  For $15 they are really good value though.  The hilt is plastic and the blade is a little thin.  Other than that they are quite good. 
I use these for MMA type workout on bags blocking pads, and they have worked well. They give good protection even when hitting hard. I have not had the problem with dye fading that I noticed with some other gloves. Overall I would reccomend, about the same or less than other gloves from everlast, century, ect and just as good quality.FYI There are a lot of visible seams where the pads "pockets" are attached (especially on the fingers) that you can't see well in the picture advertised. I do't think this is a big deal as many bag gloves have this, I wouldn't use them to spar as these would tend to cut. (most people would use "fighting gloves" to spar anyway, but just trying to be helpful !!
Great item, and great shipping.  Recieved product in a timely manner. 
this is a must have for anyone interested in boxing or boxing fitness. Everlast is the most trusted brand in boxing history. established in 1910 they are a quality company that specializes in boxing equipment. take it from an owner of an everlast heavy bag they are great and very durable and can withstand lots of punishment. great for any teen, young male or old tymer tryin to get his groove back
Just beat the ever-living snot out of the thing! When it's wore out... get another one and continue beating the snot out of it.Merry Christmas.Blessings,Eri
You want to loose that gut, build muscles everywhere and become a lethal adversary all at the same time? Then get a punching bag and pair of gloves. To be honest the hardest part is getting the bag to stay on the hook without pulling out your ceiling every few days. You need to consult a hardware store for the right bolt fitting. Getting this right is half the battle. When you have finally managed to find the right bolt type for your ceiling then you are on your way to becoming somebody else! 10 minutes a day will make you a mean lean machine within two months, guaranteed. Start by looking for the boxing posture on the internet. Take up this basic stance and learn to throw punches while protecting your face with the other glove. Tuck that chin in. You will cut your knuckles, even with gloves on, but these wounds will heal and soon you will find your hands hardening up with each blow. Move around the bag and make those strikes count each time. Feel the punch and try to avoid awkward possible wrist breaking miss-strikes that you don't want to make. Within a few days you will find yourself building up a quicker pace. Everyday your arms will be firmer and your muscles bigger. Your hands will become stronger. Take off the gloves at the end of the punching workout and try chopping the bag with the base of the hand, directly under the thumb with the thumb stretched out and the elbow bent. Strike downwards and sideways with the palm facing down, never up. Harden up those chop areas of the hands. Now when you have built up some nice chopping combos without gloves and boxing combos with gloves, it is time to throw in some elbow blows. Move that hand in towards your chest and strike just above the elbow with each arm. Twist that body and harden up those areas on both arms. Start striking with elbows, gloves or chops in whatever order you want. Build up a rhythm to your workout and soon you will be throwing twenty move combos at the bag. You will stun yourself. Now the next step is either to take up a proper boxing course for correction or go study some manuals on Close Quarter Combat. It beats most of the far east martial arts by using some brute force quick knockdown strategies. Try "Get Tough" by W. E. Fairbairn for starters. Rubber knives are also good. Learn the strategy in "Kill or Get Killed" by Rex Applegate. Keep up with the sport boxing and learn these powerful World War II Trench Warfare Close Quarter Combat manoeuvres for self defence. And it all starts right here with the bag. Bag owners simply have the power
I too recieved this bag in a box semi-beaten up, but then again an 80 pound item in a lightweight cardboard box is bound to cause a little box damage. And no there was no interior protective bag, and my chain pack was tied with pink ribbon.    Now to the bag itself... The toughest, most well filled, and economical bags I have ever seen. I use light bag gloves and with the amount of filling and it's density I can punch for hours (If I had the stamina :) ), without getting the sore knuckles or the wrist pain that I used to get from denser packed bags. Plus it's an Everlast!!! This is a must buy for anyone who is looking for a heavy bag. Good luck and TRAIN HARD!!
... and I wanted to pump it up. I have a bicycle pump in the garage, but no adapter for the ball. I figured that, at the price of this item, I had little to lose and much to gain. I got what I wanted, for less than 10 bucks delivered. I'm quite satisfied
Hand wraps were sent quickly and were in good condition.  Thanks
My child recieved this for Christmas. He Loved it so much. His older brothers have big ones and now he feels like a big boy since he has one too
I am very pleased with the quality of the inversion therapy table.  It is sturdy, reasonably priced, and it was easy to assemble.  Instructions provided were clear and concise
Here's the deal with this item: it's fine for little girls (and I suppose, little boys that are inclined to dance) who haven't been exposed to a better dance game.  I got this for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter; she takes dance, likes dancing, has never had or known about another 'Dance Dance Revolution' game, and she LOVES IT.  It's a big hit; she's jumping all over the place, adds up her score at the end of each song, and it's been a great, cheap gift, with exercise to boot.No, it's not sophisticated.  Older kids or teens (not to mention adults) would grimace in pain over the ancient graphics and lousy sound.  For them, get one that goes in their PlayStation or whatever.  However, many 5 year old girls don't have a PlayStation, or need one.  This is perfect for them.  For $[...] and shipping, it worked out great for a little kid.  For a teen, it's $[...] wasted.  That's the difference
This was such an unusual and unique idea. I gave it as a gift, and the person really liked it! It's different than the usual type of world series champions type posters. The artist who made this was very creative
I use my inversion table two or three times a day for short intervals of a few minutes each whenever my lower back startsto hurt or tighten up. Shorter and less intensive periods of use achieve better results that longer and fewer periods ofuse. You don't have to change clothes to use the inversiontable; you simply get on it, wearing a suit, blue jeans or pajamas. You're not going to break a sweat...you're going tostretch your back muscles and spinal cord, which doesn't takeany physical exertion. You should wear shoes to help you hangupside down on the inverstion table without your feet slippingout of the stirrups I highly recommend it for people sufferingfrom back fatigue and back pain. I no longer need to take any expensive medication to alleviate back pain or fatigue
haven't had for long but it seems to be a nice deal for the money.  It does a lot of exercises.  And seems easy to convert between types
I bought this machine because of the low price, and I was skeptical whether it would be worthwhile. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. It is a great machine, especially for beginners who want upper body workouts. If you're a serious athlete, or if you want leg exercises, this may not be the best machine for you. For me, it is working out great, and I have purchased other machines to give me the leg exercises I want. At first, I was dismayed by the fact that there were over 100 parts to assemble, but they went together very quickly and easily, and all the tools are included. Be advised that this is only for users weighing up to 120 kilograms, or 264 pounds. Great product
The gym is very easy to assemble, took me about 45 minutes on my own.  The book supplies several different workouts, hitting every major muscle group, and you get good resistance in every workout. You won't get great range of motion on all the workouts, there may be times when you'll need to lean back or put yourself in a different position in order to get a full stretch, but those are minor adjustments you'd probably have to make on any other type of equipment.  The gym itself is light, easy to move around the house, and doesn't take up much space. It may be too light, and not sturdy enough in some instances, and you will need to stand on the frame in the stand-up workouts. The price is outstanding, at 180 dollars. You're not going to find a better deal than this, and the workout is very comparable to the far more expensive Bowflex
My 9 month old loves this toy.  Before he got the hang of pushing the lever down to spin the balls, he would roll it on the floor and    crawl after it. It keeps him entertained and he keeps coming back to it. Also, there are no loose parts or pieces to lose, which I appreciate.  Great toy
A friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the Blackburn Airfix after I bought it. He has had many occasions where his chain has broken, or his tires have punctured, so he wanted to compare the weight of the Blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides. The Airfix weighed in at about 245 grams - about 8 ounces - and his tools, including inflator, tire levers, hex wrenches and chain tool (all included in the airfix) tipped the scales at 337 grams - about 11 ounces. I suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools, but for handiness, this seems hard to beat. The Blackburn lifetime/no-questions-asked guarantee is also very attractive.So while I have yet had to put this tool into action with either my Trek 2200zr or my Trek 6000, in a world where every ounce of weight is a heavy concern, pardon the pun, I imagine I have made a wise purchase
These bikes arrived very shortly after ordering, were exactly what I was looking for and were fairly easy to assemble.  The only glitch was that one bike was missing a fender and I didn't know who to contact
I really like this bike. It's great.  The only complaint I have is with Amazon.Com Customer Service.  The bike came partly assembled.  You really should tell customers exactly what they will have to assemble.  I put the seat and pedals on.  The "quick release" for the front tire was missing from the box.  I called customer service and they could not send me one.  She said I would have to send the bike back and get a new one.  She couldn't even give me the number of the mfg.  I was so mad.  I didn't want to send the bike back that was too much trouble.  I took it to a bike dealer and he put the front wheel on. 
I really like this bike. It feels like a bike from the '50s but with all the modern technology. The look is great and draws a lot of attention. It is somewhat simple to complete the bike since it arrives mostly put together but the assembly instructions are the worst I have ever seen with any product. I basically got no clue from the instructions on how to finish off the bike, it is hard to believe how poorly they are written. I was beginning to believe they sent me the wrong directions. After I got it together through trial and error the brakes and the shifter were way out of whack and I had to spend $30 at a local bike shop to get these items adjusted; the instructions for making the adjustment did not work. The guys at the bike shop took two attempts to get it right (two trips for me) and they were wondering why it was so difficult to adjust. After all that was done I love the bike and it rides nicely and when properly adjusted, shifts and brakes very nicely. The ride is comfortable and I love the seat and location of the handlebars. I would recommend the bike for all the fun and looks it has but be prepared for some hassle to get it right unless you are one of the lucky ones who gets one that is adjusted correctly out of the box. My suggestion is for the manufacture of this bike to fire the idiot who wrote the assembly instructions and hire someone with some writing skills. I also do not understand why the brakes and shifter were so far out of adjustment; did no one test the bike before they boxed it up
The Pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price. The odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate. The set-up and operations get easier with use (first few times you will need to refer to the manual). The manual is well written and thorough. The cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate
I just received the Blackburn Delphi 6.0 earlier this week, and I've already put it through a few rides.  I'm upgrading from a Cateye Astrale 8 that I've had for a long time.  I've started training with a heart rate monitor more seriously lately, and I thought having a single integrated unit to handle both features would be great.  I almost bought the Delphi 5.0 a while ago, but decided to hold out for the 6.0 to get the nifty altimeter features.Here are my impressions about my new computer, good and bad...Pros:- The mounting bracket system is very clever, and seems better that the Cateye bracket I was used to.  Changeble soft platic shims line the bracket clamp, changing the fit for different handlebar diameters.  3 different thicknesses are included, which chould accomodate everything from skinny aerobar computer mounts to oversized road handlebars.- The altimeter function is great.  The altitude measurement is solid and seems very accurate.  The percent grade reading acts sensibly, even though it lags a little (this is explained in the manual).  The distance climbed at the end of a ride agrees very well with topographic software, and works far better than the GPS-based solution I had been using.- The Lap feature is great for capturing statistical snapshots of particular segments of your ride.  Had a big hill on your route, and want to know how much you climbed and how fast you averaged up the grade?  The Delphi makes it really easy to see those sections taken out of the whole.  Up to 20 laps can be recorded.  I think of them less as "laps" and more as "intervals".- The backlight feature is very cool.  I've always just done without computer info at night before...but this way, I don't have to.  I'm sure it kills batteries, but it's nice to have.Cons:- The average speed algorithm seems a little flaky.  It seems to read ay least 0.1 mph slower than one would get by simply dividing distance by ride time.  My Cateye always agreed well with the calculated value, but the way the Delphi is figuring the average must be different.  This is liveable, and seems to be less of a problem on routes without a lot of stopping.- The max heart rate reading can get ruined by frequent "spikes", so that the real Max HR is unknown.  Finishing a ride, it's possible that the max HR will show something unrealistic like 235, probably due to a signal glitch or some interference.  Then, you have no way of knowing what the true value is.  These spikes don't affect the average, however.  I should mention that I've seen this behavior on both of the standalone HRMs I've had before...so it's not unique to the Delphi.- The cadendce sensor was hard to mount so that the magnet was close enough to the sensor.  I had to put the magnet very close to the end of the crank, because the crank arm is close enough to the chainstay at that point.  But mounted there, the magnet covers the back side of the pedal spindle.  If you have pedals which require a hexkey from the back side to remove, that could be a problem.  They could have remedied that by making the cadence magnet a little thicker.  For comparison, my Cateye crank magnet was mounted in the middle of the arm with no problem.- The wire from the cadence-enabled bracket to the cadence sensor is very long.  This may be good for putting it out on aerobars or something, and I admit that too long is better than too short.  But I have a foot or more of extra cable to try to hide around my shifter cable housings, and it's hard to tuck that slack away.  And I have a large bike frame with plenty of tube real estate to spare.- Unlike my standalone HRMs, the Delphi doesn't calculate calories used.  Not that those numbers are ever accurate anyway, but it would be nice for ride-to-ride comparison.General ThoughtsOverall, I think it's a great computer.  The negatives above all are really minor issues, and I haven't found a computer yet that offers as much for such a reasonable price.  There's a lot more to tell than I can include in a review like this.  I'm just trying to hit the big highlights (and lowlights).  But definitely, no regrets on this end for buying it.
Love the trike--it is so cute.  My 2 yr old got it for his birthday and loves it.  The instructions to put it together were not very good, but it's a trike, so it wasn't that hard to figure out.  I would recommend this trike to any "Cars" fan!
I have 20 mo. old twin boys. I was given 2 different tricycles and each of my boys only wanted to ride the Disney McQueen trike so I had to purchace another one. This trike has two different sitting positions, has a wide wheel base for stability, and sits lower to the ground. My boys still can't use the pedels but love to use the trike as a ride on toy - It's a great trike for younger toddlers who want to ride early!
The product itself was awesome and my son loves it!!!  It is just what I hoped it would be like.The box it came in had me worried at first because it was very flimsy and tearing in certain places.  It made it difficult to carry from our porch to my room where I was hiding the kids C-mas gifts
this pair of pistols is quite entertaining. i have purchased quite a few airsoft guns in the last 6 months, and these are surprisingly the more powerful of what ive purchased. dualing spring pistols is a challenge, but there are ways to work the slide with 1 hand. they're flimsy, but with enough care and responsibility theyll last a while. definitely worth 16 buck
I just ordered a pair of these for my son, since my daughter is so pleased with them.  The wheel base is wide enough that beginners can get their balance quickly.  The wheels roll very smoothly.  The velcro attachment at the top provides ankle support, and is easier to adjust than just laces.  A fun outdoor activity!Laurie, mother of Emma (8) and Kevin (11
I ordered 2 of these kickboards in blue after reading another review. They are not exactly the same size, but we really like them. They are very versatile and easy to use. I do think they need to put dimensions on the website
I have had problems with exercise bands that break fairly easily.  Although I have not had this one long, it has shown no type of wear, and I use it every day!  I would definitely recommend this product to someone who wants to add resistance to their workout
I received my fitness bands shortly after placing my order.  At first, I was confused, because I was expecting a box and instead it was a mailer envelope, but I couldn't be more pleased with the product.  For just a couple of bucks, I am able to find different ways to challenge the muscle groups in my upper body.  Also, I can take it absolutely anywhere; one could fit in my pocket.Here is the breakdown of the different colors and resistance which I've taken from the merchant's website.Color	        ResistanceRed X-Light	3.3 lbs.Orange Light	4.5 lbs.Yellow Lt./Med.	6 lbs.Green Medium	8 lbs.Blue Med./Hvy.	10 lbs.Indigo Heavy	15 lbs.Violet X-Hvy.	20 lbs.If you can sympathize with any of the following scenarios, this product is something I would recommend for you (Well, I'd recommend it for anyone, but these are the clients who have been searching for an answer):1. You live in a tiny apartment and/or don't have a lot of a lot of storage space.  You need something that you can tuck behind your DVDs when it's not being used.2. You don't have the means to pay for weights or weight-training equipment.3. You can't afford to go to the gym, or are intimidated about going because everyone there is always so friggin' buff.Do not purchase if you are allergic to latex.  It is only 90% free of soluable allergens, so if you are allergic, don't buy it.  This information is specifically listed in the product description so ignore the poor review by the illiterate complainer.Other than that, enjoy the product and happy toning
Works real well for leg exercises, but when doing arm exercises it tends to slide downwards
I got this as a gift and just love it.  You wouldn't believe how difficult it is to balance on it without using your legs.  It's fun and you can just use it while you're watching TV.  How could that be wrong
This count up/down timer is exactly what I was looking for. No bells, no whistles -- just timings up and down. It's small and light, and can be clipped or held. It even has a magnet for attaching to metal surfaces. I only wish it had a shut-off switch so that it doesn't start counting (and beeping) if it's accidentally brushed
This is the same system released 4+ years ago.(This is the Fanny Lifter-not the Box and not the Transfirmer-the wider steps.)  I was very out of shape-couldn't make it up stairs without being out of breath.  It was very tough starting up...I couldn't make it through a whole workout until almost the 10th workout.  I went from a size 16 to a size 6.  Because of this system I have fallen in love with exercise and feeling/looking great!Allie, Lisa and Jen are great leads
I just love this workout, it really gets you sweating. It's a great workout for beginners as well, not too fast or complicated. I just started working out with The Firm System, and plan to use it to get back into shape. You can always purchase more DVD's to keep you motivated. I recommend this product to anyone who want to get into or stay in shape.      
I like this for both the biking and running/walking. Easy to set up the pedometer, a little harder for the bike. There's a long cord. The front also scratched when I removed the plastic covering making it harder to read on the right side. It's working great though and I'm happy with the product
Awesome, for an advid user in Pedometer, I really love this one.    It is accurate and consise, some other pedometers out there have many complicated menus.A Women`s Viewwww.cosmopolitangirl.co.u
My daughter love these skates so much that she did not want to take them off
wow this scope goes great with the UTG Master Sniper. It works very well when you tune it in
This product is quit usefull to walk overnigth and to do works at dark sites
This was the hit of Christmas Eve.  I gave one to my brother and husband and everyone one wanted one.  It projects light way out in front of you and is a must have for power outages and walking in the evening. Great product.  I am ordering several more
I have this for a month now. It has two pices joined by rubber which reduces the shock. In addition you might want to attach that rubber shock absorber which you can get under $5 in a sports store.Pretty happy with it
I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it.  It is a great color and texture and really like the mesh cut out for breathability.  I think I may order one for myself
This is the perfect companion to take on your next trip.  No more excuses.  The gym is now portable.  With enough resistance to give you a decent workout.  This gym rat highly recommend these bands. 
As a chef in a hot DC kitchen, I have tried all manner of powder and cream with the hope of eliminating or decreasing chafing.  At one point, I even devised a kind of "rosin bag" of cornstarch suspended on a string...THIS STUFF WORKS FOR ME.  And if it works for me, in the hours of blistering heat and hot sweat... it will work for you
This product is phenomenal.  It reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly.  It worked under my wetsuit.  It works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming.  It works between your thighs or on your chest when running.  It may even prevent blistering on your toes while running, but I can't directly confirm that.  I'd recommend reapplying every four hours
If you need to eliminate chafing from runing, jogging or just active walking, this is the stuff to use. Rolls on like deodorant. One application will last for a whole day. Highly recommend
This is the best anti-chafing product I've ever used. I'm a 40 something marathon runner, heavier than the average marathoner. Every marathon I ran left me with a bloody chafed mess on my thighs-I just ran my first marathon with this product and not a chafe-my highest recomendatio
Body Max is a very tough DVD.  I didn't find the step choreography too difficult to learn, but some of the combos were a bit quick and advanced.  I do recommend watching the cardio before attempting, or you'll be rewinding quite a bit like I did.  Cathe's cuing is great, especially while teaching the combo.The complete workout is long and tough, but completely worth it.  If you don't have enough time, there are several premixes that have shorter lengths.  The premixes may be shorter, but they're no less intense
This DVD is tough... but don't be scared. Cathe does a great job with the premixes and you can pick shorter versions of the workout. I love the music on this DVD.... It's so much fun... it makes me want to keep jumping!!! The upper body routine is about 20 minutes long. It's efficient and straight to the point.I've never seen results as quickly before... Cathe will definitely delivery results!!!
Blackburn racks are getting harder to find, but they are still at the top of the pile in terms of build quality and strength / weight.  I have had Blackburn racks on a couple bikes over the years and never had a complaint.  One is still going strong after 20 years.  Highly recommended
Just the perfect cap!. It fits like no other swimming cap. It won't pull you hair when removing it, neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning. Very resistant material, and a great finish. Awesome colors!
I bought this swim cap for my wife for Christmas and she loves it
  I got it about 2 months ago and it still works like new. i even left it in a shed uncovered and it still works great. It look very real, but the only bad thing is that the sclincer does nothing to the sound of the gun. THIS GUN IS AWESOME!!!!!
I've owned a Gust Buster for over 5 years now and it works great.  I've had it out in the early winds of a hurricane and it worked exactly as it was intended.  I like the big size because it keeps the rain away from more of me than the smaller ones do.  Mine isn't automatic, so maybe that's a problem, but every automatic umbrella I've ever owned eventually stopped working and had to be opened by hand
Attractive wood finish as seen in the picture.  It was fairly easy to put together.  Keeps the golf stuff neat and organized. 
This is a good size cot for a smallish boy scout.  It's a little small for an adult, but it fits in the tent well. The only complaint is it requires a lot of strength to set up and take apart, but it is lightweight and comfortable
This is a great cot.  It is low profile, and made of strong materials.  I was worried about the wire legs, but they are very, very strong.  So strong that it takes some muscle to get them into their holes in the frame.  This might be a drawback for someone who is weak in the arms.  It folds up easy and is very portable.  Also, I have a smaller frame, and although this cot is perfect for me, a larger frame person might want to consider a wider version for comfort in the shoulder area.  You won't be disappointed in this one for the money
  I had seen this table at an outdoor concert and have been looking for some time to find it.  Just recently I saw one being used at a resort while we were on vacation. It is easy to set up and very stable.  We will use it for  picnics as well as an additional table on our deck.  The carry bag is another plus.  No more bending over to serve food from the top of the cooler.
This is a great light, perfect for a "be seen" and backup light in addition to a stronger source.  The plastic handlebar mount failed on mine the first time out, apparently cracking from vibration fatigue.  The customer support from Princeton was terrific, though, and they sent a replacement mount (I contacted them on Friday and had the part Monday).  I may try to rig a velcro strap through the clip and attach that directly around the bar instead of using the supplied part
I bought this backpack last minute for a weekend in the columbia gorge area, It worked great.  The backpack doesn't strain my back at all, the load felt very even.  And the attached rainfly came in handy once as well.  It comes with a bunch of extra attached straps to secure all the extras (tent rods, sleeping pad, rope, etc...) I am thoroughly impressed to have found a good pack for such a bargain pric
This product does what it claims it will do.  Put in the time and effort - you'll feel great! Of course, I don't ever expect to look like the model on the box.  However, I feel good and I think I look a little better than when I started.  Only doing it a few weeks, but enjoying it
Work out every muscle in your body with this excellent workout bench.  It has a lot of features for its price, and it's very easy to assemble
I had a similar experience as did others with the packaging of this product.  The box was literally falling apart when it arrived.  Luckily no parts were damaged.  On the plus side, the package arrived very quickly.The bench has lots features for the price.  It was not difficult to assemble.  It folds up very nicely as advertised.  It is sturdy and easy to adjust.  This is a very good value
Easy assembly, Great variety of equipment to train your body, pretty sturdy, great value for what you get, only negatives are the rack arms are close together and you cant reverse the bar pins to rack the bar for easy access to do squats and military presses
I purchased this bench about a year ago. I received it in 4 business days which I thought was really good. It took me about 45 minutes to put it together, there is alot of nuts and bolts, but once I finished assembly it has been a good machine, and I am still using it to do my weight lifting routines twice a week, it offers alot of different exercises, what I really love about it is the lat tower which alot of benches do not have until you get into the $300-$400.00 dollar range, which I was not willing to spend that much at the time. For the price of 129 bucks and the options you get, just can beat it. I am very happy with this machine. This machine is made by impex fitness and I definitely plan on upgrading to another impex when Im ready. Chris- V
I love the procuct and it does provide the  reslults predicted.  However I would like to see the band width widden a couple inches or I would like to see something like this maybe in a vest/shorts combination to achieve the same results on my chest and upper stomach
It is a very good product.  Works extremely well when you using it while exercising.  Really makes you drip of sweat from your waist area
My boy loves his drinking funtainer!  It has never spilled on his lunch box even though I have put it in different positions including upside down!  It it great because we can take it on a car ride and it will NOT spill all over the car if he drops it and it will keep his milk cold and even warm chocolate hot!  The straw that pops up when you open the lid is a plus and I have not had to replace it and the year is almost over!!  Very durable.  I love it and I'm planning to buy more!  It is well worth the money... and I bought it for $15.00!!
Recently we had a chance to use a Bongo Board about 40 years old. It was all wood with quite a large drum. The one we just purchased for my 8 year old daughter is great for many reasons. It is so portable that it has become a take it anywhere with you activity. The drum has an elastic cord so that it does not completely detach from the board when balance is lost, and balance is frequently lost. Finally we have had her friends try it and from initial angst to quickly getting the hang it has become a great confidence builder for them. Great investment for year round fun
I bought this stroller to replace my Combi-Ithru, but found that I needed to keep it.  Although this Schwinn stroller has proven to live up to its reviews has one slight draw back.  The recline position is a bit to far back for "mall strolling" making it a bit uncomfortable for the baby. Aside from that, the schwinn handles tough terrain like a Mercedes Benz or Cadillac.  Its great! Baby loves the outdoors and the comfort of this stroller.  It has ample room and keeps her protected from the elements.  It steers like a dream! Grandma loves the fact that it turns on a dime.  No extra effort needed. The big wheels and shock absorbers make it a smooth ride too for the sleeping baby.  My daughter is 13 months old, 24lbs and 32 inches tall and still has plenty of roomto grow into.  The stroller has great storage space below and the handle is height adjustable.  The only thing I don't really like is the upmost recline position is a bit to far back and seems uncomfortable for baby, the reason why I kept my Combi I-thru. Aside from that, I recommend it to anyone taking long walks in multiple types of terrain! This one can handle it all.  Happy Strolling. 
Very, very good stroller! And very convinient, too. This stroller can be used on different type of terrains and is very maneuravabble.The only thing that I don't like is that the seat cannot recline or can be made straighter. My husband tried to work something out, but the thing is that the manufacturer haven't thought about it
Excellent service and a quality product at the right price.  I had no luck finding foose balls locally. 
I have stopped at least 5 shops (Walmart, Sports Authority, Target, etc.) to find foosball replacements but no avail; the table was acquired at a charity auction but had no balls.The foosballs were shipped exactly and timely as promised, and still having a lot of fun playing with family and friends
I just switched from a Suunto T6 to a T4 and this PC pod works seemless between the watch and PC. It is about 2x a paper clip and with the USB connection it is easy to carry.Although a little pricy from the competition, if you want a system to track your running and easily monitor it the T4, Foot Pod and PC Pod work very well.Down side is the software which does not support MAC, come on Suunto
I love this machine. The strech is allowed to happen at a slow and gentle pace and the legs are nicely supported. The only draw-back is the retraction process sometimes I have to push a little futher in order to release the latch to pull the legs back in. Other then that b e a utifu
 I am a dedicated martial artist that has been frustrated in my attempts to attain greater flexibility. Despite my previous instructor's claim that these types of machines are a waste of time  money, I decided to investigate the potential effectiveness of the "Versaflex". Based on this investigation, I purchased this machine  in the very short amount of time that I have used it, I am really happy. For me it makes stretching very relaxing  comfortable. I am very impressed! 
I've tried lots of goggles, These are my favorite.  I didn't like the sponge goggles because the sponge was leaky and fell apart quickly.  And I remember the days when the one-piece goggles were popular but those never fit me very well.  These are adjustable: strap and comes with three nose pieces so you can get a custom fit.  And it's comfortable like the one-piece goggles and has a no-snag silicone strap. 
I was very pleased with the quality of this product. It was perfect for the 11 year old it was purchased for, not too short--just right.  Sincerely, Terri J. Sullivan       
This is exactly what I was looking for.  I had a very similar roller at my gym (Club One) and loved it, but left the gym a while ago.A previous reviewer states that this product might be useless without the weight attachment.  Don't worry, it comes with it, and it works perfectly.  I interchange standard-sized weights all the time... have tested with up to 30lbs (30lbs is KILLER on your wrists, and I'm a fairly strong man)If you want a gym-quality wrist roller, BUY THIS NOW
i just recently bought this pistol and am very proud of it and i was wondering if the lighter .12G bb's will damage the gun because on shorty's  [...]  it says only use .2 can you guys help me out
I am very happy with this product. It's made of the best material for speed and the timer beeps if you set it. I had initially rated this product with 1 star because it was twisting up so much that it became too short to jump over. But my brother fiddled with it and discovered that (unlike the rope in the picture) there should be a gap of the plastic rope so that it's not right up against the handle. So now I would give this product a 4 star rating because the manual should have mentioned it (and the sellers should have known that).      
Great if you are serious with your kickboxing or any other martial art pad drills or sparring even!   Wrap easily and securely - nice and snug - real leather - soft but good padding and supports inside. Great wrist and fist supports upon impact!  I'd buy them again.. Need more color choices now.. :
This door gym is incredible. I have been getting great workouts with this. My arms, chest, back, and shoulders have all been noticably improved within a week. Great workout. Throw in a few miles of running and you have no excuse not to be ready for summer
On the advice of my chiropractor, I decided to buy an inversion table, but didn't want to spend a lot of money because I feared it would be yet another piece of equipment that would end up collecting dust in my spare room, along with my rowing machine and exercise bike.  So I purchased this Calm system because it was inexpensive and I figured I could sell it or send it back if I ended up not using it.Well, so far I and my spouse have found it to be very good for relieving back pain, and best of all you don't have to spend a lot of time on the machine.  About 3 or 4 minutes a couple of times a day is all it takes to relieve lower back spasms and stretch out the spine.Also, the machine is quite light weight and easily folds to shove in a closet or behind a wall unit.  Overall, I am pleasantly surprised and would recommend this system.  There is no need to spend a lot of money in order to experience the benefits of inversion therapy
It's a nice rope, with great length. My only problem is, it really stings if it hits you. Overall, it is a good robe
I am very happy with this jump rope.  It was very easy to adjust to my height.  I have not jumped rope in years and wanted something new to add to my workout.  I am enjoying this jump rope very much.  It is very light and user friendly.
i am a huge fan and i cant deside between the 2 sakabatos{the one from true swords or the one from china} are there any differences? which one is stronger?{i plan on it being a swinging sword so i dont want a flimsey sakabato} please help me desid
Our very busy toddler (17 months old) is having a good time with this scooter.  It is very well made especially for the reasonable price.  The wheels do not scratch our wood floors, unlike some of her other toys.  She is our third and we have had our fair share of similar toys.  This one is one of the better ones.  The only down side is that it could be a little lower to the ground.  She is above average height and can just reach the floor well enough to push with her feet.  Our older girls were petitie and this would have been too big for them at the recommended age of 18 months.  Once they are in their twos, our girls have preferred trikes, so I'm also not sure how long this will last as a 'favorite', but it can definately be 'handed -down' or given to friends as it is going to last for years
We purchased the Razor Scuttle Bug Trike for our two year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!  She spends hours each day zipping around on it, and it is sturdy and lightweight. My only suggestion/complaint is that it is not adjustable in height.  She is a bit tall for her age, and it would be great if the legs extended a few inches. Would likely fit best for children ages 18 months - 2 1/2 years and under 35" tall.Item comes pre-assembled and folds up flat.  Highly recommended
I struggled with the decision to buy this trike, thinking it seemed kind of cheap and plastic compared to the metal trikes of my youth. However, I ended up getting one for my 3 year old, and am going to order another for when my 1 year old is old enough. Whoever invented the rear handle steering mechanism is a genius, and me and my back thank them. I no longer live in fear of "daddy push me," since pushing doesn't require bending over to that terrible "pushing a tricycle" stance. The trike itself is lightweight and easy to maneuver. It has a low center of gravity and doesn't feel quite as tipsy as some. I recommend it
The Power Blocks are great if you don't have a lot of space to keep a full set of dumbells.  Changing weight is very easy and you can go change weight in 5 pound increments.  In addition to the 45 pound set, you can get an upgrade to increase the weight of each to 60 pounds (for around $150)
We just got this bike for my 4 1/2 year old.  It is a very sturdy bike that is easy for him to ride.  He is 45 inches tall and has about 1.5 inches clearance over the center bar.  On the box it said this bike could be used for children much shorter, but I don't see how.  It is a little bit of a struggle for him to get on the seat but once he is on he has no problems riding it.  Overall, the bike is very nice with 2 types of braking, a back pedal and hand brake.  The styling looks very nice and it arrived with no damage.  I would have given it 5 stars but the directions for putting it together were awful.  The enclosed directions were for bikes and features that this bike did not have and I was flipping back and forth trying to find relevant directions.  Putting it together is somewhat intuitive, and I did figure it out, but better directions would have been much appreciated.  
I usually do not endorse a product as "a must have" due to the diversity of personal preference in not just air soft but the firearm community... however, this item is the only exception to my rule.  I got this speed loaded to compliment my MP5 with a 100-round drum and anyone with Carpel-Tunnel Syndrome can testify to, it's a real pain to load THAT much one at a time.  To satisfy this problem, enter the speed loader.Pretty simple design and execution; open top hatch and insert up to 120 airsoft rounds, place nozzle on top of magazine and prime accordingly.  That easy.  Easily loads a 30-round magazine in less than three seconds.  It's inexpensive and easy to replace if it breaks... which it shouldn't unless you took it in the field and was dumb enough to put it in your front pouch and cracked it when you dove for cover.  Sounds ridiculous but I've seen it done by the Air Force guys I play with.But let's face it; if you only have so many magazines/drums you're going to want a speed loader to make emergency quick-loads in the field and what better way than to carry it with you.  I strongly suggest you carry it in a side pouch; I carry mine in my BDU pant leg pocket below my hip holster for easy access although I try to carry more magazines in my tactical vest to avoid using it as a last resort.  I strongly recomend against placing it in a pouch in front of you like in a tactical vest since it's made of plastic, not metal.  Lastly a warning; don't go too overboard with the primer.  Sometimes if you're not watching it you'll overload the magazine/drum and spray airsoft all over whereever you happen to be and either you've wasted ammo or you have to clean it up... unless you're at a friends house, let them clean it up.  ;
If it were possible, I would buy one of these for every airsofter in the world. YOU NEED THIS LOADER!!! Most guns come with those stupid loading tubes that require you to push the bbs down with a stick... That is the worst thing to use while youre getting shot at. This will speed up your loading time dramatically. BUY!!!!
This speed loader worked great by reducing loading of a magazine from a few minits to a few seconds. Great during an airsoft war
Its better then shakin the bottle, jams atleast once per fill but its only .89c !! Buy a few and you'll survive. Slam On !!!
First I want to make a slight correction to the previous reviewer's text: the size/weight of the gloves doesn't change according to the size of your hand but, rather, to the size of you, the user of the gloves. If you are an average sized male you will be hard pressed to find a sparring partner if you only have 10oz gloves: nobody in their right minds would agree to spar with you because with such small gloves the risk of injuring the receiver of the blows goes way up. Hence 16oz is the standard size for sparring gloves. Women can use 14oz and children 14oz and 12oz depending on how big they are. The point with heavier/bigger gloves is to protect your training partner. Anyway, on with the review: these are good, all-around sparring gloves. Their over-all quality is quite good and even the velcros are done well so you could use these for thai boxing as well without scratching your partner's neck and shoulders when clinching. However, I found that when you put more power behind your punches your knuckles tend to come through a bit so they're not the safest gloves around. Still they are good enough for pretty much anybody who's looking for a good pair of gloves for sparring. I recommend that you get a separate pair of bag gloves or 10oz gloves for bag and mitt work since hitting the heavy bag and focus mitts harden the leather which, again, makes the gloves more dangerous to use in sparring. Remember to wrap your hands and wrists when hitting the heavy bag in order to avoid knuckle, wrist, and shoulder injuries. Everlast is a good company and for the most part they make quality products. These gloves do what they are supposed to do
Similar to other reviewers, I was looking for a bench that I could do both abdominal and lower back work.  This was the only decent bench that fit the bill within this price range.  The construction is nice and sturdy, the assembly was no problem, and overall I'm very pleased.  The only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating for me is the lenghth.  I wish the main section were a foot longer, which would allow me to more easily use it with dumbells for chest work.  Although I do love how you can raise the thigh support for curls - I wouldn't have known to do that if it weren't for the photo on this site.  Bottom line: good value for a versatile bench
  Stamina Ab /Hyper Bench has sturdy construction. It is well built for home gym.
This bench was the best combination I could find that did both sit ups and hyper back exercises.  It works suprisingly well for what it costs.  The lower leg holder can be set low for back exercises, and set higher for sit ups.  The padding and covers seem decent.  Lots of adjustments.  It's not as heavy duty as the ones at gyms, but for at home I am satisfied
This bar is great when used properly, i.e. make sure the door is closed when you use it.  I was surprised how well it worked, much better than relying on someone to hold your feet while doing situps or cruches. 
I recall first hearing about Bag Balm at an adult Scout Leader training retreat.  One of the participants started talking about Bag Balm and how he used it for everything from burns to lip balm.  Needless to say, I was intrigued and, upon returning from the retreat, did a little more investigating.When I asked my wife whether she had ever heard of the stuff she immediately said that she had and that one of my toddler nephews was then using Bag Balm under a doctor's direction for pesky diaper rash.  I then began to question some of my horse riding buddies.  They too had heard of it and used it with very positive results.I immediately went out and bought a big tin for my medicine cabinet and a couple of small more portable tins to keep around my office and car and use as lip balm.I couldn't be more pleased.  I have used Bag Balm as an excellent lip balm and have used it on minor cuts and abrasions as well.  Rubbed directly into the skin.  Under Band-Aids. You name it. The stuff, as originally touted by my Scouting friend, seems also to have antibacterial properties.  Now, I am not a doctor and I don't play one on TV so please don't take that as some sort of prescription. Putting it in a nutshell, Bag Balm is incredible stuff and it works.  I highly recommend it!THE HORSEMA
I write very few reviews, but I just wanted to share my unbelievable success with healing my cracked heels.  I have fought this battle many years, with no success.  I started using this stuff 3 weeks ago, along with a heel sander, and I only have a small scar that I suspect will go away.  I cannot believe the results!!!  I only wish I had taken pictures to proof the results!!  But who wants to look at UGLY cracked heels???  LOL...it WORKS!!!!!!!!!
This has been used by our family forever! We use it on burns, diaper rashes, cuts on our animals, and just about any type of open wound--it works wonders! Plus, this trial-like size makes it perfect for the diaper bag, purse, drawer, or first aide kit
I have used this bench for a little over a week. For the price you can't go wrong. It is sturdy and seems to be well made. The adjustment is smooth and locks firmly in place. (Great for lying leg lifts). All and all this is a good bench, I would have given it five stars, but the description says it can be fully up right for use during military presses, this is not true, it can almost go vertical, but not completely.  Still, I think you would be happy with it, I am. 
I bought 3 of these for holiday presents this year and everyone loves them! Inexpensive but not easy to find. I was told easy to use. My dad labelled 2 boxes of balls on Christmas morning
I got great results coaching 2 teams last season in 2006 using the Zip N Hit as a training aid in addition to live Batting Practice. We would work it into our routine for pre-game drills and starting practice drills.  With every player maybe getting another 20-25 swings at a moving ball at each practice and pre-game session, over a season it adds up to 200-300 extra swings that you can't get from live BP (which takes too long, you must retrieve balls).  Both of my teams last year batted as a team over 0.400 in both Bronco and Pony.  I had several players bat over 0.500 and 0.600, too. It also helped them develop a level swing which improves the Batting average, and become better situational hitters. Other opposing teams also began copying us. Perfect for pre-game warmups where you aren't allowed live BP, i.e. regular games, tournament games.  Our league is now buying one kit for every team in our league as basic equipment. The players can even help drill themselves.
Durability seems to be an issue.  The cord breaks or unravels much too quickly.  The sleeve inside the ball becomes grooved and slows the ball's travel on the cord.  A sleeve made of a harder, slicker material would improve both ball speed and reduce cord wear.  Possible materials are hardened aluminum, stainless steel (polished), teflon-based plastic or polycarbonate
This table is so easy to assemble and is very lightweight for travel.  We go airplane camping in a Piper Super Cub so lightweight, compact and sturdy is a must for us.  It comes in a handy travel bag. It's a great table at a great price
I have had one of these for 10 years, but recently purchased a second one because I was having to move them between the RV and house.  This case on the newer version is so much better and the second handle is a great improvement.Every outdoor person or cook should have a Deluxe Blade Trader in their set
I ordered these for my 7 year old daughter and she loves them.  She wasn't really used to skating either, but has done very well on them. Not too many falls and learned easily.  Great item even for beginners!!!Kim Collin
Very sturdy and reasonably priced.  My daughter is just learning to skate and loves that she has her own skates that are "just like the one's at the skating rink". I would recommend these to everyone
I am a year-round bicycle commuter in Chicago who teaches classes on bike safety and riding with children.  I ride all the time at night, often with my kidsin tow.  We bought this as part of a set for my son's biketwo years ago.  It is absolutely phenomenal in it's visibility, durability, and ease of use!  I cannot recommend it enough.  I have something of a fetish about visibility when we ride our bikes at night.  I have bought just about every blinkie light out there.  This is my favorite, along with the Blackburn Mars tailight (with 7 LEDs including two amber side lights).  Mind you, the Mars is more than 3x the cost of this Bell light.  Pros--*extremely visible*multiple flasher modes*easy on/off feature for when you are locking up in a public place*long battery lifeCons--*the red shield can fall off when the bike is dropped or hits a hard bump.  We solved this problem by putting a small piece of electric tape on the top edge
This was purchased as a gift for a duck hunter.  He had used other head lamps but absolutely loved this one for the brightness and accuracy of the light when he moves his head.  I would highly recommend this product
I bought an older model of the Petzl E32 P Myolite 3 Headlamp a couple of years ago for a trip to the Grand Canyon. Although it works well when on the move, whether for hiking at night, or finding your way to the water cooler or latrine, it has two drawbacks when using it in a fixed location:- a: even when using the 3-leds (which is the less-bright option), it is so bright that one can not easily use it for reading, nor can one use it in ones tent without disturbing your tent-buddy.- b: even when using the 3-leds it is so bright that it is difficult to use it to read, since it makes the white of the page reflect back at you.Also, the weight is a bit heavy on one's head.It is for these reasons that I just went out and bought the Black Diamond Zenix IQ for my upcoming trip to Yosemite. I have been playing with it in my apartment tonight (with the lights turned off), and I can already tell that this Black Diamond model is far superior to the Petzl I bought 2 years ago. The Zenix IQ has the following features:- it is much lighter and more comfortable than the Petzel- it has 6 brightness settings (as opposed to Petzel's 2): it has 3 settings for the two LEDs, and it has 3 settings for the ultra-bright bulb.- it has a multi-function colored LED that acts as both a headlamp finder in the middle of the night (when you wake up and are looking for your headlamp), and as a battery meter to warn you ahead of time when your batteries are starting to get low
I had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap.  Now no problem!  It keeps my hair fairly dry, or at least drier than with other caps I've tried.  It's easy to put on and take off--no hair pulling.  It's lasted well so far.  Much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap. 
I highly recommend the Wenzel Raised Insta-Flex Air Bed over any other air bed out there.  I have had two other brands and Wenzel is the best.  Having a bad back, sleeping on an air mattress is not something I look forward to, but because of the height of this bed and just all around general quality, I have had no back problems and have slept great. The built-in air pump is a dream as well
I purchased a Coleman Exponent F1 Ultralight stove this past spring in preparation for a trip to the Cascades in Oregon. I have owned a liquid fuel stove for years (MSR Whisperlite purchased in approx 1992), and have loved it, but as I am getting older, I have been wanting to trim my pack weight down. I have found the following advantages to the F1 Ultralight.#1. Easy to use. Simply unscrew the burner head, open the pan supports, screw the burner head back down, screw stove onto canister, light match, twist valve, and you are cooking with gas.#2. No priming. The liquid fuel stoves required priming, and pumping, which made them harder to use than I would have expected. With this stove, you simply turn the valve and light. No waiting for the generator to heat up.#3. Very light weight. The stove assembly itself weighs less than just the small fuel bottle for my liquid fuel stove alone. This thing is a feather on the back.The disadvantages are there as well.#1. Canister stoves rely on the low boiling point of the fuel to force fuel vapor up and out of the canister, and at temps close to, or below the boiling point, which is close to 0 fahrenheit, the stove simply will not work. For me, where and when I camp, this is not an issue.#2. Fuel cannot be used as an emergency fire starter. #3. Fuel is EXPENSIVE compared to white gas, or unleaded gasoline. The owners manual claims this stove only works with Coleman Brand canisters, but I have found that any threaded canister of 70/30 Butane / Propane blend works. I have used Brunton, Coleman, MSR, and some odd black Canister I bought at a gas station in Oregon with it, all with excellent results..Compared with other canister stoves such as the MSR Pocket Rocket, Brunton Optimus Crux, Snow Peak Giga Power Stove, or Primus Yellowstone Techno Trail, the Coleman Exponent F1 Ultralight had the design that made the most sense to me, sported the lowest weight (.4oz lower than its nearest competitor), and from what I was able to determine in impromptu in store testing, appeared to have the best pot stability of the group, with pot supports that spread out nice and wide. One tidbit about this however is... The Evernew 1.3L Titanium cookpot, is oddly shaped on the bottom, and sits and a slightly odd angle on the F1. I have tried many other pots and this is the only one I have a problem with. The issue is whith the oddly dimpled bottom of the Evernew pot, and NOT with the Coleman stove...SUMMARY. If you camp where the temps aren't freezing, low weight, ease of use are important, and cost of fuel is unimportant, then this is the stove for you. However you must carry some other sort of emergency fire starter in lieu of having stove gas to start wet wood. If however the cost of fuel is going to be a factor for you, or you are going to go mountain climbing, or whatever, you will want to bypass any canister stove at all, and just go with a gasoline model instead. The Coleman F1 Ultralight is the lightest of the group of stoves I had considered, had the best design, and came in at a price point that I liked. For the majority of backpackers out there, I would say this would be the best stove for you.
I bought this toning ball so my girlfriend and I could work out together. It's a little heavier than I'd recommend for small women but boy do you feel it when you're done!
Yankees MLB Cap , Fits Most People, its a slick slender Apparel, with the MLB Logo on the left side. A true Authentic cap. It can  be worn any given Yankees Home games. Its a all natural navy blue cap with the white NY symbol in front. It has an adjustable velcro strap to fit it to your liking. Also an already  curved shaped brim for under 30 dollars with fast shipping and handling. Only the true Yankee fan will appreciate it's look and Major League design.
Hey if you are thin and you are on gym you should use this product, it raelly goo
It gave me a lot of energy and I was able to lift a noticeable amount of weight on my first work out using the product.  I also noticed better and faster results from using No-Xplode.  I like it
The two most respected bodybuilding supplements are (1)Whey Protein and (2)Creatine. They are also considered natural products or food products. While whey is without a doubt extremely useful, creatine does not help everybody. I have used creatine monohydrate in the past and I found it to be useless. It was so utterly ineffective that I just felt robbed of my hard earned money. My tub still sits in the cupboard. I have never used any other supplement products other than the ones that seem to be on the safe side as these both are. I heard about NO-XPLODE from some bodybuilders who seemed to think it was probably one of the best supplement products to come out in years. I researched it and it appears that BSN has formulated a surging "Creatine + Nitric Oxide" drink that seems to work with most people. Not everybody sees results but this stuff worked for me and that is what counts. Although NO-XPLODE contains some serious chemistry (see below) and possibly some debatable compounds (Guanidino Propionic Acid [GPA] and Glycocamine) it is probably well worth the very low-level risks for the results. 40 minutes after taking this stuff I can either cardio high intensity for 30 min flat (maybe even more) and complete a full range of compound weight lifts in the gym without feeling any interruption in my power. No fatigue. The surge is exactly as it promises. You will feel that you have nitro pumping around your body. It sets in at about 20 minutes for me. I feel a little woozy at first, disorientated, then my brain picks up and my body feels energetic. Put it into action and you will see results.  It also boats a CEM3 type of creatine that prevents you from bloating up like monohydrate does. I never have stepped much outside of what is considered safe but in my opinion NO-XPLODE is standing on the fence saying I am about the best bang for your buck without any serious side effects. So far this stuff is getting very good feedback. Yes it contains lots of mind boggling ingredients, but if you are looking for the creatine edge, even if creatine has never worked for you before, then NO-XPLODE is probably the one. It can also help build muscle, but even if it doesn't for you, it is still worth it for the surge. I am very glad that I got it. Very.

it is very good luggage carrier to withstand the weather conditions - since i used it in the trip when i started it was raining n not drop of water could enter through it and i was worried since i had all my clothes packed in it.it is very convient to install n uninstall with enough capacity to fit your things in it
The large display is nice. The altimeter and compass don't seem to hold their programming and need to be recalibrated ofte
First off, let me start by saying that I really like my Summit watch.  It is large (some may go so far to call it HUGE) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist, and quite comfortable to wear.  Those with bad eyesight will STILL be able to see the easy-to-read digital readout of the time, barometric pressure, altitude and compass.  The numbers are quite big, so they are difficult to miss.  The altitude reading measures in increments of +/- 1 foot, which is about as good as you can get.  I like that.  But what I really like about the Highgear watches that I haven't seen in other brands which offer similar features, is the visual image on the face of the watch telling you what the weather conditions are or will be.  No kidding, this watch will actually show you whether or not it is sunny, partly cloudy, or raining.  Pretty dang nifty if you ask me.  The barometric pressure reading is only a small part of predicting the weather, however after months of use, I have to say that my little watch is WAY MORE accurate than my local TV Weatherman.  I'd say somewhere around 75% of the time what my watch says is exactly what the conditions actually ARE.  Not bad.  It's a feature I would VERY much like to have on my Suunto and Casio models with similar functions.  Until then, I'll rely on my trusty (and much cheaper) Highgear Summit.If you are considering making the purchase of a wrist watch that offers the digital compass, altitude and barometer functions, before MAKING that specific buy, do some homework and wherever possible, seek out a store where you can actually SEE the watches in person.  Being able to guess the size of a particular model using a picture on the computer can possibly mess up your purchase.  Find the best price, and pull the model out and actually TRY IT ON before you buy.  For me, the Highgear Summit was a good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but in a smaller package, try the Highgear Axis, or possibly the more stylish but much more compact (and WAY MORE expensive) Suunto Observer.  Either way, doing a little homework will pay off in the end.  Happy hiking and I hope this helps you in your efforts to buy the right product.  Good luck
Just like the ones used in college intra-murals, excellent stitching and look to be very durable.  Fast shipping, and great deal
My 24 month old son loves this bike - it was fairly easy to put together, and works well.  Thanks
My middle school daughter was always struggling to fit her books in her old backpack which, up until this year worked fine.  I went on-line to find the roomiest one I could, and still get style, color choices and outside pockets. We were amazed at how much room this had inside.  Now all her books fit nicely, and she loves the extra pockets so she can easily find her lunch, pens  pencils, her cell phone and other 'extras'
I just returned from a 20-day trip, and this new backpack went along. It is comfortable, commodious and just the ticket. I have a 25-year-old JanSport backback (still ticking, but a bit tattered) that I have used and used, and I expect this one will provide the same service. It's great
I have ridiculously large books and a half hour walk to and from the train station each day.  Unlike every other backpack I've tried, the straps of this one have yet to start ripping or fraying apart from the bag.  The only feature I miss is a buckle connecting the two straps across the front of the chest, so they don't pull apart at the shoulders.  However, the bag is heavy-duty and roomy, and I'm easily able to fit my laptop, Con Law book (maybe the largest book ever made), Crim Law book (2nd largest ever), and pocket dictionary.  Overall, if you can get as good a price as I paid for it, I would recommend it to any student or other user..
backpack just what I expected, and I got it really quickly.  THanks
The Power Glove is a great replacement if you hate wearing a chest strap. They always hurt my chest so when I saw this I ordered it and I am glad I did. This is so much easier to wear when I go for my walks or do the stair stepper
These were a little smaller than expected so if you have really big hands look to see if you can get a bigger size.  A little tight at the wrists, but these have great padding and serve me well
I've been kicked out of two country clubs for using the Butthead Golf Club Cover, and it appears the only club that allows my membership has been Playworld Putt Putt. There's also no dress code involved there.Now, on to the review!I strongly endorse this Butthead Golf Club Cover because it adds an element to golf that would otherwise be forgotten: fun! Those teets really help my handicap like you wouldn't believe. Many clubs have a problem with this cover, because they're incredibly elitist, but when I think of golf, I think of cow teets, and that's why I refuse to play without it
I used mine for two weeks snorkeling in Hawaii. It isn't perfect. It does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface, but it isn't enough to cause any problems.It is pretty easy to clear by just giving a hard quick blow. You probably won't find anything better
Excellent quality; much easier to put on than the cap I used before
This swim cap is easy to use and thick enough that I can't imagine it ever ripping or tearing
I bought this hiking pole to take geocaching with me. It's sturdy, lightweight, and retracts for easy storage. It's also nice that it absorbs shocks. A good product for the money
Looks like this is what I need for short hikes.  A little on the heavy side, but good for day hikes
Just like the ones used in college intra-murals, excellent stitching and look to be very durable.  Fast shipping, and great deal
I got this gear bag and love it.  It doesn't have a lot of the features you'll see in higher-priced bags; its really just a durable mesh duffle bag, but its great for someone who has a lot of gear they want to carry, and perfect for couples who just want to tote their fins, boots, masks, snorkels, and any other small gear like defog, gloves, knives, wrist compasses/computers, etc
I have used the bottle to take tasty beverages with me on the road, while playing sports, to drink while I am in class.  The bottle washes easily in the dishwasher.  The narrower profile fits easily in cup holders.  I highly reccommend the N-Gen.  It is much larger than 24 oz.  If you fill it all the way to the top you have nearly a quart of capacity.  It is the best functioning and looking drink bottle on the market.  You can also use the bottle as I have to pack small items which you want to be slightly more secure while traveling by air and also keeping some items out of the rain in your backpack. 
I bought this croquet set late last summer for backyard get-togethers with the neighbors. None of us had played before, so we didn't need top-of-the-line, and the price was right on this set. It's everything it needs to be: weighty, colorful, and compact in its case. The widgets are pretty bendy, but if they bend out of shape, they bend right back. Turned out to be a good investment. A word of warning if you have small dogs: put them in the house before you let your neighbors loose with mallets and round projectiles. My little dachshund picked up the bad habit of chasing the balls and pushing them further off-course. It was funny, until she darted into the path of one bright orange ball, which made solid contact with her little head. (She's fine now, but is no longer a fan of the game.) All in all, I would highly recommend having a set like this around if you have the room in your backyard and fun neighbors
Hey can you please tell me when the next platinum timberlands are going to be in stack
I don't usually select items by name brand, so I tried many other boots before I tried the Timberlands.  But none seemed as well constructed or was as comfortable.  I have had them for 4 months and they have proved waterproof (in rain and puddles, thus far) and have shown very little wear
Timberland's are in no matter what the season.. I mean you can wear them with a pair of khaki shorts in the summer or all your tight winter gear.  You know you can't have just one pair or one color so just go ahead..get them
Some people talk trash on this gun, and on how it's not upgradeable. First of all, if you can find a better gun for 85 bucks, I'd be amazed. Second of all, for just .89 cents, you can buy some teflon tape, and wrap up the hop-up receiver, boosting you another 70 fps. Search online for tutorials. Second, There is a tightbore barrel out, which will boost you only about 20 fps, but greatly increase your accuracy. UTG also has a drop-in cylinder upgrade coming out. So, there are upgrade, they just require manual labor, and you can't just buy them ready to go. If you're willing to put time into your gun, it'll be well worth it. I love this gun. I'm shooting abou
I have been practicing mixed martial arts for four years,and I have gone through all of the major glove brands. In my opinion, Everlast has always provided gloves that provided the most effective wrist support, which means less twisted wrists, especially for beginners. Everything else is well done, but not exceptional - it's comfortable, and provides durable padding, although I myself have only used the 16 oz. versio
Assembles easily and doesn't take up much space.  The quality is good, but I don't think it's strong enough for heavy use.  It's great for small workouts in front of the TV, though. 
I didn't know what to expect, but these turned out to be very good quality.  They stretch well and return to shape.  They don't feel like they are going to snap apart when you are in the middle of exercising.  I was very pleased with the product.  Be careful, though, if you have a latex allergy.  I also got excellent service from the company!  I would definitely do business with them again
Of all the many Swiss Army Knives I own, this is the most used.  Not only is the Pocket Pal small enough to easily carry in a front jean's pocket, its simplicity makes it perfect for quick use for fruit peeling, paper cutting, and a whole host of tasks
This step is great.  It really adds variety to my home workout.  I use it on carpet and it really stays put.  It doesn't slip on the carpet, and I don't slip when I step on it.  I was a little worried because it didn't have a rubber stepping surface, but it really doesn't need it with regular athletic shoes
I have arthritis (psoriatic), diabetes, high blood pressure, heel spurs and Osteopenia (a pre-Osteoporosis state)and I'm 240lbs. A real grab-bag of conditions to deal with! I saw what happened when my Mother broke her hip and I really didn't want to have that happen to me. But, how to exercise? Using a warm "therapy" swimming pool was about the only exercise I could do and that will not provide the weight-bearing exercise needed to re-form bone. Just walking around is cheap, but I'm a female and my neighborhood is not really well-lit and has gone downhill a bit, too. I just didn't feel safe walking around at 2:am or whenever *I* was up for exercise. Besides there were hazards like uneven pavement, high curbs and all the issues of weather to deal with. I had seen the ads on TV for the Gazelle line of exercise equipment and it seemed to be ideal for me. I could exercise my knees and hips in regular gravity conditions or add resistance if I needed to, without any arthritis-taunting up and down impact on my joints. No more worries about where I was stepping and into what. I could exercise whenever I wanted and not disturb anyone in the neighboring apartments. I could go as "far" as I liked and wouldn't have to worry about being exhausted from going too far from home and not being able to make it back.So, I got the Gazelle and I LOVE it!I chose this model (The Power Plus)for my use but also because my best friend is 340lbs and this will take up to 350lbs. From the way it is constructed - which is very strong and SOLID, I'm not sure that's really it's upper limit. This is not some flimsy, cheaply constructed rip-off.  It does not move, sway or "walk" when I use it. Yet, with the handles on the side, I'm able to lift the back of the Gazelle up onto the front wheels and move it fairly easily, which really suprised me since it is such a heavy-duty machine.Any downsides? It did have a small bit of squeaking at first, but it never got to the point where I'd be worried that I was disturbing anyone. Because it is built so solid, it does command a bit of space. Not too much, but it is not a model that will fold up so you'll need to commit room for it and enough room for the swinging motion. I'd want to safety-fence off around it to protect pets and kids from getting too close when it's in action.Over-all I am VERY pleased with this item!Well done, Fitness Quest
I bought one of these, based from a review. I pretty much agree with her, the machine is great and it gives a good workout. But she forgot to mention, the thing can cause your feet to get sore! I tried wearing high quality running shoes and it still hurt. I received an advice to attatch foam strips to the runners that you stand on, and that has solved the problem! So far, I have not used the pistons, so it's just a cardio workout. I have Tony's tapes he sells on his website and his music cd's, and I do get a very good workout! I have lost 13 pounds so far by using it, and I noticed it defanitely toned up the buns
There's not a lot of information out there on using this extractor for cars, because I think most people buy it for boats instead.  So I'm going to talk about how well it works on changing the oil in your car.In summary, it works great.  It's really nice being able to change your oil on your own time and at your own home without getting dirty.  I'm never going to Jiffy Lube again.  It even works great on my lawnmower.Using the extractor is very easy.  Just remove your dipstick, insert the extractor's tube into the dipstick hole until the end reaches the bottom of the oil pan (it might take some practice to get a feel for this part).  Once everything is in place, pump 10-20 times.  This will cause a the extractor to suck out the oil like a straw.  It takes about 15 minutes for 3 quarts.  That's also why I recommend the 6-liter model instead of the 2.5-liter one, so that you can suck out all the oil in one shot.Some people wonder whether all of the oil is removed this way.  Unfortunately, I can't really speak to that, because that would require me to open the drain plug and investigate.  However, the consensus from stuff I've read on the Internet is that the extractor does remove as much oil as the traditional method.Because changing my oil is so easy with the extractor, I always change my oil on time.  Previously, I drove for thousands of miles past my "due date" because stopping for an oil change was too inconvenient.  The extractor should be used after the engine has been running.  The oil is less viscous and the contaminants are stirred up, making the extractor more effective.Also, please remember that your old oil must be properly recycled.  Most mechanic shops will accept your old oil (I put it in a plastic orange juice container), just call ahead to make sure
Works great. Used it to drain the oil in my 2005 VW Beetle TDI
The plastic side mounts (4) appear to be solid and not flimsy.  I replaced the 12 supplied screws with actual stainless steel ones, (you know, since this is going on a boat!) But at least the hooks to attach the cooler are stainless.  The package says "includes all stainless mounting fasteners" So I guess that means hooks only.  The supplied screws are not even galvanized. So if you plan to affix these mounts permanently to a boat, go get stainless screws that are also 1/2" longer than the ones provided.All in all it's a nice kit but a little pricey for what you get
First off I need to tell you that I've carried a swiss knife since I was a kid. I have most of the styles. But this one stands out as the absolute most useful for a rather strange reason. For me since I don't fish I found more uses for this in the most unexpected area. The "fish scaler" tool is one that I would NEVER use to scale fish for no other reason than the problem of having to clean it thoroughly, too much work. But this tool I have used more than any other on all my knives. I've used it to open ceiling hatches to change office lights, pick locks. to measure things (something you need more often than you think), to reach into thin areas to clear debris or push a switch and most of all as a back scratcher. Since there are no sharp edges on the scaler it's perfect to scratch those areas one can't reach. That's not to ignore all the rest of the tools this knife offers which I use except for the absurd "parcel hook". This tool is useless and yet Victorinox continues to install it on many knives. The only useful task I've found for the hook is to tighten one's laces on my boots when I snow shoe. Anyone else found something useful for the parcel hook? Please post it if you have
I love the look of this mat. Love the pattern and colors, but it is a bit thin. I just layer it on top of my old mat
This paddle is a bargain here at Amazon.  Sports stores would easily sell this for over $20.  Having said that, I found it to be slightly heavier and the thicker sponge made it difficult for me to adjust my game.  "BUT", I still eliminated many a younger player at our men's retreat.  There's nothing better than seeing the face of a 23 year old when a 53 year old kicks his rear!  Thanks, Stiga
I recived the paint quickly and it as in great condition. I only had 1 bad ball in the whole pack of 1000
the taste is not bad. u can drink 2 glasses and not get sick of it. i gained 5 pounds in the first week of using it. i went from 140 to 145 using n-large 2, eating a lot, and working out.
Even without the great looking box this product is well worth the money, but with the box, it is almost a work of art(of course some stain in the bare wood would help). This cleaning kit is a must for any collector of Japanese weapons
These bands were recommended by our son's summer camp and we were quite skeptical about them.  But they seem to be working very well and are comfortable to wear.  Our son likes them much better than the sprays and smelly lotions that we used to use and never really worked.  Before using these bands, his legs and arms were covered with bites.  We are very pleased with them and highly recommend them to others
After polishing alloy wheels I treated them with Boeshield. It leaves a waxy film that attracts dust and dulls the finish, however there is no sign of tarnish or oxidation. Very easy to clean off when you want really bright wheels
This is a great bike.  I gave one to my 2 and4 year old to share for Christmas.  It is winter here so they ride it through the house all the time.  My son has really struggled with 2 wheel bikes because the typical bike easily crashes when you turn the handle bars too hard.  This bike is made so the turning radius is very small. The bike is light enough that he just picks it up a little to make a big turn.  No problem. He goes sailing through the house now with NO crashing.  Once the weather is good enough to go outside he is going to have a ball.  He will definately graduate to a standard bike after this teaches him balance.  He should be able to skip the obnoxious training wheels altogether.   My short 2 year old loves it but she has to go slowly because she can barely reach the floor.  In a few months she should be fine and I'm guessing by this summer she'll be sailing on it.   GREAT FUN.   Unfortunately the price is very hard to swallow.  I found one on sale through a design website so I could manage it.   If the money won't bankrupt your budget or you can save for it, it's worth it
This is the second Vector I have purchased.  My first six year old one has gotten beat up and the compass no longer works.  The watch has a large dial and is a little bulky, but you get used to it.  You trade that for a large easy to read dial.  The watch has more features than you can use and a large instruction manual to go with it. It has the compass, barometer, temperature, and altimeter.  The 6 hour barametric pressure history box is nice to warn you of incoming bad weather.  The watch is a nice instrument, but I would warn against abusing it. It is shock resistant, not shock proof
This may be the 'outdoorsy' ubergeek watch. It's big, it's ugly, but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy. Overall, I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are. The timepiece: Outstanding. It has HH:MM:SS DD:MMM, of course, with a year setting to avoid leap year issues. This should go without saying in a modern digital watch. Stopwatch with lap function (not that I ever use the lap function, but I'm sure someone is interested). Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown (very easy to set). Three daily alarms. Special kudos for the alarms, this is one of the loudest watch alarms I've heard, and I've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this. The Altimeter: largely eye candy, but kind of neat. Over four days, my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level (by the maps, about 40m ASL). Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer, and I never recalibrated it, but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it. The Barometer: Yup, it's a barometer. The part I like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend, especially as this is always active (even in normal 'time' mode). The Thermometer: Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist. The compass: Easily the best 'special' feature. Accurate, precise (enough for orienteering, not for surveying), easy to use. It can be programmed for a declination, but knowing me, I'd forget to reset it, so I do declination the hard way. The sighting notches are small but servicable. The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto, and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass. An outstanding wrist compass. The package: Big. Really, really big. But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing (a problem for me with other watches). The battery has a shortish (12-18 month) life, but has a hatch, so you don't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance. The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground, and the display light is just right, readible, even, and glare free, but not an emergency flashlight. Personally, I'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap, but the stock strap isn't bad, just not great. Overall, not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch, compass and barometer, and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter. Well designed, thought-out, and manufactured, but really big.

I purchased the Kwik Kik for my 11-year-old to use as a training aid for the recreational soccer program he is involved with.  It was fairly easy to put together and, once the base is filled with sand (it cannot be filled with water), it's simple to move it from place to place.  The Kwik Kik is a great way to build up the strength and stamina in his feet and legs!  I love the fact that he can use it either in-doors or out-doors, so he'll be able to use it to keep training throughout the year.  Great Product
Very high quality/durability. This glove works well as it should. Only complaint (splitting hairs here) is that it gets pretty hot pretty fast, and your hand will sweat. If you are an extreme sweater, you may want to sacrifice the quality construction of this glove for one that is more well ventilated.
I've owned my first pair of "Big Grip" gloves for over three years now and they're still in great shape (for a time I was lifting four times a week).  I only bought a second pair to keep in reserve in case Harbinger discontinues them.The only down side for me is the finger length.  The glove's fingers, at least on my hands, end right at the second joint and are mildly annoying when you bend you fingers until the gloves break in.  After that, though, they're great
If you are a power lifter and often tear your skin with regular lifting gloves, then these are for you.  They offer the most support in the areas that I need it, then any other glove I've tried.  A++
We purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the Keys. The DVD gave her a good overview of how to use the mask/snorkel. The mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out. This was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for.
I thought the speedsafe was a button that you press which flings the knife open.  I was dissapointed to find that it is just a spring that helps it open faster.  Other than that, this knife is ultra high-quality, definately the best I have owned
I hate to feed into the mentality that causes knifemakers to hype their blades as "tactical," because the last thing we need to give lawmakers is another excuse to heroically protect us by banning the tools we carry. But the first and last thing I have to say about the Ken Onion Tactical Blur is that it is one fearsome knife.A curved blade would be suited to your usual cutting and slicing applications, such as skinning mastodons and so on. This knife, on the other hand, has a chisel-like tanto point, which is ideal for thrusting effortlessly through beef ribs or car hoods. It would be equally at home cutting up cardboard boxes, linoleum flooring, or metal garbage cans.Technically, this isn't a switchblade. Switchblades are bad. We know this because our lawmakers have heroically protected us by effectively banning them at various levels. This is only an ordinary liner-lock knife with spring-assisted opening. But if I ever found a switchblade with the deployment speed and cutting power of the Blur, I'd say it was quite a knife.The blade is shaving-sharp from the factory, and the handle is lightweight but sturdy aluminum with some kind of gritty sandpaper-like stuff glued on to give a better grip should the knife become slippery with any sort of fluid. Use your imagination. I haven't tried shattering any cinderblocks with it yet, but it's sturdy enough to use as a yawara stick in a pinch.Folded, the whole package can be palmed even in my small hands and feels much like a disposable lighter with a glandular problem. I don't even notice it in my hip pocket, which is where it rides whenever I happen to be wearing pants. If walking around with something this fearsome seems too naughty for you, remember a couple of things. One is that you can buy it from The Wall for $55, and The Wall would not sell naughty things to naughty people. Another is that crimes, to my knowledge, are not generally committed with knives like these, but with such evil implements as kitchen knives, screwdrivers, and whatever happens to be lying around near the crime scene. Lastly, you will probably not need a knife this fast and ferocious, but if you do, you will *really* need it. And you'll have it
I had my knife for 10 years, and would still have it, if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever I leave the house. One night I was heading for a flight, at the airport, going thru security; when I realized I had it on me, I had no choice but to throw it out. So had to get another one
As an intermediate player, I have been highly satisfied with this racquet
Quick shipping/ but poor packaging. There was obvious chips of metal from the structure in the packaging and one of the main SCREW and BOLTS pagackages were already open (lucky i found all) Bad packaging BUT EXCELLENT bench. It takes a decent bit of assembly but it fit perfect in my 2 car garage and still lets 1 car in. Great multi-function product. You can do all core lifts and also do lats and curls to build the minor muscles for definition. Pretty sturdy structure but seems a tad bit hallow (no problems yet) for a hundred fifty five bucks with free shipping (another 155 value) It was REALLY worth it. I say to anyone who likes it, its worth it. Just get it. Wether your a pro or beginnger its good for getting stronger and adding mass
I bought this bike after not riding since I was 14 (32 now).  The box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled.  I also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out.  Overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town.  I'm not a trail seeker, so have never tried it off road.  Very happy with the quality and ease of assembly
The bike was delivered 70% (rough guesstimate) put together. It was relatively easy to complete myself (only had to use manual a few of times) and i'm certainly no expert.The only problem I encountered, was getting the front brake pads to align properly on the tire. With that being said.... I spent a few dollars at our local bike/cycle shop to have it looked over (basic tune-up service) to make sure it was safe to ride.The bike now rides nicely and serves as my cruise around town bike. Overall, I think this is good value for the money... but only if you're looking for a hybrid type bike for shorter (more casual) trips
If you want classic jump ropes for your kids, get these. They're so durable. The kids love them.
I take power or ashtanga based classes 3 times a week.  So when I travel on business taking a mat along isn't the best plan.  So I purchased these and when I traveled they were great on the hotel carpet.  I read some of the other reviews that they aren't durable and I don't think these were designed for everyday use.  Regardless, I love them for travel or when I can't make it to the yoga studio
I am saving this until this summer!  I can't wait to use it
The one I bought is green and black - looks good in the water. I first look this kayak (dingy really) out into the Gulf of Mexico. The swells were two two three feet and the harder I paddled the behinder I got. I thought I had made a bad purchase but then I took the dingy into Clearwater Bay with much calmer waters and I'm having the time of my life. Paddling is slow going - 2 to 3 miles per hour at most but I've gone a couple of miles and back all along the bay. I bought a Coleman pump that runs on 4D batteries and I can inflate and deflate it five times before I need to change batteries. This kayak is the best $70 I've ever spent. Great exercise too
The pedometer is just too sensitive!!  It tends to over state the number of steps that I have taken. I like the item but I cut the number of steps that I have taken by third.  So, if I am tageting 10,000 steps a day I try to go 13,333 so that I can be sure that I really hit my target. The item itself is well made, light weight and easy to use and set.  
I've purchased 3 tubes of this brand.  The product works as advertised.  I have bigger thighs and use it to prevent chafing while I'm walking around at work.  This product is especially a lifesaver during the hot summer months.  There are other brands on the market, but this is far the best value I have found.  Thank you Sportslick, keep making your product and if it's not selling, find different distribution channels
It is very well made. Works very well for our use.We are into model rockets.We keep our motors in the box.Fills our needs great.Steven Rushin
This is a nice sword for $35 (plus tax). When I removed the sheath, there was some sort of goo on the blade (probaby so it wouldn't rust). This is a carbon blade, so don't leave it in a moist closet for 1 or 5,376 years(by then the rusted blade alone will be worth a fortune). Just dont get the blade wet, ok. You can rub a moist towel across it to get rid of the rust protector if you're going to use it often but that is pretty much all you can do to clean it without a special kit. Please dont brandish this sword around like a bad actor in a kung-fu movie. You could realy hurt someone with the point of the blade. I think this is shipped over seas, so dont challenge your friend to a violent battle the day after you buy this and you should be fine. Blue Dragon is actualy a japanese video game that no one bought. I think it was based on a part of final fantasy 2. I don't want to bore you with video games, so i'll get to the point. Put it on display, dont cut your lawn with it, dont play ninja with it, and dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try to cut a solid object in half with it (prefrebly a tin can) because the cheap blade could fly off the tang and hurt you (or prefrebly your neibor) in the face. Please don't throw the blade at your neibor either. P.S. I am not neil meislin, I am his son, daniel meislin. If you can't understand my numerous perenthesis, I guess you're not smarter than a 5th grader.
I Bought this sword on the 25'th of december. Got it on the 27'th of December. Paid for standard shipping.Amazing delivery time! the sword is amazing too!Thanks for the great product X-Bows, i will be coming back to you soon
I absolutely love this watch, and amazons fast and reliable delivery of the product didnt hurt at all.  I mainly got this watch so that it would be easier to orient myself if I was lost or giving direction via the compass but now that I have it I wouldnt know what I would do without it. A Great Purchase
The dials/gages appear to be very good quality and look very nice.  They are very accurate as far as I can tell in comparing them to my LaCross Clock/Weather gage and the local weather reports and web reports.The Hygrometer may be off by 2% but am not convinced this is true as yet and I can adjust it.I set the barometer to +1.1" for my 1050' above sea level.I wish the clock was not a loud tick tick tick.  It is not that bad, but I would rather not have that at all as my ears very easily pick up on things like that.The one thing I do not like is that I should have checked the dimensions of it.  I am not sure if they were listed when I bought it.  So check the size of what you think you life before you purchase.  This one seems a little small.  Not the gages but the mounting board.  It could be a little wider and a little taller.I also, somehow messed up on buying one that had such a boring mounting board.  I would have liked a beveled arch on the top or such.  The wood is good quality and the varnish appears to be top notch.  I don't mark down for this.I mark down for the size of the mounting overal as it could be taller and wider.  Not buy much, but maybe an inch wider and 2' taller.Overal I like it alot.  I just did not realize how plane jane it was in mounting and size.
The Ultrastar is a classic disc, wonderful to throw and catch.I personally feel that Ultrastars vary based on the color, but I just may be imagining things.These fly better than the average Whammo, although I feel that I can throw 180g Innova Pulsars a little bit further. Still, the Ultrastar has more curvature and has a nice stable flight pattern.I've thrown the Adidas 175g as well, and while that is not as bad as a beat-up whammo, it's still not quite the same
You owe it to yourself to own a flashlight made using the Cree XR-E LED.  It's roughly TWICE as bright as the currently comparable Luxeon LED.  Also, the "regulator" circuitry keeps the light at a fairly constant level through the life of the battery (not all LED flashlights have this feature).  It's small enough to be put on a keychain, yet puts out a powerful beam
I already owned a Fenix P1 which amazed me with the impressive light it threw from something so tiny.  It was easily small enough to fit on my key chain and so it is always with me.  Even a great light source is useless if it's not accessible when you need it.  I owned a Surefire Ultra which is a great flashlight but obscenely expensive.  But you could feel the quality and knew it would last a few decades.  I love the rear clicky button design and the 5 levels of light.  I expected some similar design elements in this new Fenix. I was disappointed to see that to switch to the different settings you have to screw the collar left right, then left right again and so on.  So if there is one setting you use most often, you must go through the whole 5 turns just to get back to it next time.  Come on, that's just stupid.  I will keep it only to avoid the exchange hassle and it still is a good value considering the size and light output especially compared to the uberpriced surefires.  But there is no comparison as far as construction or quality. So 4 stars is all I could muster for the crude setting selection method design and the adequate but toylike feel of the casing construction. 
I bought one of these lanterns three years ago at the local discount store.  I have used it numerous times on camping expeditions.  It outputs very bright light at full blast.  The lantern is quick to light and the best part is it does not require matches.The only three issues I have with this lantern are:1. Sucks the propane.  I also have the coleman fuel lantern, and while it is not as bright, it can go for a week of camping on one tank (5 cups) of fuel.  2. Loud.  This lantern is loud when burning.  The above mentioned lantern is much quieter.3. Construction -- the fiberglass (?) base around the knob has disintegrated from my thumb rubbing it when trying to light the lantern.  Hopefully this will not affect the longevity of the lantern.I'd recommend it if you are looking for convenience and bright light, but if you are looking for value, go with the old dual mantle coleman fuel (pump up) lantern. 
If you are out in the cold and its important for your hands to be warmed then you need these hand/pocket warmers!They are even great for just being outside for a walk!  I have poor circulation and MUST keep my hands warm to avoid pain and these warmers do the trick
I was/am a runner who constantly was sustaining leg injuries of one type or another.  I finally yielded to the fact that I needed to seriously cross train and reduce my running.  I decided to row, however I abhore having to spend tons of cash on exercise equipment to work out indoors when running is virtually free outside.  I originally wanted to spend only a few hundred dollar so at least I could get my work outs in and see if I really liked rowing.  After reading every review I could find, I decided that it may be in my best interest to spend more than a few hundred dollars.  When I chose the Body Craft VR100 rower I figured that I would still be compromising quality since it was a mid-priced unit.  I didn't want to listen to things click and clack, and have to tighten things that would loosen over time. Much to my amazement, this rower Rocks!  It was really easy to put together, the parts are high quality, and the important thing is when you row you don't even think about the fact that you are on a machine.  It's solid, steady, smooth, and a great workout.  I use it 4-5 days a week for 45 mintues each time and have had it for about 1 month.  It feels just as good as the day I bought it.  If you are thinking about purchasing a rower, I highly recommend this one.
I just love my little Parrot!  The kids on the bike trail love to hear it too
I ordered these for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them, he says that they are better than any that they have at his gym.  Very durable and only moderately padded, great for the price
This is the Harbinger you need unless you are going to be power lifting only then I suggest you look into the 12xx series but they are for very quick lifts and not for wearing more than ten minutes because they are like wearing boxing gloves. If you want to spend time in the gym lifting say the big three like squats, deadlifts and bench presses for a couple of sets then the Harbinger 140 Pro WristWrap Glove is exactly 100% what you need. I would never, and I mean never, buy another glove again simply on the bases that every other type of glove I have used has split within two months of use while Harbinger just lasts through deadlift upon deadlift upon deadlift and looks as good as the day I bought them. The wrist strap is a really nice touch, very long and wraps around and around to keep those wrists nice and firm for the big lifts. You go to the gym and you want a pair of gloves that will support you and last longer... look no further. Buy them
The Firm just keeps getting better and better!  They're products are WONDERFUL!  I've been using The Firm videos for a looooong time and I LOVE them!!  The cardio-weight training does wonders for your body!  Now with the TransFirmer system, this is definitely a challenging workout - even for me and I've been an advanced exerciser for over 20 years.  I love the incline step...you can really feel the difference.  You can also increase the intensity or you can do it less intense as well. It gives you great variety with the height of the step, weights, incline, etc.  THIS IS AN AWESOME WORKOUT...I LOVE EVERY DVD!!  Very challenging and I'm am very happy I bought this.  The step is wonderful and very sturdy!  This is the only step you'll ever need...for all your Firm workouts!  
I would give this 3.5 stars if possible. Its a decent table, the chip holders/with cup holders are easy to rearrange accoring to preference. The Table itself seems to be a piece of plywood, with some green felt tacked both sides of it; and slots cut out for the chip trays. It works, but could have been a nicer, better made product for the money. Watch out for the shipping costs,  almost 1/3 the price of the table. Pretty expensive
For some reason the electronic control panel doesn't work on my bike.  But I don't mind too much.  The bike is small and light but has enough mass so it doesn't slide around.  I use the bike while doing work, watching TV or reading.  It's a great way to get exercise on rainy days
The kids at our church campout had a great time with the Aerobie SkyLighter Lighted frisbee's we bought for them.  They took a pounding and one spent the night in the pond and still continues to work.
I am not an exercise person.  But, I need to keep moving and others in my family have bone issues that mean they shouldn't exercise in a manner that stresses the joints.  This machine is perfect for all of us.  I put the machine together and found it to be quite sturdy and fairly heavy.  The electronics on it are working just fine.  It's the kind of exercise machine that I can get on, watch TV, and forget I'm actually exercising
The product works as anticipated.  I was disappointed that the packaging was missing golf tips that were advertised as being included.  This advertising was imprinted on the product's box so it was not just a stick-on label afterthought.  I think someone tampered with the box before shipping
...or shall we shag later?  Now if they could figure out how to tee the ball up for me I wouldn't have to bend over at all!  But seriously, I find this product to be a vast improvement over the old shag stick that I was using.  I haven't used it on real grass though, just on the practice mat and net I have set up in my garage.  Given the consistent way the Shag Pro serves 'em up, I think it would also work fine out back
This is a good jogger if you will be using it for more than just jogging.  I really like the fact that it has a front swivel wheel that you can lock for jogging and unlock if you need more manuverability.  It comes with cup holders, which is nice because a lot of joggers you need to puchase them as an accessory.  Overall it is a good stroller, the only thing that I would change in the design would be the wheel locking feature.  It has 2 individual locks, one for each wheel.  The jogger I had previously had a bar across the back that would lock both wheels at the same time when pressed.  I am extremely satified with the stroller for the price at which I purchased it
I bought this stroller after much research and deliberation.  It is comfortable for my [...]as well as my [...]daughter.  It handles wonderfully. It folds pretty well too.  The front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature. I am tall and it helps to have the handle where I need it.   I have used this for both walking, shopping and jogging and think it is perfect!  From purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days.  I am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase.  I love this stroller!
This is a great tennis bag with good space. Fits 3 racquets easily and several separate areas. I love it
I'm not an expert on footballs, but I haven't seen anything wrong with the way this one is performing.  It's easy to grip and throw, and it doesn't have that cheesy "hey I'm a recreational football" look to it.  Good deal for the money
I bought this product to use during my camping trips. I had a minor issue with my order but was corrected immediately, great customer service. This is a really neat hammock, it packs really small but is very resistant. My friends loved it when they saw it and it was really easy to set up. You will enjoy it whether you go camping or on your backyard
TOO LONG FOR 5" TALL PERSON. I HAD TO MODIFY IT FOR MY WIFE. ITS THE SAME IDENTICAL CHAIR AS AB LOUNGER,ABLONGE CAIR ETC... SAME MANUFACTURERE. IT HAS A STICKER ON IT THAT SAYS "WATCH FINGERS WHILE FOLDING YOUR AB LONGE 2" ON IT. SAME COMPANY,SAME CHAIR. EASY TO MODIFY 'DRILL OR SAW' EITHER WAY TO FIT SHORT PEOPLE.  GREAT PRODUCT WIFE LOVES IT. OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS BUYING THEM NOW. 4 STARS NOT 5 DUE TO ME NEEDING TO MIDIFYING IT. BUY THIS ONE SAVE MONEY INSTEAD OF ABLOUNGE. 
Had this device for 3 months, absolutely love it! The chest strap you must wear in order to detect your heart rate takes a little time to adjust to, but it is very accurate. The most useful feature offered that is not included in many heart rate monitor devices on the market is being able to keep track of the distance you ran, the speed (max and average), and calories expended. This allows you to control your pace while running by speed, or because some days your body may react differently to exercise and may fluctuate; you can change your training accordingly with the heart rate monitor function. You are also able to easily program the watch so that it will alert you once you've reached a target heart rate, or time, or speed, and even resting rates, laps, etc., essentially letting you program your interval training. Distance is very accurate once calibrated manually. Never owned a gps based heart rate monitor before, but I chose this the gps based hrm because I need reliability (according to some reports on gps based hrm, the gps signal is weak when running in places with trees or tall buildings). Besides, if I get lost, I figure the extra running can't hurt me =
I really like the heart rate monitor and it works great.  As has been said, it takes some time learning all it does, but it's worth it in my opinion.  The only thing I was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit, but from what I have been told by others and their brands of running watches, they all do this to an extent.  Everything else I'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone. The distance reading has been right on the money after calibration.
If you are looking for complete information about the training or fitness activity and want to analyze to improve your performance or avoid overtraining this is the unit.- Very nice software, a lot of nice information very well presented- Speed sensor is reliable and accurate (does not suffer all kind of interfence such as GPS units) - error is really smaller than 5% even during long runs- The information available during and after the exercise is great (temperature, altitude, calorie count, all HRM metrics such as average, maximum, %)- Bike sensor provides speed, distance, etc- Fitness test is a nice measure of improvemen
LOVE this knife.  Looks great, sharp as can be out of the box.  Thin enough for the pocket of my khakis.  One disclaimer, use the safety.  It opened up in my pocket once (no clue how) and could have been dangerous
Great little knife.  I've taken to carrying it with me on every occasion my Native is too big.  Super sharp and keeps its edge even after some pretty heavy use.  Only beef is that it's a little hard to open and close with one hand because of its size.  I'm going to have to get the leek
Perhaps the best and most useful pocket knife you can have
I purchased this knife for about $4 cheaper than its usual Amazon listing price at Amazon's Friday Sale.  I had been looking at the Kershaw knives for awhile, and following an incident in my building's parking garage (woman accosted, pocketbook stolen), it seemed like the perfect time to buy.  The "rainbow" titanium-coating color might bother some men, but I'm a woman, so I don't mind the color of the knife. I would have preferred the black-on-black, but this was too good a deal to pass up.The safety lock looks like it might slip out of safety easily, but in two weeks time of regular wear/use, I haven't had a problem. I flip the knife open often (heck, it's fun), and I wear it regularly (what's the point of having it, if you're not prepared to use it?).  The thin attached metal "belt clip" is very sturdy and multipurpose (it looks similar to the metal clip on a writing pen). Not only can I clip the kninfe just inside my slacks waistband, but it clips easily to the inside leather pocket of my purse.  The single finger flip-open mechanism is beyond belief - very easy to use, exceptionally fast and accurate.  The locking mechanism (keeps the blade in place) is extremely solid, and has worked without flaw.  When I'm walking anyplace suspicious by myself, I hold the knife in the "ready to flip open" position in my hand, held down at my side.  The knife is nearly invisible in that position, so I don't stand out as "oh my God, she's carrying a knife!" However, someone intent on a criminal act just might notice, and avoid me altogether.  Great knife for personal safety.  Lastly, like the other reviews point out, these knives are SHARP. I don't use mine to open letters, boxes and typical pocket knife activities (I believe that would gum it up, and slow the opening speed of the knife), so I anticipate the blade should have a good, long life in my care. 
What can I say?  If you're a Steelers fan then you must have these!!!!
These were purchased for a client who has severe arthritis and works outdoors.  Our winters here are very cold and he found he had much less pain in his hands and fingers using these gloves
We got this as a family gift for Christmas. We love the red color, and it's great to have out at most holidays. The kids were so excited to roll it around, and hear the ice inside. They didn't believe it at first that it was really making ice cream. The anticipation drove them crazy. But it was fun for everyone. I fully recommend this product. We are a family of 4 with the mega ball. At first I wasn't sure if it would be enough, but we even had leftovers. And I love the fact that it comes with recipes for different flavors. I would give it 10 stars if I could
I bought one of these for friends that have children, and one for a friend who is married without children.  They all seemed to love it! 
We purchased the Mega ball and have made ice cream twice in 2 weeks. The kids think its great. It takes a good half hour or more, but worth it. Make sure you have a really good stiff plastic spatula for scraping the sides of the container, it can be hard to get off. Really easy to clean
I bought this net to accompany a Kettler basket I recently bought for my bicycle - and it fits perfectly - It was as if they were made for eachother...I can either wrap it around my basket or hook it onto my rear rack...6 hooks and a directional bias make it immensely practical..
Despite what the other reviewer has said, this table is great. I delpoyed to Iraq with this table folded up nicely in my duffle bag with no problems. The table is lightweight, and stirdy as long as you set it up correctly. I use it for my laptop indoors, but outdoors it works great as well (provided a hurricane isn't trying to blow it around) Overall, it's a great table that's compact and easy to set up and break down. My only complaint is that the plastic tabletop slats are thin plastic and if you have any heavy items sitting in the middle of the table it will bow a little unless you place the items directly on top of the support beams. I'd buy another if I had the need for one, and everyone in Iraq has complimented me on it because they're stuck trying to find ironing boards or water boxes to set their laptops on.
I work out at home using dumbells and a number of bodyweight exercises.  My dumbbell collection had grown cumbersome and messy, so I looked around for a way to organize these dumbells in my room, and this rack was perfect.  I did look at a number of racks both online and in RL, but the majority were way over my budget, had crippling shipping charges or were too limited in terms of their capacity to space ratio.  I was just about ready to fabricate my own when I found this on Amazon. After reading the reviews and crunching the numbers, I decided to give this a shot.  I'm happy to report this has completely solved my dumbbell storage problems. ***This rack arrived a couple of days before anticipated; with the use of a single crescent wrench, I put it together without assistance in the space of an hour or so.  Well within 2 hours of opening the box, it was in place and holding weights. It is solidly made of heavy gauge steel and quality welds covered in a tough tactile coating material.  The construction method is of simple carriage bolt and nylon insert locknut assembly. It ships with rubber coverings for the feet and all orifices.***The actual dimensions of this rack are 36.75" x 24" x 32" (W x D x H).  Add at least a foot to the height for the minimum workable usage space (for lifting the weights in and out).  I have filled it's available space with sets of 10-50# dumbbells in 5# increments.  For the past month, it has held 540# and remained absolutely rock solid.  From the feel of the thing, it could hold easily twice this weight without issue.***Highly recommended for personal use or even tight boutique space. 
Does the job.  Does not take up a lot of space.  Holds all my weights and is located for easy access during workouts.  What more do you want
My wife and I love this product.  Now, it's not for backpacking, but it does work great as a car camping or base camp stove.  It does require one of those disposable propane tanks (which can be tough to dispose of), and it might make sense to get the carrying case (not seeing it attached here).  But besides that, a great, simple stove which can be used in all kinds of conditions
We bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since.  We just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way, and she just wouldn't part with it.  My husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night. (Almost 22 months old).I was so disappointed to see that Fisher Price doesn't make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby, but the prices people are asking here are outrageous
my baby doesn't go gaga over it, but she does like the moving picture on the ceiling occasionally.  it's a great product, though, so don't depend on my baby's tastes
We purchased 4 sets of fins and masks for a trip to Jamaica. We were very happy with the US Divers product. The price was right and the fins worked just as expected. They worked just as good as sets we have rented. Rather than renting fins at the beach, we now have sets to use the next time we travel to the ocean
I bought this for when I work on my car/motorcycle in my apartment building's parking lot. The lighting is poor, and I've found headlamps to be an absolute necessity.I bought this one because it seemed to have the properties I was looking for- a wide, even swath of light for close-in handy work. After comparing to several other lights on a site that is easily findable by searching for "flashlight reviews", I decided on this one.Having bought it, I actually wish I had gone for the Princeton Tec Quad. The thing is- this headlamp is extremely bright. It has two buttons to select the light output- one chooses between using all 8 LED's, 5, 3 or just 1. The other chooses between full output, "dimmed" output, and a flashing mode. Even with 5 LED's on the dimmed output, there is plenty of light for me to see what I'm doing. The reason I say it's *too* bright is that with 3 AA batteries, it's kind of heavy. Basically, I wish I had went for the Quad, which has 4 LED's and traded off the excess light output for something lighter and more comfortable
This item is such a great value.  Everything included is a basic necessity.  For anyone interested in getting into boxing, I suggest this set as your first purchas
I just read the other reviewer's comments.  Yes, the bag isn't huge, but it certainly gets the job done.  It's not the over-sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks, but it's a bag that has style.  That's why I got it.  It's a bit more european in its design, and is of good quality.  I dont expect zippers to break anytime soon.  Look to be good quality.  Also, at this price--it is such a good deal
Great product has a nice spin.  (_)(_)=====D                                     
i use this radar "gun" to see how fast my shot is in lacrosse..it works perfectly..there is no use in buying one over 200 dollers...i mean, its a radar gun...it is worth your money:
I used this for paintball on my military simulation A-5. I see other sights and I was worry about this since its cheaper. The red and green dot is MUCH more visible then my brother in law more expensive BSA also. About the manufacture website, it is a 40mm. Dont know why they said 30mm. But like some sight, the lens (both front and back) are both 40mm but theres a inner tube that control the up/down/left/right of the laser and it decrease the viewable area just slightly. Overall, it worked great. I can tease/tuant my teammates with pinpoint shots near them.
Estos son los guantes que mas me gustan para nadar. Mucho mejores que los aqua sphere. El asunto es que duran poco. Despues de unas 50 idas a nadar, ya estan muy rotos y hay que conseguirse otros. Tambien hay que tener cuidado con el tamao. Yo tengo manos grandes y solo me sirven bien el tamao medium. Por el resto el producto es muy bueno, y comodo.
I'm serious about acqua aerobics and the upper body workout I can get by using these high-resistance water gloves. The unique velcro closure is a great improvement over other types which were a struggle to get on and off. Wish they had a "Medium" choice of size. They only make a S and a L. These gloves were a great find and the price was right
This is my 4th pair of aqua fitness gloves, my 2nd pair of this exact Speedo Aqua Fitness Glove.  Allowing the fingers to protrude through the ends of the gloves is a great benefit.  With other gloves, water builds up inside the glove and, if lycra-backed for example, the glove becomes like a big balloon after a short while.These Speedo gloves allow the water to pass through the glove and out the finger-holes.In addition, the material the gloves are made of is much sturdier than other gloves I have had. The palms hold up well as do the backs.I recommend these gloves and will always use them in my water fitness exercises
Overall this is a great little knife.  It opens fast, is very sharp and holds it's edge well and feels good in your hand.  The liner lock is great.  I have used some others and absolutely hated them because they were so hard to operate.  This one is smooth as silk and located in a great position.  Very nicely designed.I did make a few changes which required going out and buying a torx screwdriver.  First,I reversed the pocket clip because it came the facing the opposite direction I was used to on my Spyderco knives.  Second, the safety had to go.  I found it slipped to the "on" position on its own so the knife did not open when you expected it to and was hard to disengage quickly.  Not because it was difficult to operate, rather it is tiny and hard to find blind.  If you like the safety though, it definitely does  prevent the blade from opening accidentally.Speaking of safety...the knife arrives razor sharp.  I opened my package and promptly sliced a finger badly enough to leave a scar.  The tension that the blade is under requires some force to overcome and gives it a different feel when closing the knife from a regular lockback.  Be sure you fingers are nowhere near the blade.  I am now in the habit of disengaging the lock and closing by pressing the back of the blade against my thigh
First off this gun shoots a mile !!!  I hit my friend in the head.  It left a welt the size of a 2 quarters!!!!!!!!!!!  If I was you I would bey this gun!!
This gun is pretty good but im not sure about the power being 300 fps and the battery takes too long to charge.  Although the clip only holds 30 rounds, the gun is deadly accurate and very powerful when charged long enough.  But please do not buy this gun for use as a sniper because the scope is a piece of s---.  I recommend blowing it up.  Anyway to answer that person's question the cocking handle is just for looks.  Now back to my review.  The scope does not have red crosshairs as i've heard people say and the sights are much better although you should tighten the screws.  The foregrip on this gun is awesome as you can fold it up or down and is not too wobbly in the down position.  Overall this is a great gun and I would highly recommend it to any airsoft player and plus it's only $30
I purchased two chairs, one for me and one for my husband. For me the chair is perfect. I weight about 110 but my husband who is about 270 it is not so good!! (Chair is way to small for him) I love it for myself because when I take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories!! I would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places
When I used lighter, less dense mats they would sometimes bunch up or move around during flowing vinyasa practice.  If my toe caught the mat, the edge would flip over and require adjustment.  Also, they did not cushion very well.  In addition, lesser mats wore out quickly and had to be replaced.  When doing poses like the side-arm balance, my foot would slip off the end of the regular length mat and I would fall out of the pose.With the extra-long manduka mat, none of these issues is a problem.  The mat is solid and dense, and stays put on the floor no matter what I do.  It cushions really well, but because it is so dense it is no problem to balance or move on the mat (not mushy).  I beat the daylights out of these mats and they still look great.  Durability is outstanding, and they show no signs of wearing out.  Ever.  The extra length allows me to move with confidence, knowing I won't run out of room or slip off the mat.  An additional benefit of the long mat is that it allows you to change your starting position on the mat somewhat, so that the small area worn by your feet is not the same every practice.  In other words, you can spread the wear over a larger area to make it last even longer.  The surface is plenty sticky for normal yoga, and if you do a hot yoga class or sweat a lot you will likely want to have a towel anyway.  No complaints about stickiness.As for weight, it seems that if you are big enough to need an extra-long mat you are probably plenty strong enough to carry it around.  It ain't heavy, it's the best yoga mat I've ever seen.
I've had trouble over the years finding ear plugs that would make a consistent seal against sound.   I've tried various types, including the compressible foam, but nothing seems to work all the time.   I use ear plugs when riding my motorcycle, under my full face helmet.   These plugs work great and are very comfortable.   They're also very easy to remove (not so the compressed foam, if they're just a little too far in).  I've had no problems with the ends touching the inside of the helmet and have since bought several more, including some for my riding buddies to try.   My only complaint is that the included case doesn't hold up to repeated use - the "hinge" just doesn't last - but the plugs have held up nicely for a couple of months now.     
i get frequent ear infections any time i get water in my ears. i took these to a water park and they worked perfect. They are very soft and wont make your ear sore
The thule 450 foot pack is quick and easy to install, fast delivery, On a scale from 1 to 10,this whole transaction is a 10+++++.
i have to say that i LOVE this mat. the combo jute and rubber make it nearly impossible to slip. only thing is... the jute and rubber are rubbing up against one another and kind of crumbling and flaking off where i often place my feet causing bald spots on my mat. haha. weird, huh? so now you know. other than that the mat is visually very pleasing
Better than any club shop product.  Perfect for the new golfer and light enough my son did not get tired carrying them for 9 holes
This watch/heart rate monitor is everything I wanted. I can get a heart rate in about 5 seconds by putting your index and middle finger on the two buttons on the top and bottom of the clock face, I havent used the other features yet, but appreciate not wearing a strap HRM anymore
I had concerns when I ordered this machine. Like the fact that I am so short. I didn't know if it would be designed for taller people. It worked fine for my height as well as my husbands height. (I am 5') I also had concerns because I have arthritis but I was able to do this without causing flare ups all the time and I am able to set goals and get a decent workout. I am able to adjust the machine to more difficult tensions so this is something that will last a very long time for me. The only drawback that I have found with this machine is that it hurts the toes a bit. Mine are starting to get use to it a bit. This machine is worth the money. I would highly recommend it to anyone especially those suffering with bone disease such as I am. It is a wonderful way to get healthier without compromising on pain
I got this trainer assembled in an hour with no problems.  It's a great deal for the price- not flimsy at all.  Perfect for at home needs
I received the exact item I ordered, and quicker than I thought I would get it.  The price was right, too
I purchased my Leki Nordic Walking Poles because I read somewhere that these poles would reduce stress on my hips and knees while walking.  That is totally true!  I have a congenital malformation in my right hip which prevents me from ever being able to run or jog as a means for exercise.  I do love to walk, but was hindered by the pain from my right hip.  By using the walking poles, I am able to walk quickly without any pain at all, even though I am actually using more muscle groups than I would if walking without the use of poles.  Walking alone, a person only uses about 50% of the large muscle groups.  Walking with LEKI Nordic Walking poles, one will use up to 90% of all the large muscle groups; this turns a simple 30 minute walk into a full-body workout without stress!!  I would not walk any other way now that I own my LEKI poles!
I own an older version of this net. It is about 10 years old and has been used once/week every summer.  It was used in a high level volleyball league, but it would be great for recreational use as well.  I paid $200 for the net and it is still like new.  I can't believe this is selling for $69.  GET IT NOW
I have been very happy with the hang-ups and have used them for the last month.  I have not had any issues and they look to be built very well
I got a pair of these boots for Christmas and even though I'm not sure what all they can be used for, they are great!  The construction is top-notch, they're  easy to use, comfortable, etc.  I seen cheaper boots on the market, but when I'm buying a product to let me hang upside down a few feet above the concrete/tile floor in my house, I want the best product for the job.  ;
Our card group of ten people play "President" which requires three decks and a large table.  This unit makes it easy to pass the decks around the table to whoever's turn it is. I added a teflon furniture pad to the bottom and we can easily slide it from one end of the table to the other
Good machine - excellent price - purchase  shippingBut remember!  You gotta get on the thing and do the work
Excellent product don't hesitate this big umbrella is the perfect one to protect you and your equipment when rains start
This is a better stroller than the other three (all for one child) strollers we have. Very maneuverable and adjustable. It turns on a dime and seats adjust up and down independently. Folds down very quickly. It's great that the kids can sit next to each other.
Bag is easy to carry and lightweight.  It is good for carrying gym clothes to school. Bag is somewhat hard to open
I bought it through the Target -Amazon store, which was cheaper than the same product through other vendors. Its very easy to assemble although you may want to play with the chain a bit to set up the desired tension (by shortening the chain to belt connection which can get chain grease on you a bit).To me it was exactly as advertised, a long rowing machine that is not too quite but far less loud than expected and works well. I do not fold it away after use but its a nice feature if you want to move it to another part of the house and dont want to lug an 8 foot long device
We have used more expensive "professional" grade ergometers that would have cost at least three times as much and we are very pleased with how the Integrity compares for a home version.  Assembly and operation are easy, the equipment seems well built and the noisy breeze generated by the wind resistance wheel is very tolerable, allowing conversation or TV viewing with only moderate volume increases
Highly recommended!!!! My wife uses this pack for nursing school.  As you can imagine she carries A LOT OF "STUFF".  This pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school
Pros: 1.great compartmentalization everything is easy to obtain (if you know where to put it). 2.Lots of room able to put just about everything in it. gym clothes, several text books, laptop, camping gear, etc. Cons: 1.its bulky, even when nothing is in it, its bulky. if your one who likes to show off your back or want a sense of style this is not the product for you. Tip: to make less bulky, put more stuff in bigger compartments relative to smaller compartment.2. THe shoulder strap strain resistant doesn't quite work...i'm consider myself an average male, strain works in about 25lbs. if you want less strain i'd go for the Targus or Wenger brands.Conclusion: if all you want is lots of space to put ur stuff w/o the style involved this product is for you
I love my Jansport Odyssey backpack. It has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack I have ever owned or tried.  I have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack can't be beaten for tranporting books.  A little more padding in the straps (or smaller textbooks)would make it perfect, but it is still better than anything I have seen out there.  I would highly recommend it to any high school or college student
 I thought the DVD was excellent from the standpoint of a person not having much experience in lifting or exercising.  It shows great technique and form.  I used to be a wrestler in the highly competitive state of Iowa so over the years I learned many of these pushup and workout techniques.  Pushups and dumbbells used to be my main source of lifting and staying in shape.   I found myself to be too advanced for the Power 10 workout  so the video seemed like common knowledge.  So for beginners and more advanced people looking for a great DVD focusing on developing proper form and technique this is an excellent DVD .  The DVD takes you through many different styles of pushups showing the proper form and setup.  It then does about a set of three of that style pushup to show you the routine in live workout motion.  With the DVD purchase I was hoping to find an exercise program, approximately 30-45 minutes long, that sets up a nice workout routine for people short on time.  I was hoping for a video that combines a variety of different pushups using the Perfect Pushup into a nice timed workout.  A workout that works my chest, back, arms, abs, and some cardio into a nice overall workout that is done in short time.    Something similar to a Tae Bo style video or other timed exercise videos.  The Power 10 Workout isn't that type of video.  It is more specifically a technique video that one can evntually combined into a workout of their own.  I recently wrote some emails to the Body Rev president suggesting the development of a video for more advanced people that provides a fast, effective workout routine that one could get at the gym, but can do at home in 30-45 minutes with their Perfect Pushup.  He seemed pretty impressed by the idea so hopefully BodyRev builds on this DVD like they have for their other products. 
As a man with nearly flat feet, this product has saved my legs.  While the quality and durability of this orthotic are similar to others in its class, what seperates it that SOF SOLE's CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING and THE WARRANTY holds true.  When they wear out within a year, simply send them back and you'll get a new pair.  You'll be purchasing several pair, feel great and wonder why you didn' do it sooner.  I've owned Sof Sole insoles for 7 years and I'll have them for 7 more. 
Great I love using this product. It goes good with xylitol too
GREAT alternative to sugar. The FDA clearly doesn't care if we become diabetic, so we have to care for ourselves. This is a good part of God's creation being used for its designed purpose. Plus, the company was quick to get it to me and it arrived as promised. Great experience. I will buy again
I could not believe how well this product works. It is hard to imagine that this is not a more known product in the market. You don't need much to make things sweet, which makes the dollar last longer
The fat Mouth clamp-ons were easy to install and withheld a 15 hour trip from Texas to Colorado and back again. They came off my luggage rack very quickly and when when we are ready to use it again, will be quickly put back on. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an attachment for ski rack to thier factory installed luggage rack.
It is the best backpack I have ever seen
This isn't a weight loss tool, it just helps to sweat off excess water retention. I have noticed a considerable difference using it with my daily workout!
This works just like the ad says. It is easy to use, is comfortable, and does concentrate your workout on the midsection. I am very pleased.
This product isn't a miracle product, but it does do a few things: it supports your back, it is comfortable, it does make you sweat (mostly on your waistline) and therefore does make you lose some inches and also detoxes you a little bit.   It's not a bad product overall, but don't expect a miracle... you have to do the work for this product to help you at all.  I do use it any time I'm doing an aerobic workout to enhance overall affects
My daughter just entered 9th grade and joined the tennis team. I have played badminton for years and tennis is a fun sport and about the only sport I will do with her other than walking or biking. I bought her this racquet because I wanted something easy for her, not too heavy, and reliable. The salesperson at Dick's Sporting Goods recommeded this one and I am happy to say that it has been great! She has been able to hit the ball and with some practice I can see her becoming more confident. In fact, the other girls on her team are always asking if they can play with her racquet! I have been doing alot of reading and the racquet really does make a difference; one piece is better and this is a titanium racquet. This racquet has great shock absorption; I have rheumatoid arthritis and will not play with a racquet that is going to leave me in pain. I liked this racquet so much that I just bought a second one so my daughter and I can play with the same racquet. P.S....it comes in a nice case...and the Wilson US Open Tennis Balls are an excellent choice for a match
We have purchased 3 of these tricycles in the past 2 years for our grandsons; 1 was a gift, but the other 2 are kept at our home as I watch the boys daily. The boys, ages 20 months and 3 yrs, love to ride them with the streamers flying and the bell ringing. I love them because of the way they are built. The center of gravity is set very low to the ground, making spills and tip-overs a thing of the past. The rubber wheels have a better grip than the plastic wheels of other brands too. (I had purchased a small plastic trike and the way the wheels would just spin in place was very frustrating to the boys.) The old-fashioned fenders on the wheels help keep little fingers from getting hurt and the wide step in the back seems to be useful when getting on or off. All in all, a great trike
This item was perfect for my son, who is advancing in skateboarding and tricks! 
Kids love this quarter pipe.  However, did not ship in a timely fashion due to amazon delay in ordering and had NO directions.  Luckily a friend had almost the same thing and we pretty much figured it out after a phone call to the company.  It did take a while to assemble
Ok so I read a horrific review but that sounds like a lemon of a stove. Our stove is great! We took it out for a trial run with 12 or so friends and what do know it performed flawlessly. The ignition was quick the cook temp was even and we had our coffee before many others using their Colemans. In fact several friends couldn't believe the heat this little guy produced. We love this little stove and will be using it for many years to come
I've been carrying and using these Swiss Army Spartans (or similar model) for about 35 years.  Bought my first in Germany and couldn't get along without it now.  Great quality and has just about everything you could want for daily use.  It's small enough and light enough that it's comfortable to carry.  Doesn't have all the useless "bell and whistles" that you'd probably only use if you were a 12 year-old Boy Scout.  Only problem (mine, not the knife's) is that I tend to lose one about every 6-7 years... so I bought 2 this time so as to have a replacement for the next time it grows legs and walks away.  Another great feature is the optional eyeglass screwdriver than can be purchased and fits neatly (via a threaded handle) into the corkscrew
I was really impressed with this Nascar sleeping bag.  I purchased it for my nephew who recently turned 5.  He's a big Nascar fan and he was super thrilled to have this. 
Gotta say I LOVE this Step and even more so the DEAL: Not only do you get The Step, but you also get FOUR raising-blocks *AND* a Step-workout dvd -- All for under $50!!! I think that's a bargain compared to buying the pro-equipment (I think it was $70-80 for the pro Step and $40-50 for two raising blocks, plus $15 for a DVD... that's, like, $140-150!).The Step *is* smaller than the Steps you're probably used to from the gym, BUT it's not *that* much smaller -- I would say it's about 25% shorter length-wise.  It's gotta be though, I mean it's an at-home Step so they're making it more storable.  I guess if you're a big person it might be a little frustrating at first, but I don't see how you couldn't adjust to it.  Then again, I'm 5'2  petite so for me it's the perfect size! haha :PThe DVD is pretty good.  It's pretty simple, basic stepping though, so if you're an advanced stepper you'll probably get bored real fast.  However, it does get you to sweat a little, so it's not a complete waste.  If not for the stepping, though, keep it for the abs workout -- OMG it's AMAZING!! For only 10 minutes it really makes you want to commit stomach suicide. haha  Which is a good thing because the next day your tummy is sore but FLAT. :)  But really, it's a good DVD, especially for those lazy days that you know you need to workout but don't want to (at least not too hard). LOLBuy this kit, it's a *great* deal and it'll get you in shape! :
I'm a single mother with a full-time job, taking part-time graduate classes are night.  I have very little time to myself, let alone any time to go to the gym.  I needed something that was fun and energizing to do at home, after my child went to sleep.  I found the PERFECT product!  I recommend this to anyone that wants to get a good workout in the comfort and privacy of their own home
These ropes are great for double dutch. They're very fast and long so you can do two people at a time. I love double dutch. It is a lot easier with these ropes
*****This is an upscale designer water bottle, top of the line, and so much fun. The designs Of Sigg's water bottles are gorgeous, from the plain, solid color bottles, to the ones with intricate designs. They are simply beautiful! I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns, thinking it would take more work to maintain. These do necessitate regular cleaning (I clean mine every day), but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun. Sort of like my rings, glasses, and watch, I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory, reminding me to drink more water, making a statement about my values, and expressing myself with a special design. Yes, all in a water bottle!Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality, made of light aluminum on the outside, slightly insulated, and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever, unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles. They are light, durable, and perfect for any activity. Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles, just like from the tap.Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops. I bought the screw top because I don't like sports tops, and I don't mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink. It is totally leakproof, which is important to me. The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner. I get comments on it all the time, "What's that? I love it!" The sports top version is ok; I just am not a fan, as I don't feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top. However, for convenience, you might prefer it. For children, there is a cap-type top. All are leak-proof. If you are ever unsatisfied with the top, you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle.Sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6L and 1L in this style. I have both. I use the .6L for sports activities because they are smaller. When I won't have to carry the container, I like the larger bottle. Sigg also makes a smaller .3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people. You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too, such as .75L, .4L (for kids), .6L, .5L. You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1.5L size, also. Search Amazon for the perfect size.Pick a style and pattern you like, as this bottle is a personal accessory, and should reflect your style. The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon.They are expensive, but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years. I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health, so they are well worth it value-wise for me.Highly recommended.****
LED headlights are getting better all the time. This little guy is a one Watt Luxeon LED with very good power regulation. Regulation means that the light gets the most from a set of batteries and keeps the light at a given brightness instead of dimming as the batteries weaken. The Princeton Tec EOS has three brightness settings and a flash mode. I actually find the flash mode to be too slow to be useful on the bike and it flashes at full power but these are minor nits. I'd also prefer if the light used AA instead of AAA cells. So I guess there are two things I don't like about this light.But the positives far outweigh the negatives. The light is small and is supposed to be waterproof to one meter. (I don't ride under water so I haven't tested that feature!) It's easy to operate and the batteries are easy to change. The light pattern seems to be just right for my riding. I use this light on my helmet but it also comes with a handlebar mount. I run the light at the lowest power setting most of the time and that's fine for reading my bike computer or cue sheets. The middle setting is better for general riding, spotting road signs and potholes and things like that. At the highest setting, you get the brightest beam but of course that eats through the batteries quicker.I'm pretty sure the circuit in this light was designed by Willie Hunt, a real guru in bike lighting circles. And yes, I'm enough of a nerd that I actually keep track of things like that. Anyhow, the Princeton Tec EOS is my latest favorite bike toy
We bought this bicycle for our son's 3rd birthday.  He LOVED the bright colors and the fact that it has somewhere for his horses to ride!  It has taken a little while for him to get used to the training wheels, but the bike stays steady while he is riding and doesn't threaten to tip.  We are very happy with this bicycle
This - along with a pogo stick and stilts - was my effort to get my kids offf the video games at least some of the time! I thought this might be too hard for the 6 year old, but he persisted and is getting better at it. The point is, it's so fun he keeps trying! The 13 yr old - and my 17 year old daughter are enjoying it too. There seems to be a trade-off between the stilts and the hit-a-way. Only the little guy can handle the pogo stick - go figure
   The suit itself is great, but the sizing is just way off.  I purchased    a large and an extra large for my kids; the large is actually too big   for me, and the extra large is enormous.  It is almost as though they    are sized for men instead of youth.  Hopefully they'll grow into   them . . .
Very useful stopwatch.  I like the mutiple functions. My use is for swim workouts.  This watch allows me to have three intervals going at once.   The print is a little smaller than it appears on the picture.  Not a real problem.  I am glad I bought this stopwatch over my other choice which could only time two lanes. 
It was a gift for my niece she loves it, she's only 7
Despite having some trepidation after reading the reviews of owners who had unpleasant experiences with the SG4, I bought it and am glad that I did.  My experiences using the SG4 during play have been very positive, even though on occasion the weather conditions have been so bad that I could only get a signal for some of the holes.  The large screen allows the user to easily see each of the obstacles on a given hole and know the distance to them and the distance required to carry them.  The SG4 also provides a more detailed view of each obstacle as well as the distances to the front edge, center, and rear edge of each green.  For golfers who like to know the exact distance they hit each of their clubs, the "MARK" feature is marvelous.  Being able to have all of this valuable information available for 10 professionally measured courses and 5 personally measured courses is of significant value for golfers who play a number of different courses not only on a regular basis but also for courses being played for the first time.  The SG4 also has a memory card slot for being able to download more courses when that service is offered in the future. I think the the downloading procedures on the SKY GOLF web site are somewhat confusing but not very difficult to figure out and use with only a few minutes of effort.  I know several low and mid-handicappers who LOVE this device, and I share their enthusiasm and opinion -- I am a high handicapper.  I also own a Bushnell Pinseeker 1500 with slope and consider the SG4 to be a far superior "tool" to the Bushnell. NOTE: there is at least one additional cost that buyers will incur after they receive their Sky Caddie -- the subscriber fee for downloading courses for 1 year.  The fees range from $30 for courses measured in one state that you designate to $80 for worldwide use
Probably the best cold weather gloves I've purchased.  They are warm without being too bulky.  I have not yet been in low enough temps where I needed to use the battery feature
Looks great, functions great.  Manual is a little daunting and a couple of the words on the display are very small.  I have 20/20 vision and I can't always read everything that is being displayed.  It is mostly in the Alt and Barometer functions where there is lots of info being shown.  Highly recomended
For those who may be new to Suunto, they are wrist-top computers designed and manufactured in Finland and are in use all over the world by Hikers, Bikers and outdoor enthusiasts of all kinds.  What makes the X-Lander stand out are at first glance, obviously its sheer size.  Let there be NO illusions, the X-Lander is a mighty big watch.  Despite its size, it doesn't FEEL as big as it looks, though.  The aluminum case is VERY light and quite comfortable, too.  The next thing you notice would be the HUGE amount of bells and whistles packed into such a small device.#1. An accurate altimeter.  This is an invaluable tool for the avid hiker and biker.  One thing you MUST be ready to do is remember to adjust it DAILY.  Find out what the altitude is and set the watch before you begin your trip, and then at the end of the day you need to make note of where you stopped (which you can do with the internal recording function) and properly adjust it before setting out the next day.  This is NOT a flaw, every single altimeter watch I am aware of is exactly the same.#2. Barometer.  I found it correct at least 75% of the time, which is more than I can say for the local TV Weatherman.  This includes a thermometer as well, which in order to be accurate must be removed from your wrist for at least 15 minutes in order not to get a false reading due to lingering body heat.#3. Digital Compass.  This is truly one amazing feature, by the way.  Once you calibrate it (which you may need to do weekly) you will NEVER be lost -- especially if you know how to use a map.#4. It tells pretty accurate time, too believe it or not.  It also comes with an alarm, a countdown AND a stopwatch.  Suddenly its size now makes sense, huh?  I happen to LIKE big watches.  I don't exactly know why, but I just do.  IF I were to have ANY complaint whatsoever, the one thing this watch is lacking is exactly what they have included in the much less expensive Vector: A tiny little bubble which helps you to level out the watch in the compass mode for a more precise reading.  The reason why may have to do with the fact that the X-Lander is mineral crystal and the Vector is plastic, but either way, it'd be nice to have.  I am VERY impressed with just about everything associated with Suunto and their fantastic line of what they call, Wristop Computers.  IF size really DOES matter to you, well you may wish to go with the Observer or maybe the X6HR (which does everything the X-Lander and Observer can do PLUS it has a built-in heart-rate-monitor) both are smaller than the X-Lander, Vector, Yachtsman and many other Suunto models yet still offers a LOT -- but keep in mind with the smaller size comes the bigger price.  Factor all that into your purchase plans and once again, if at ALL possible, do NOT buy until you have the chance to see some of these (or any) models IN PERSON.  That will make a HUGE difference in how happy your purchase will end up being...and good luck! 
The item arrived in a timely manner and its a quality purchase. Its keeps ice just like advertised. I am very satisafied with it. It has lots of room and is easy to carry with sturdy handles.LC
I recently got into gymnastics so I started looking for a leotard for someone with real curves. I'm 5'6'' and 180lbs and the XL fits me great. It has long sleeves which is great for the wintertime and I don't have to feel self consciousness about my fat hanging out there because it covers it up. It's cut low enough so that I'm not getting wedgies and I can do handstands without worrying if my workout shirt got un-tucked. It's not flashy so I don't look like a 10 year old in a fat 26 year olds body. It's nice and plain, gets the job done and I'm sure the others at they gym thank me for covering up for goodness sakes
This kit will not only help you get started, it will help you stay with the program too
This mat is a good bargain and perfect for the casual pilates partaker like myself. Rolls up nicely and the velcro should strap makes it easy to transport or store away. Good thickness and provides just enough cushioning so you can't feel the floor beneathe you. Easy to wipe down and keep clean
   My pain management Dr. said this was the best bike to pick with the least amount of pain I could choose
I ordered this bike on Monday and it was delivered on Thursday! The pictures of this bike don't begin to do it justice. It has a solid metal tube construction and a big padded seat. I am 5'9" and this beauty adjusted perfectly. It is very stable and whisper quiet. I was a bit skeptical when I ordered it but what a bargain!!
I bought this bike for my boyfriend for Christmas. It arrived in about 3 days, rather than the expected 5-7. We set it up on about half an hour. It comes with a small wrench that is perfect for the set up--I read an other review (prehaps on a different bike) that you need a cresent wrench, however for this bike you don't.He uses it every night, and I use it a few times a week. It's silent and nothing has broken on it as of yet...granted I've only had it for a month.I would definitely recommend this product
I knew I wanted a bowflex and couldn't decide between the models available.  This model offers the most range in exercises and still has the ability to fold up small enough to be able to set up a double air mattress in my "spare/exercise" room for a weekend guest. This product came in several large boxes and is best assembled by a two person team (A husband/wife team worked for us). This is the first exercise equipment I have been consistent with.  It is fun to use and takes no effort to change between sets.  I also have the Ab attachment.  Love it
I have used the Leatherman Micra for years, and thought it was time for a change.  The squirt is more money, but very handy, especially now because you don't have to open the scissors to get at the tools
The product itself is good and feels safe when I use it. The assembly instructions could use some help. But I eventually figured out what the pictures meant.
Working out used to be heh for me, but after getting the door gym I made a rule. Anytime I enter my bathroom (which is where it is suspended) either before or after I have to do 10 Pull-ups and 10 Neutral pull-ups, also since I purchased the broad-reach 10 of those as well. It's working wonders, within the first week of doing pull-ups where i'd use my legs just enough to complete the pull-up I'm now able to do 10 regular pull-ups. I'm very happy with this product, only downside (which I personally don't really care about) is that depending on what kind of door frame you have you could get some denting on the front side, the backside works just fine and leaves no marks on your walls. So anyway... I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and depending on how hard you want to work :P easy workout
i got this gun for christmas, and i just got the m14 sniper from pyramyd air. this gun is a very good beginners gun, and a great backup in an airsoft war. im a sniper/backup man, and this is my backup, i am very happy with the performance of this gun.pros-has a decent rate of fireelectric so it doesnt have to be cocked for each shotcomes with 8000 bbs (great deal)collapsible stockcons-small but manegeable magazineaccesories are sketchy,  laser broke t handle is very loose but helps stabilityaccuracy on semi auto is ok not good not bad if ur looking for a decent beginners gun, or backup like me, than i highly recommend this gu
USE THE XL MOST EVERY DAY AND FIND THAT IT DOES A FAIRLY GOOD JOB FOR WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. ONLY USE IT ABOUT TEN MINENTS AT A TIME SINCE I AM 72 I DONT OVERDUE IT. CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN MY ABDOMEN ALREADY
This item shipped very fast. The sandal was true to size and color. I am very satisfied with my purchase
The IZZO swing/grip trainer has worked wonders for my swing and grip.  The grip form helps train your arm to keep the face of the club straight.  It also helps to build muscle where you need it for a more powerful golf swing
I am so glad I finally found an online source for these visors.  I've been picking them up, one or two at a time, from street fairs for probably 20 years now.  You can see me wearing them in all my adult travel photos, because they are so light and comfortable, and they keep the sun out of your eyes (or the rain).  And these particular visors, here on Amazon, had good snaps, too
first of all i am not a kid i am a professional airsofter i own a classic army maruis and lots of other expensive guns. the best thing about this gun is that it is very powerful. the sight is really good and its adjusts. its also really accurate. the only complaint is its kinda hard to cauk. but its is also heavy which is a good thing most of it is metal my recomendation is whether you are a beginner or an expert this is a great gu
After reading the horror stories of the assembly process/instructions I was a little worried.Myself and my 12 yr old daughter put it together in about 3 hrs without issue. All parts were included, instructions were clear, she did the step check off's The base took 400lbs of sand vs the 375lbs stated in the instruction
After reading the previous reviews and noticed the bad comments about the instructions, I took that into considerations and purchased it anyways.Nobody was really talkin bad about the board.Most of us have the urgency of putting it together w/out reading the instructions and simply just looking at the drawings. You have to approach this one differently.I went ahead and borrowed a friend of mine and paid him with cold beverages because I defintely agree that you need at least 2 people to put this together.The Instructions although not as detailed did mention that you MUST READ THE ENTIRE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY to assemble this item, failure to do so can delay your assembly because you have to disassemble and re-assemble again.Finally, it took us 4 1/2 hrs to complete the assembly and based on my experience, it wasn't that bad at all. I only wish they added spare washers/nuts just in case you lose it.Once its installed, I added water to it and let me tell you. Its supposed to be portable but w/ the base filled, its pretty heavy.The board has a better rebound than other cheap boards out there but its not like the ones at the indoor gym. 50" is adequate for a home use, but you better have the apace for this. The base takes alot of room.The ability to move the height up/down is as advertised. I can do it with one hand. Very nice!!!I measured it from the rim to the floor and its accurate based on the height you adjusted to.One thing I found out just now. This "slam-it" rim, you are not allowed to hang on it or it will cause you your warranty. I know because Lifetime answered my question I emailed out.They do not have weight limits on these rims so do not attempt to hang on it. I defenitely recommend this if your shopping for one.
Great value - great taste for sports drink-fare.  This is the only drink I use these days on the trails.  Very easy on the system!  No bad after taste. The 4.5 lbs cans are an awesome value. 
This will keep the big little things from floating in your water. Only works in clear water.
I really like this mat by Hugger Mugger. The thickness is really nice especially if practicing on hardwood or tile floor. I actually purchased mine at TJ Maxx for $10 buck less than the selling price here. The color selection is very nice too. My one complaint is that I had to wash it several times to rid the mat of a chemical odor. I recommend using an organic soap or spray whenever washing a yoga mat. This one in my experience, needs to be washed  completely dried several times for it to have a fresh scent. All in all I say this is a fine product. However, the very best mat imho are Ecomats which are made from jute plant. Much more expensive than this one but well worth the price
Loved this mat! Great for taller yogis.great tickness too...A bit slippery but after a couple of sessions it wears offI totally recommend it! 
i bought the wave about 1 week ago and I got the hang off it in 3 days now I master the wave drill and high speed turns its worth your money        (Im 10 years old
Although my wife disagreed - I bought this for my son's 6 year old birthday.  It took him a day to figure it out well enough to jump on it from a stand still and get going a hundred yards or so.  Materials look reasonably good, it's light enough that he can cary it, and stout enough that I (dad) can also enjoy a fun ride.  I must say this is one of the coolest toys invented.  Easily 5 stars
I'm 26 and I'm having a blast on this board! It's much more accessible than snowboarding and surfing, because you can just grab your board and go!I take mine to a local tennis court for the smooth surface. They recommend using small hills and stuff, but honestly stopping or slowing down is pretty much impossible on a decent incline, so I prefer to stay on flat land. Its amazing how long you can stay on the board without even setting a foot on the ground! The board seems to be constructed fairly well. I've gotten to the point where I can some pretty advanced turns by shifting my weight effectively, its really fun trying to master it. I'm curious if the Ripstik (competitor board) is better constructed since its made by Razor, and they might have put more money into the design. Anyways, I've had mine for about 2 months, and the wheels are definately showing a lot of wear. I'll most likely have to replace them soon. I'm kinda happy that you can use any rollerblade wheels instead of some proprietary wheels. That enables you to look for good deals on some wheels. I'd also look around for the best deals on these boards. I got mine at a Sports Authority on sale for $80, after having seen one at an FAO on my visit to Las Vegas for $130.So, if you're a fun-loving adult who likes cool new ways of moving along,  I'd definately recommend this! It's addicting
I bought this for my 10 year old grandson. It is an unusual ride, took him a while to catch on, but he is really enjoying it now that he has mastered it
Love this backpack, it's been with me to numerous cities and countries and survives the trips very well, while protecting the contents well, laptop included.  The outside large pocket is larger than you think when you realize just how much stuff you can fit in there, and still fit under an airplane seat.  Love the two water holders on the outside. Love the zippers are a loop so you can attach a carabiner, compass, or whatever. The support is great, you'll barely feel its there, and if you do, just use both straps, and then strap the front for great support. The pen storage area could be larger to accommodate larger pens, but thats quite minor.My only con is that the outside two pockets have gotten stuck twice already. I am now on my third backpack(gotta LOVE REI's return policy). Hopefully this one will last as I have yet to find a better more complete backpack.  Update 1/30/2007 - Third backpack , third zipper to get caught, time to return, again. I wish I could change the scale down to 2 stars :
This is the best ab workout machines I have ever bought...and it works! I had no problem with the shipping or the actual product
I'm not really a golf player.  But what I saw of the golf set was that the bag's cover protection from rain has a missing zipper stopper
extra clips are neccessary! the gun goes through ammoand the clip only holds about 45 rds
For the price and relative ease of use, this is a decent starter net.  The five foot height/width makes it a little small for older youth.  It is easy to fold, carry and store, which is a huge plus - especially compared to other so-called portable nets.  It deploys fairly easily enough, though the support pole set-up is not completely intuitive.  The set I puchased had no instructions, so it wasn't until after several uses that I completely figured it out. All in all, however, I am pleased with it and would buy another should the need arise
I am very happy with my choice. It is just the right size, nicely finished with glossy black paint, installs in a minute. Usage is very convenient: it has that perfect click-into-place property: you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the "stand" position. To "hide" it when you are ready to go, just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame. It does the job perfectly and it feels great
It looks like a cartoon snail, and it makes a racket when you squeeze it.  I'd say it lives up to everything it aspires to be
I just got my poles, and while they seem great in other ways, they do not offer the Soft Antishock System as the description says they do
This gaget does actually work if used correctly. The last guy doesnt have any idea of what he is talkinga about. Simple theory, sweat more in the target area loss fat in the same area. Wear this when you work-out but all day along with a good diet and it will work. Several of my client have had excellent results
I've never been a fan of propane stoves. They always seemed flimsy, made for those toy-sized backpacking pots and pans and potentially dangerous - until now. After two weeks of RV-ing, the Fold 'N Go has become a welcome addition to our set up. It is very sturdy and seems extremely well made. The wide separation of the two burners and heavy-duty pot supports allow for two large, heavy fry pans and/or stock pots at one time. Few stoves of any kind can handle simultaneous large pots. And it seems very stable when set on a table.And because it folds in half and becomes its own carry-case, even though it handles such large tasks, it's easy to carry and takes up very little storage space. It also has an instant start feature - you just turn the nob and then press a button and that's it. You're ready to cook. And after you're done, clean up is a snap. Unlike other stoves where you have to take them all apart to try and get at that nasty, spattered grease, this one is pretty much all sealed - just take the pot supports off, wipe off underneath, flip the pot supports over to store inside and then Fold 'N Go!It's great to get cooking moved outside the RV - especially for things like frying bacon or cooking anything that gives off a lot of steam. And because our meals seem to entail usually one or the other, we plan on getting an extension hose off our main propane tank to run this frequently in the future.
This item arrived within a few days of purchase. It is a great value for the price. I did have to assemble it from pictures, but got it together without any outside assistance. I plan to use it along with the reformer I already own. I do wish that there was a CD or chart with basic exercises for this product. Their customer service was quick and helpful, when I had a component arrive damaged by the shipper
I was spending the day at home with a cold.  The doorbell rang.  At my doorstep, was a large box."Already? I just ordered it a few days ago." I shrugged on a jumper and hauled the surprisingly light (it's only 52 pounds) box up the stairs.  A sharp knife, a pair of nail clippers, thirty minutes and several small drifts of white packing material snow later, I had my Extreme Pilates put together.On first impressions, the mat graphic is cheesy, and the frame looks flimsy.  However, this isn't just a Pilates trap table:  the leg spring hooks are placed further back than they are on studio quality equipment, and are less likely to get in the user's way.  The push through bar won't drop if you let go of it, because the metal is engineered not to slide.  There are warning stickers to use the safety strap on the push through bar. Overall, this is a safer machine than the original.When you try to use it, though, there are a few problems:  I'm 5'4" and the mat is too short if you want to roll down to the floor.  The springs are light, and I would suspect that replacing them with heavier ones might overload the strength of the frame.  It's not clear which springs are the leg springs.  The lack of clips is just silly.That said, I can do everything I can do on a trap table.  I did the cat, swan and saw with the push through bar, leg circles with the springs, chest expansion and roll down with the bar, and even the magician's series to finish.  That kink in my shoulder that only goes away with the push through bar started to work itself out.  I could hear the springs (real springs, not bungee cords!)  All was (briefly) right with the world.  This is an amazing piece of equipment for the price. Three caveats:  Not for taller men; it's just too small.  Not for serious athletes; not enough resistance.  Not for people with children if you can't lock it away; springs are not safe for the little ones to play with.
I have had many backpacks for school and am always left wanting more space.  I like to have different places to put different materials.  This gives me the opportunity to do so.  I like the fact that I can put my Ipod in a section that is not likely to recieve the weight of the many books I use.  I would say that the area where you hold the smaller items, such as pens and calculators, is nice.  You have dividers where you can hold many different things.  Overall, this is the best pack for school I have come across
I love my Jansport Odyssey backpack. It has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack I have ever owned or tried.  I have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack can't be beaten for tranporting books.  A little more padding in the straps (or smaller textbooks)would make it perfect, but it is still better than anything I have seen out there.  I would highly recommend it to any high school or college student
This is the best, Jansport has always made an outstanding product. This is the third one I have owned. Plenty of room and just right size
My kids got these from Grandpa.  They love them!  They're fun to bowl with in a dark room.  We've clipped them onto headboards for a decent-sized reading light.The problems: The clip is pretty hard to operate, even for an adult.  Also, the plastic base broke on each of our lights (in different places), so now they're clip-less.  They're still well-loved and well-used by the little guys, though.  I recommend these lights, but be careful w/ the bases
With the birth of our first child, there were tons of little toys lying around all the time, from teethers to rattles, stuffed lovies and blocks.  The traditional toy box was too bulky for our small living space, so when someone gave us this adorable tote we were thrilled to see how much fit inside, how sturdy it was, and how much our baby loved looking at it!   With bold primary colors and cute scenes surrounding the entire bin, there is even a fold out flap with a play space, and a singing bird which attaches to the side basket.  The fun roof is all made of satin ribbons that resemble "shingles."  This was easily stored in our closet or taken along on trips.   Best of all, there seems to be no end to how much you can stuff inside!  It is soft and collapsible, yet stands upright and will hold just about all your small baby toys.  It can be VERY GENTLY machine washed, but we discovered it was best not to throw it in with anything heavy.  I gave one to a neighbor when her son was born and she still raves about how perfect it was for their baby's toys.  I give this 5 stars without hesitation; affordable and totally functional
We have had the 438 for over a year and it has been outstanding.  I started using an elliptical at the gym and still do but the convenience of having this at home is perfect.  Construction is top notch and the workout is oh so quiet.The workout monitor keeps track of every workout by user and has such features as fitness test, recovery and many workout profiles to keep you  challenged.What started out as a purchase for my use is now also used by my wife and daughter.  I guess they had to try it after I continued to rave about it.Time flies while you are on the 438.  Best of all this unit actually gets used.If you are going to buy one piece of home exercise equipment... look no further.
We looked all over for a quality dartboard with a cabinet, and this one was by far the best for its price. 
I've owned three pairs of these so far, and they're easily the best gloves I've ever used.  I had previously only used unpadded gloves, and the padding in the palm seemed a little thick at first.  The padding does make it more difficult to get a solid grip in some exercise machines that also have large rubber grips on them (lat pulldown bars, for example), but that's the trade off for excellent support and protection when using the gloves on machines with uncovered metal grips.  I found these gloves to be more durable than the other non-padded Harbinger gloves I've worn.  The gloves can be safely washed and air dryed, as advertised.My only complaint with regard to wear is that the unreinforced leather where my thumb meets the padding in the palm seems to wear out before the rest of the glove.  Every pair I have owned will eventually wear a hole in this particular area. 
GREAT SCOPE has good zoom and works good for 22. and super 9 air guns. Note that its dovetail and not weaver though Great Scop
Quick shipping - I received this bike in 4 days (using free super saver shipping) and it was even over a holiday!  The bike comes in one large box with MANY pieces.  My husband and father put the bike together in less than 1 hour.  It looked a little overwhelming at first but was quite easy to assemble.  The bike is very compact and easily placed in small areas.  It is also very quiet - you have to listen closely to even hear the bike.The resistance goes from 1 to 8 (one being the easiest to eight being the hardest).  My husband is an avid road biker and 8 could be too easy for someone looking for a really hard ride (like riding the equivalent of up-hill).The bike offers basic functions that are displayed very large.  The display is easily toggled through.  The heart rate monitor picks up okay, but don't buy the bike based off of that function because it's not totally reliable.All in all, a great buy!  I injured my back and was looking for a workout that would be good on my back.  The seat is uncomfortable (and I am petite- I would imagine it would be very uncomfortable if someone was larger.  But for the price, you can't beat it
Perfect, exactly what I expected and wanted. I ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up, had it on in less then 5 min. My bike is full suspension, 26 inch wheels with that horse shoe (U) bar on the lower legs of the front fork and it still fit with no problem. Don't know how it would handle a crash in trees though, sits high like a dirt bike look. People ask where I got it
The science is sound, but check it out yourself.  Police, military, etc., are using it, Fortune 100, other governmental agencies.  Schools should use it, if they don't.  It puts the kids into their best possible learning state.Seriously, 5 stars is not justice.  50,000 stars.  50,000 is the number of neurons directing your brain when you are in the zone.  The power the brain when "coherent" or not is tangible, and it's driven by the heart.  You can sense it in a person, anger, happiness, whatever.  It's the healing state.  It's the creative state.  It's where hormones balance. 
Compass worked wonderfully for my trip around New England this summer. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is for want of a backlight for night driving. Remember to moisten the suction cups before adhering to the window. I forgot the first time and it popped off 10 minutes later. Never came off again the whole trip after I moistened them.  Worth the money.
these roller blades are great they weren't to expensive and they are sooo comfortable they are fast and they are great to learn on and now i'm doing 420 to krooked grind to 270 out. I recomened to everybody that they should buy these and you will get total satisfaction the only bad thing about these blades are that they are a little ugly but they still work really well.
This gun is awesome! It shoots hard and fast. The battery pack was a little hard to get on at first, but it works.  Don't fire them in the house.  They put dents in the doors and blinds [they shoot really hard].  They bounce off the basement walls and really hurt, so go outside.  I did a battle with my dad and brother, and it lasted 2 hours.  It was great!  Now my dad wants one of his own
Sometimes this unit works flawlessly, other times it seems to have trouble picking up the signal.  I am not sure if that is a problem with this USB device, the Polar HRM, or the way that I am holding it.  In any event, most of the time it works and the data transfers quickly. 
This is one of the BEST weightlifting gloves that I have found so far!!  I like it so much, that I've bought a few pairs.  These have very supportive wrist wraps that are adjustable to secure your wrist during lifting - to help prevent injury.  The rest of the glove is terrific.  It is thicker around the palm and fingers, so it provides EXCELLENT cushioning for those heavy lifts. I have not had  one blister, or redness since I've started using these gloves, and I've been using them for over a year now.  They are extremely comfortable. After a year of use, my gloves are still in perfect condition too.  I've tried other brands, and the others tend to have thinner material around the palm and fingers,  and this causes redness and blisters, so what's the use of using them?  On the other hand, this Valeo Ocelot Wrist Wrap Weightlifting glove is perfect in every way!!  Has support, comfort, and it looks great. I have the orange pair (GLOW), and I get lots of compliments at the gym too about how great they look. Well worth every penny.  Way to go Valeo!
these gloves are pretty good gloves, if you're wanting to get started in boxing or working out with heavy bags this is the way to go. they are very traditional yet slip on design
There's not much I can say about this item. It works, and that's all I really care about. No leaks, it's never cracked, and it's stood up to some serious abuse.
These are brand new and brand name. I ordered late on Wed and received by Sat. Can't buy them any cheaper nor get them faste
if you are looking for a tank that is cheap but not a piece of [...] well look no further...this is the best tank ever. i own 3 of them myself andc wouldnt buy anything other than them
I have used this product now as a self supported bicycle rider for two years.  I am pleased with the product.  It's not real soft and fluffy like a thick towel but does a great job in absorbing water after a shower or stream bath and dries fast.  It's as practical as can be for what I got it for!  It also is very compact and light in the pack.  The one piece of advice I have is to not get a smaller version but go with the larger size.  The additional weight and bulk in nothing and having the additional towel surface is worth it
I have been battling hard since my cards arrived.  Thank you for such a great deal
My wife and I put this thing together in about an hour.  There was one cracked foot tread, but after calling Schwinn, we had a replacement within two days and no hassles.  If you are looking for a decent machine at a great price, this is a nice one.  It is fairly sturdy and has some nice preprogrammed workouts
We had in mind the type of exercise bikes we wanted.  We investigated several brands, models, and vendors.  The Schwinn 212 appeared to be the best value.  And, given the free shipping, Amazon had the best price.  So we ordered.  We were not in any way dissappointed.  Assembly was reasonably easy.  And the bikes are working out well for us
The Schwinn Airdyne is built to last out of steel. For upper and lower body workout, it uses a fan/flywheel to create resistance rather than a friction belt or magnetic motor; hint--fewer repairs and failures since there is no friction mechanism to fail.The onboard computer allows your to select what information you wish to see such as mets, calories, distance, speed, rpm and even displays your pulse if you wear a chest strap.  You can select miles or kilometers for distance and "club or home" for setup; hint--built to withstand use in a fitness center/health club. It even allows you to imput your geological elevation to facilitate a more accurate calorie count.Assembly is straight foward but does require a few basic tools such an adjustable wrench and phillips screwdriver.This represents a good way to go if you want a well built durable piece of equipment intended for serious use to achieve your goal of cardio-vascular conditioning, weight loss or just plain old exercise
I like this knife very much; it's size, shape, fit in the hand, and pocket clip are all just what I wanted. It has a nice edge and the Speed Safe assisted opening feature is fantastic. My only complaint is that the safety is placed in such a way that makes one-handed opening difficult with the safety engaged. I want the safety engaged because the assisted opening is so easy to activate and I don't want the knife springing open in my pocket. This is only a minor quibble, though. I do enjoy the knife very much; it is a good size to wear with jeans for light duty day-to-day use, which is what most people need a pocket knife for anyway. I use a different, larger knife for heavier duty use
I own several LED flashlights including 3 different ones from C Crane Company. This little unit from Garrity outshines them all.It is a bright far reaching light and the long battery life is impressive all in a light that fits in the palm of your hand.If you need just one handy convinient flashlight to carry with you, throw that old 3 cell mag light in the trash and welcome to the new age of flashlights
I am very pleased with this rack.  the only thing I do not like is that to install the rack you have to hand tighten it to your roof rack.  I would have thought they would have a quick release latch or something.  I guess I'm just lazy.  I reccoment this product
I got my trampoline for my 12th birthday and I was really excited. Though, as soon as I jumped on it, it wasn't bouncy at all! I am not very happy with this trampoline, and i don't reccomend that you buy it
We have a slightly sloped yard so I was hesitant about getting a trampoline.  We tried it, and it works fine!  My kids love it!  Of course, like any other toy, they take it in spells but it still gets used alot after 6 months.  I was also concerned at first about them falling off of it.  I almost bought the enclosure to go with it but I decided to wait and see how high they jumped, etc.  This trampoline is so small, they really can't get a lot of "air" so they don't do flips and other dangerous tricks.  It's also very low to the ground.  I am glad now that I didn't get the enclosure.  We don't really need it.  I would recommend this trampoline for younger kids.  The weight limit is 120 lbs so it can't support larger kids.  Also, since it is so small, we only let our two preschoolers jump together.  When we have guests over, it's one at a time.  I love it that my kids want to be outside so much.  This is better money spent than on video games, in my opinion
MFG by Northpole LTD, this roomy chair features padded seat and back for additional comfort.  Seating position is leaned back, lacking adjustment for more upright seating.   Fabric appears to be a durable rip stop nylon.  The arms are padded with foam, and I question foam durability over the long haul.  The chair could benefit from the addition of a cup holder.  Chair is rated at 225 pounds, and is close to 4 feet in length when folded and in its carry bag.  NFL team logo is embroidered on front and back of seat back and looks sharp.  Team name and logo is also printed on carry bag.  Overall, a comfortable, well constructed chair (with exceptions as noted) with an eye catching logo of your favorite team
I mainly get stuff like this because I like the looks, not that I actually use the merchandise that much. The knife seems sturdy and strong. The nylon sheath is high quality.
The display didn't work on the first rower we got, and one of the wheels on the front of it was broken.  Amazon sent out a new one the day I reported the problem, and helped me get UPS to pick up the damaged one.  The second rower arrived in good shape, and works fine.  The different programs are nice, it's extremely quiet, and my wife likes it better than the air rower we use at the Y.  The slightly padded seat is also a bonus.  One of the most important features for us was the heart rate monitor.  It comes with the chest strap, and displays heart rate on the LCD screen so you can vary your workout to stay in the target zone.  The heart rate monitor is not available on inexpensive rowers, and with some of the more expensive ones, you still have to buy the chest transducer separately.  Overall, quite satisfied with the rower, and because of their excellent customer service, extrememly satisfied with Amazon
Overall this is a very good rowing machine - quiet, takes up a small amount of space, and easy to use. My only complaint would be the LCD - the first order sent to me had a damaged computer, but Amazon was quick to send out a replacement rower which took care of the problem. Now every thing is great
We were having trouble deciding between this rower and the Kettler Coach.  This one was available thru Amazon, but the Kettler had to be purchased thru Merchantila, which has a horrible reputation.  So, we went with this model.I couldn't be more pleased.  Where it was manufactured was not listed, so I contacted Lifecore.  I had a response within 24 hrs.  Made in Taiwan, but don't let that put you off.  This is NOT a China quality product.  It's VERY sturdy.  Smooth and silent.  The preset programs vary not only in intensity, but time.  Some are 10 minutes.  Some half an hour.  Haven't tried them all.  Four programs are for you to set.Ordered it on a Monday.  Here by Friday.  My husband had it set up before I got home from work.  He did complain that the instructions weren't well written.  But he never complained about actually putting it together.  Must not have been too difficult.  All tools were included.You can also set your workout by time, distance, calories and strokes.While checking Merchantila's BBB rating, I also checked Lifecore's.  They have NO complaints.  That also helped us decide.I love this machine.  I'm sorry I didn't get a rower sooner
The Bowflex is one of the most amazing machines I have ever used.  With its range of exercises and a little creativity on your part, you can do just about any exercise you want to do.  I completely recommend this if you don't have the time to go to the gym or if you just really enjoy working out at home.  One disclaimer, don't think you can get the same results you can get from free weights.  If you are an avid free-weight lifter, you can get your kicks out of maxing the leg press and perhaps even maxing the bench.  The PowerRods have a tension that is proportional to the amount of bend you give them.  Thus, if you do an exercise with 100 pounds of resistance, but only move the power rods through their first half of bend, you aren't getting 100 pounds of resistance.  Also, when you extend the arms of the pulleys to do the wide grip bench, you decrease the amount of bend in the rods to the point where, even if you bend them all the way, you aren't getting full resistance.  Don't get me wrong, I love this thing; I've had mine for the past 2 years and it is amazing.  I work out twice a day for about 45 minutes to an hour each session, only because I don't have the time to make it to the gym.  Get this if you are very serious about workout out at home and don't have a lot of space to fit other equipment.  Make sure you have a positive attitude going into the lifting programs.  Experiment with ideas on different exercise movements.  More than anything, this piece of equipment is a blast to use, have fun with it
I'm a small person, not a bodybuilder and hated free weights.  However, I realized as I got older that I really needed to do some type of strength training.  I'd been thinking about a Bowflex and after looking at the literature, decided I wanted an Ultimate.  I purchased a used one and don't recommend that route since the seller lost some of the parts and delivered a damaged machine (long story).  I was able to order the missing pieces from Bowflex, but it took forever to get them.  Once I was able to use the machine, I absolutely loved it.  It's especially good for me since I'm usually alone when I work out and was concerned about injury with free weights or other types of exercise/weight machines.  Additionally, due to a neurological problem, I had little extensor function in one hand.  Using the Bowflex, I've been able to rebuild some of the muscle tone and would highly recommend this for anyone who needs physical therapy requiring weights.  I use this faithfully every day, alternating between arm exercises and shoulder exercises.  It's a pleasure to use and not at all tedious.  I think I probably could have done with one model under this since I never use the leg equipment.  Nevertheless, I'd recommend buying this item new from the manufacturer.  It's pricey, but well worth the money
I had one of these years ago and just recently purchased a new one I can say without hesitation that the product really works.  Its great for martial artists, particularly those whose arts rely on grabs, chokes, and need strength in the hands.These are also good for anyone needing general purpose finger strength, I havn't used one in ages but my friends still say I have some of the strongest hands they've seen and I attribute this entirely to the use of the eagle catcher
Good quality , well made hat with offical MLB sticker under brim.Well worth  4.99. 
It's more expensive than some, but it's well-made, works perfectly, and will last for years. Not requiring removal of the top to pour is great. Just buy it already
I've had my 1 quart Stanley Thermos for over 20 years now, and this is by far, no doubt about it, the best thermos ever invented. I have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate NY.  After leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in -20 degree temperatures all day, at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot.If you need to keep liquids hot, this is the best non-electric product out there for doing it
This product is excellent!  Very sturdy, durable and the videos are challenging but doable - from beginner to advanced you will get the results you're after.  I highly recommend this product
This very comfortable strap can be put around your wrist or ankle and when you do the exercise, you can just concentrate on the muscle you're working and not have to worry about the theraband slipping.  It's terrific
I bought this on somewhat of a whim because I've been wanting get a little more in shape (got a little bit of pudge going on) and I realized the hardest part of motivating myself to work out was actually getting ready and going out to the gym.. time was somewhat of a factor as well.  So I ordered this a few days ago because I read some reviews on here and it looked like the price was right.  Set it up earlier today; The quality of the parts is basically no worse or better than I'd expected.. think of it as a stripped down eliptical machine.  Setting it up was fairly easy but some of the instructions were a bit unclear.  Threw on some running sneakers and got on, and I've got to say, the feel/motion of this thing is REALLY strange at first.  Unless you are a ballet dancer or gymnist with really good balance, be prepared to look like an idiot on this thing for a little while because, like it's name, it is completely freestyle.  It's range of motion and rhythm is ALL up to you.  Have you ever been on a ski lift at a mountain and had the urge to swing your skis forward and back in unison just because it gives you that tiny feeling of being thrown off balance?  You might start unintentionally doing that for a few minutes on this thing (it's actually kind of fun but of course, there's not much of a workout factor doing it).  After about 10 minutes, I started to get the motion down.  It was pretty fun once i got the hang of it, but I agree with other reviews, it does make your feet sore... might try putting some foam on the footplates
Just 3 weeks ago, I came here looking at reviews for the Tony Little's Gazelle Freestyle, and read mixed reviews.  However, most were encouraging, and I thought it sounded like the thing for me.  I have now used the gazelle for less than 2 weeks, and have already seen results!This is no lie -- I lost 2 inches in the waist, 2 in the hips, 2 in the abdomin, and 2 in the thighs.  I'm just as freaked as you may be, but I'm telling you, this is the honest truth!I was discouraged that I had not been seeing any results on the scales lately, and needed to change things up, so I'd see something move again.  This gazelle did it for me.  At this time, I'm only up to 30 minutes a day, and 1-3/4 miles... I'm still a work in progress. But these results are no lie.  Just think how much results I'll see when I can stay on longer!  They advertise it as a low impact overall machine, and it truly is.  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Fibromyalgia, so I was looking for something I could do that wouldn't hurt me.  I can honestly say I get a full workout on this machine... oh, I forgot to mention, also 1 inch in the arms.  So, that's a total of 9 inches in 2 weeks.This is the best machine I've ever used, (we also have an exercise bike, and ab lounge, which I've not used in the last 2 weeks at all, cause I was getting such a good workout on the gazelle) and I'm so happy I found it.  And I thank you people, users of Amazon.com, for coming here and posting your reviews, and making it easy on me to know which machine to buy. Mine is the exact picture above, and folds up.  I also love that feature.  It's not a problem to just fold it up and lean it against the wall beside my bed after each use. Therefore, I've still got lots of walking space beside my bed.
I was a little skeptical about the Gazelle at first because it didn't look like you could get a work out from using it - but I was wrong!  But let's start at the beginning: It's pretty easy to set up - the directions on the dvd were great and I could do it all myself. I was really excited to use it so I hopped right on (I'm already used to ellipticals) and enjoyed a great workout.  I was sweating and after watching the training dvd, I worked my upper body and lower body.  I look forward to using it tomorrow.  Now I don't have to drag myself to the gym.  I can work out at home!  Downsides:  It does squeak, but some WD40 or petroleum jelly should fix that.  It folds up but it's not extremely portable.  I have it in my living room currently.  All in all I recommend this product.  I can feel the toning and with good diet and weight training, you'll see results
These straps work great. They are nice and thick and seem to be made well. They're easy to put on and they stay out of the way when you aren't using them. Valeo made a nice strap
This was bought for my boyfriend and I to sleep on when he comes to town. It is very comfortable and there is a lot of room for us!  It loses a tiny bit of air during the night but not so much that it is on the floor or anything.  It is a little difficult to get up off of it in the morning because it is like a water bed. If you get a good wave going you can jump right up!  The other problem I had with it is that it makes me sweat.  Even with the covering and a sheet. I am still sleeping on vinyl and so I sweat.  Not a lot but it is noticeable in the morning.  I am happy with the fact that it holds a lot of weight too because I am a big woman and my boyfriend is a big man. It holds us with no problem.  It was over all a very good purchase and I am happy with it
This is an easy rack to use.  It is quick to load bikes too.  Qualty seems very good.  I use it also on the floor of my garage to hold the bikes during storage.  I'm very happy with this product.Mik
When the product came I realized that it wasn't what I was looking for in a fanny pack but I was impressed with its rugged construction.  I needed a pack to walk around Disney World and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy.  I like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day.  The water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle. Plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another Dasani.  Unfortunately, you can't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that wouldn't stop a regular 16 oz. job from slipping passed.  So I'm returning mine, but if your looking for non breakable, wide mouthed water bottles, in a rugged waistpack then this is for you.   PS for some reason the blue one is cheaper, at least when I bought it
  The bar itself is exactly what I wanted.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the troubles I had on the purchase.  The bar arrived literally hanging out of the box, the box was really, really torn up.  The collars that spin on the ends were not even with the bar, needless to say the bar was useless untill I finally found some collars on ebay.  Amazon refunded all my $$ as soon as they were aware of the problem.  Overall the bar is great
I have been buying this brand of prescription goggles for at least 10 years. The price has been gradually coming down each year. I was surprised to find them so reasonably priced at Amazon of all places. These fit well, adjust easily and are extremely durable. I swim 6 days each week and I can easily get over a year of use from each pair. Typically the gaskets begin to deteriorate long before the lenses, when used daily outdoors in chlorinated pools. Keep them stored safely so the lenses don't scratch and rinse them in clear water after swimming and you'll be thoroughly satisfied with your purchase
This is a great pair of swimming goggles.  I swim a couple of times a week and I can't see a thing without my glasses.  This pair is very comfortable and does a great job correcting my vision.  I can't imagine swimming without them.  They have a wide field of vision, the adjustment is easy to use, and stays adjusted.  I've never had a problem with leaking.  For less then twenty dollars you can't go wrong. They are the best goggles I have ever owned.  Much better then the other brands.  Also, I recommend going slightly less then your current prescription, as the water will magnify things.
And so does Gadget Dad and Gadget Kids.Not only is it an affordable piece of equipment, but it's great for the whole family.Having twin boys age 13 and a husband and I who all added a few pounds of winter wool over the last few months, we really needed something that was going to fit nicely into our busy lives.  This does just that!I'll admit, I was a bit upset when I found that Gadget Dad had ordered it because I was the normal skeptic, but it's been well worth the investment and then some
I purchase my total gym and though it did not give me the workout that I expected, It did help me to get firmer and leaner in a short period of time. I wish it offered more of a workout for the legs but overall, I am very happy with my gym and I use it all the time. Only a 20 minute workout 3 times a week made a huge difference in the way I look
I got this accessory with my Door Gym and I like it.  But, when they say this is an "efficient" accessory - they mean it.  It simply rests on the narrower neutral grip posts of the Door Gym.  The Door Gym has multiple grip areas, but two of them are perpendicular to the rest of the bar for narrow neutral grip chin ups.  The Broad reach bar is wide with downward grips (like lat pull down bar in a gym).  Anyway, this works fine if you have the faith to try it the first time and prove to yourself it won't roll off because your body weight has it pinned on the posts. It has foam covering that adheres to the foam on the Door Gym posts. It will not roll easily, but it does a little. I think it is safe for adults who understand how to use it.  Do not give it to kids younger than about 15 (in my estimation) because some of them are too likely to play with, or misuse, it and get hurt.Even though this thing works and does what you want a broad bar to let you do, I deducted a point in the rating because I don't think  they were up front in explaining exactly what it is and is not
I'm pregnant and this bolster has saved my life.  It's great for meditation and to place btw. my knees while I sleep.
Mine is blackened, scratched, dented and I don't even carry the insides any more, but I love it.  This is usually the only cooking pot I carry backpacking because so much of our cooking anymore involves boiling water.  The wide mouth is perfect for scooping up water or snow.  I think it's part bucket.  This is the one
We used it today, for the first time and it works just fine. Heats quickly and is easy to pour
I purchased one and was so pleased that I bought another.  Keeps liquids hot for hours, much better than the Thermos I had.  Wash by hand - do NOT put it in the dishwasher or it will lose its thermal effectiveness (voice of experience)
This is a must have if you own the compatable shotgun. But a good tip if you get it would be to dump your bbs into another container and check through them for imperfections. (They will jam the magazine)Pros:- Very high cap! More than enough for a spring gun!Cons:- A bit long, and protrudes from the bottom of the gun quite a bit. (But still worth it
This clip is great and it doesn't just work on UTG guns it works on smith and wesson shot guns. Any one with a shot gun from UTG or smith and wesson should buy thisPs. I'm 1
I've had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years. All I wanted was a thin, small and light knife and I got it. The blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while, soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example. I have had the vary tip break a couple times but it's because I was doing something foolish with it (like using it as a throwing knife *wink wink* ;) ). It's not the best, it's not the worst but can compete with ether, witch is the best in my opinion. Shortly after I bought it the speed safe spring broke, eehhh who cares it opens fine without. It's vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface. It's vary thin profile is comfortable and I sometimes can't tell if I have it with me or not. It has what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead of cheap thin steel/plastic ones (means no binding up, even when in need of oil). The frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time.My favorite thing about it is the fact you can position the clip henge up or down. I chose henge down so it's ready to open the second it comes out of my pocket.If you want nice quality and availability for the price, kershaw is worth looking at
The knife is sleek and has a great profile. I love the speedsafe function on it. The blade lock is a bit stiff, but I suppose that's just so it doesn't slide open on accident
I purchased this pedometer to replace one that kept resetting itself back to zero ... the case cover on this one protects the buttons so it doesn't reset. I like the fact that I can open the lid and read the LED without taking it off. My only problem is the little leash ... it came with both a plastic and a metal clip.  The plastic clip has lost it's "springiness" and I'm sure will stop working soon; but at least I have the metal clip to fall back on
This pedometer is easy to set up and use.  I tested its accuracy at the local highschool track by walking a 1/2 mile, and sure enough, my pedometer read 1/2 mile. The clip is sturdy, I haven't had any problem with the device falling off.  The leash is a good extra - if it did fall off, it wouldn't hit the ground.  My doctor gave me a goal of 10,000 steps per day, so I wear this all day long.  It is light and I don't notice I am wearing it throughout the day.The only downfall to this device (as is probably true with others)is that your stride is measured for walking, so when you are running or doing other cardio activity (elliptical) it doesn't accurately measure your distance.  Since your stride is longer during a cardio activity (running), and the device is measuring your walking stride, the distance measurement falls short.  However, the actual number of steps taken is still accurately measured.  I suppose you could adjust the setting to a running stride when running to bridge this gap
I take a Ringside Boxing class at my gym and everyone bought these gloves and really likes them.  I ordered them from online because it was the only place I could find a size small.  I am very happy with them.  They offer excellent wrist support and protection for your fingers.  I really like the bar in the palm to help you grip when making a fist.  They do tend to leave your hands a little black after sweating in them, but it washes right off.  The only thing bad I have to say is that after only a couple of times of using them, the threading started to come apart at the pinky finger.  It can be sewed up, but you shouldn't have to do that so soon after the purchase.  No one else in my class seems to have had this problem.  I still gave them 4 stars, because I have a hunch that the threading isn't a common problem and I love them otherwise
I've been using these gloves for 3 years now and I had to buy a new pair as they were starting to be ripped off between the fingers.What I like: easy to setgood wrist supportgood grip with the middle barWhat I don't like:using wraps can be difficult if you don't take a size above and I recommend wraps otherwise the leather will burn your skin.For the price and the time that I've used them (2-3 times a week on heavy bags), they performed very well
I love my Broncos bagIt is very comfortable to wear and has lots of roo
If you have sinus problems or are sensitive to light you will love this.  Even without freezing or refrigerating it offers a nice cooling effect when you put it on. 
These cars can be summed up in two words FUN and LOUD.  I have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends.  They work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well.  I am even thinking of getting a third.  They do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily.  Well worth it.
We bought these so the children could have something to play with during the winter.  We backed our vehicles out of the garage, and zoom....they were off having fun.The box says "Ages 3+" and up to 55 pounds.  The bumper buggie looks small, but it is roomy enough for my 5 1/2 year old.  He weighs 45 pounds and is 45 inches tall.  He can stretch his legs out in the car, but chooses to keep his knees bent while driving.  My two year old can also work the controls.It is easy to use and the kids can do a complete 360.  My only complaint is that it is a little bit noisy, but no more than other battery-operated vehicles.I highly recommend this item.  It is so much fun!  Best part is that there is little assembly required.  The only thing we had to do was screw the seat into the car
very nice flooring for the price. easy to put together. I use it as weight room flooring in an exercise area I have set up in my garage. If you are looking for aerobic room flooring, I would recommend buying the 20mm version
It was suprisingly easy for me to put together considering I'm a 110lb girl. It only took about 3 hours but i did have trouble getting all the screws to get into their proper holes. It is slightly rickitty however I can go as fast as i want to and it won't brake or anything. It really is nice to be able to lose 200 calories while you watch your favorite T.V. shows.  Also, I am very tall and I had plenty of space, and it's nice to have the handle bars in the front and on either side. If you are looking for a reasonably priced bike that won't brake on you, Marcy is a good choice
This thing is great - my wife put it together in half an hour and she's an idiot. Nonetheless it is very solid.As a long time alcoholic I have a hard time getting up and a harder time going up and down stairs or walking in the grocery store, etc. Because this thing is low I can have the tv on, a drink on the floor on one side and my cigarettes on the floor on the other side and can reach them both while I pedal! I did 1 mile the first day at medium drag (despite what other reviewers have said there is a HUGE difference in drag between settings), 2 miles the second and am up to 5 miles per day now -  now I can drive my car to the store because my legs work again - this thing is really good. Plus it's silent - dropping two ice cubes in a glass makes more noise as does lighting a Bic lighter. But it is made in China... Note: shipping was free and it came in just a couple of days
If you're looking for a basic model without all the bells and whistles, this is an excellent choice. It's also very quiet and it's compact size was definitely on of the selling points for me. Only problem is that I wish the seat adjustment were easier to work. It gets a little stuck sometimes. Again, if you are looking for a basic model this is a good choice
I got this bike and I instantly liked it. The only problem was the seat could not fit properly to the base. I tried many times to tighten it up but doesn't help. Well, other than that its a wonderful bike, Zip noise and would burn a lot of calories.........
This chin up bar works well. I'm 160lbs and it holds me with ease. Great addition to any other home gym equipment, or if your on the road and need to work out in your hotel room or whatnot
The table appeared to be exactly expected regarding quality.  The shipment was also timely.  Unfortunately, we had to return the table as "the style was not quite right" for the situation of our game room
For the price this low-end home gym is generally able to do the things I wanted a cheap home gym to do.  However, there are a few issues you need to consider before buying it.  The biggest issue is ergonometric - this unit is not designed to be used by anyone over perhaps 5'10" or 5'11".  I'm 6'1" and this creates problems for me.  I have to find work-arounds to use a unit designed for people smaller than me.  The problem is that form is very important when doing the exercises (when you don't pay attention to form, you either reduce the effectiveness of the exercise or risk injury) and finding work-arounds sometimes compromises your form during the exercise.There are also a few quality issues but these were not entirely unexpected considering the price of the unit.  It would have been nice if the bench padding were a little better but its adequate.  The two most annoying quality issues involve the plate bars (the bars that hold the weights).  This first issue was with the plate bar on the lat tower (cable) unit.  It wasn't level.  This means the weights keep trying to fall off one side as you put them on.  The second issue is also with the plate bars.  The unit is designed to accommodate standard plates (small holes in the middle) or Olympic plates (big holes in the middle).  A "sleeve" is included with the unit that slips over the standard size plate bar that enables one to use Olympic plates (big holes).  However the outer diameter of the sleeve is slightly smaller than standard Olympic size so an Olympic size spring collar (to hold the weights on the bar) is too big and doesn't work.  I went down to Home Depot and bought wood clamps to hold the plates in place.  Kind of a pain but functional (just another work-around).  If you buy this unit you probably want to go with standard plates (small hole) rather than Olympic plates (big hole).So I put this at 4 stars because for this price you really can't expect too much and it generally delivers what I expected a cheap home gym unit to do - with the one caveat:  persons over 5'10" should try to find a home gym designed for taller people.  Since only 5% of the US population is over 6 feet tall manufacturers tend to design for smaller people.  If you're tall, good luck on that search
I bought the V2000 last year and it has worked great since then.  The compass has always given me accurate directions and has lasted through one winter and one summer so far.  I always left my V2000 in the vehicle, although the manual did state that you should take the device with you when the temperature is hot.  The V2000 has visible at all situations.  I can see it clearly in the dark with the V2000's automatic backlight, and see it clearly on a sunny day.  Finding a good place to put the temperature probe, however, is a hassle if you want to get accurate results.  Calibration was also a hassle for me.  You have to be on leveled ground and make a fairly even circle in order to get accurate readings.   
*****This is an upscale designer water bottle, top of the line, and so much fun. The designs Of Sigg's water bottles are gorgeous, from the plain, solid color bottles, to the ones with intricate designs. They are simply beautiful! I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns, thinking it would take more work to maintain. These do necessitate regular cleaning (I clean mine every day), but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun. Sort of like my rings, glasses, and watch, I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory, reminding me to drink more water, making a statement about my values, and expressing myself with a special design. Yes, all in a water bottle!Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality, made of light aluminum on the outside, slightly insulated, and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever, unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles. They are light, durable, and perfect for any activity. Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles, just like from the tap.Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops. I bought the screw top because I don't like sports tops, and I don't mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink. It is totally leakproof, which is important to me. The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner. I get comments on it all the time, "What's that? I love it!" The sports top version is ok; I just am not a fan, as I don't feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top. However, for convenience, you might prefer it. For children, there is a cap-type top. All are leak-proof. If you are ever unsatisfied with the top, you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle.Sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6L and 1L in this style. I have both. I use the .6L for sports activities because they are smaller. When I won't have to carry the container, I like the larger bottle. Sigg also makes a smaller .3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people. You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too, such as .75L, .4L (for kids), .6L, .5L. You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1.5L size, also. Search Amazon for the perfect size.Pick a style and pattern you like, as this bottle is a personal accessory, and should reflect your style. The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon.They are expensive, but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years. I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health, so they are well worth it value-wise for me.Highly recommended.****
This cooler is the perfect fit and size for our boat! The compact size was the main reason for buying this cooler. The lid is easy to open and close and it doubles as an extra seat.  It keeps everything nice and cold all day on the boat. 
I was very hesitant to purchase this bike because of all the problems other people reported with parts coming damaged/rusty. The only problem I had was the bar on the rear-bottom wouldn't fit all the way into the slot to put one of the screws in. I tried really hard to get it in, but it just wouldn't budge. Luckily, I could get the screw in on the other end, so it is relatively secure. The bike is a bit wobbly when your riding - now I don't know if this is because of my problem with the bar, or because that's just the way it is. but I don't feel like it's going to fall apart or tip over or anything.Over all, this is a really nice bike. The price is absolutely the best for what you're getting - especially if you choose the free super saver shipping. I got mine about a week from the day I ordered it. I don't think you will find another bike comparable to this for the price. Most recumbent bikes at this price don't offer any kind of resistance, what to speak of programs or the pulse monitor. It is really quiet - I can do it at 5 in the morning while my daughter is sleeping in the next room and not have to turn the TV up too loud. The seat is a bit uncomfortable, but it's not that big of a deal considering the price
Found the Edge 284 easy to asemble and use. It was less expensive than comparable models I checked out at 2 large fitness stores in my area and I didn't have to figure out how to get it home; it was delivered for FREE
The bike arrived in fine condition, no problems with bent or rusty parts like other people have reported.  It was really easy to assemble.  Once I had assembled it I tried it out and found that it made a really annoying noise as the wheel went around - as if the gears were scraping against something.  So, I undid all the screws (a pain) and opened the plastic-enclosed base.  There was a bracket that was meant to hold the pulse wires out of the way, but the adhesive on it had worn off or something and it was just kind of hanging, and would interfere with the gears.  So I taped it to the side, closed the plastic up, and that was that.  Since then the bike has worked really well.  I wish there was more ability to move it back - it is a good length for me but I can see how someone taller could have trouble with it.  The seat is not terribly comfortable, which gets to be a problem on longer rides, but it's fixable with a pillow or cushion.  The console is great - has all the information displayed all the time.  Plenty of resistance.Overall there are some problems with it, but for under two hundred dollars, I suppose I can't complain too much.  Definitely worth the money
This is an excellent product.  My 7 year old son had ADHD and he is constantly moving.  He has to take medicine to focus at school during the day and moves non-stop from waking up to going to bed at night.  His teacher was happy with his attention at school, but he was still fidgeting a lot.  She gave him this "Wiggle Seat" for his desk and has seen an amazing improvement in his ability to focus and and participate in class.  My son has noticed as well.  He has a hard time sitting at the table when doing his homework at night.  He told me I needed to get him a "Wiggle Seat" for home because it helps him concentrate.If you have a child with ADHD and you're looking for alternatives to medication, this is a great product to try.  And they'll get great posture as a bonus! :
Great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym. It's heavy and very dense, very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym's. Heavy duty, takes dropped dumbbell punishment, and resists damage/cuts. Use a drywall T-Square as a guide, and put a new blade in a box cutter. Take several passes to cut it and take your time. It cuts straight and square for a professional look. I will definitely buy these again when I get a bigger room for the gym
We tried out the cheap Barbie skates first just to make sure that our girl will enjoy skating.  After she puts on the K2, she was able to skate so much faster and smoother. 
This product was constructed better than the one I use at the gym. It is  very heavy duty and has lots of padding. It is comfortable for both myself and my husband to use.
Dear Amazon,     My new royal blue Armour duffle bag is the best travel bag I have ever owned.  It is durable beyond anything I have ever had and its design is beautiful with the honey combed stiching and perfectly balanced color design of blue and black.  I actually ordered a small royal blue carry-on duffle directly from Under Armour so the two match and I am utterly pleased.  Under Armour is definitely a KEEPER!!!!!

I was happy with my purchase I recieved my bearings within 6 business days. The bearings were in great condition
I already have a set of standard Bones Swiss, but since I was putting together a longboard with smaller wheels, I decided to get slightly faster bearings to make up for it.  These definately firt the bill, and the with the cheap $35.00 price and free shipping that Amazon offers, you can't go wrong.  These may seem dissappointing at first, but after about 3-5 hours of riding, they'll break in and go very fast.  Overall very reccomendable to anyone in the skateboard world
These are really great bearings.  Much faster than the conventional abec-7's I was using.     
Just a really great sports toy for kids. My son is 9 and he is already pretty good at it, but it is hard to keep my 15 year old from stealing it and riding it himself.  I would highly recommend the flowboard for lots of outdoor fun.
My 13 yr old wanted this and a waveboard for Christmas.  Since his dad and I are divorced, he ended up with both.  I got him the flowboard and he LOVES it.  Of course, I tried it too and was shocked to find it was actually easier for me to play with than his regular skateboard.  There is no chance I'm even going to try the waveboard, as I do value my intact bones.  I've been wanting to learn how to snowboard and this definitely gives the feeling of snowboarding, but without the snow!  It's well made, fun and definitely a hit
   Flowboards r way better than real sk8boards.They look cooler  probabally ride better than normal sk8boards.I seen it advertised on a commercial  decided right then thats what I wanted for Christmas
my husband looooved it from the moment he opened the box. excellent quality. looks very expensive.
I got this belt because it's the one my son's physical therapist uses in his pool therapy. It's great because it gives them some support but not too much. You can also remove floats as they get more comfortable in the water
THe swim belt I ordered was awesome.  Perfect for my 3 year old to learn how to swim.  The great thing about it is that you can adjust their bouyancy.   Take one or two of the floaty squares off and they have to try to swim a little harder.  It also helps them keep the correct body position for learning how to swim
These are fantastic belts for teaching children how to swim.  They offer mobility and support and have the ability to lessen the support as time goes on.  I taught swimming for years and this is the product I'd recommend
Purchased this tricycle for my grandson - 3rd birthday - a huge success!!!!  Not only was it reasonably priced, it came w/free shipping - great deal
I am very pleased with Knife's . The vender was great. I ordered them and in 3 days I had them . Thank You all. TS
The scales/handles seem decidedly gray, rather than black.  Pen has nice length.  Battery hidden under plastic liner.  Even found a nice thin layer of oil of some tools!  :~))     At the outer limit re carrying in front pants pocket .... unless work jeans
This compass is better than I thought it would be especially for the price.  It's a great deal.  I purchased it for a car and it work well for it
I would just like to tell everyone who didn't understand the use of this item...They aren't actually anti-gravity boots!  They are used for a type of exercise called inversion where you put the boots on and attatch them to a bar hanging either from a wall or cieling, so in other words, you hang upside down with these boots while attatched to a bar.  They are in no way meant to make you float, or fly, or anything else that can only be found in sci-fi magazines..
This is a great snorkel.  Seals well against your face and the water really does stay out if a wave comes by.  The purge valve on bottom works well
I bought this gun and 2 days after the dang stock broke. other than that it was ok, good acuricy. the clip holds 545 in the amunition holder. and 15-17 shots in the magazine. also the lazers sight does not work
This is a wonderful gym.  It is similar to the boflex but without the HIGH pricetag.  Delivery was very fast.  I am very satisfied!
These are good to keep on hand for hiking for that quick energy and I also try to keep some of these or a smiliar product in my purse if my blood sugar drops.  I am not a diabetic, but I have gotten low blood sugar my whole life and when I get it I use this or something else to get it back up fast so I can be comfortable.  This really works and tastes great too.  They really did well with this product.  I like to go geocaching and I get out for a long while on hikes this is great to have in the backpack when I need quick fuel
The Indo board is an essential product for off-season and even on-season snowboarders, skateboarders, wakeboarders, etc. It allows you to practice your moves, and learn some new moves!
I own several Pelican cases.  When I saw the options for cases for my MacBook, I knew that this case would be just what I needed.The MacBook 13.3" fits snugly inside the case.  The case says 13" notebooks, but the extra width of the MacBook is accepted.  The case is shipped with small foam large and small spacers.  I used the large spacers but placed them inside the top lid of the case so that the notebook screen wouldn't be opened when I opened the Pelican.I don't have any worries now when I toss my notebook into a backpack and travel.  I felt uneasy about having to take my notebook out of my Pelican 1510 carry-on case when gate-checking my carry-on luggage for small regional jets
I bought this for my son (recommended by his special ed teacher) and the whole family has been using it ever since.  It's a nice, sturdy, trampoline and it's not too expensive.  The "folding" part is a little disappointing which I why it's not getting full stars.  However, we haven't needed to use that feature so it wasn't that important to us.  Overall this is a good quality trampoline for those who are looking for something less expensive
Outstanding design. Secure, heavy duty, super easy to load, very protective of the bikes. Best possible design for older or limited users
I purchased this for Christmas for my 8 year old son to play with.  It was $329 with free shipping compared to $450 at the local sports store.  The finished product looks great, appears to be rugged and stable and is quite easy to adjust.  I only gave it 4 stars because assembly was not easy, and I am mechanically inclined. Practically all the holes needed to be drilled or reamed out in order to accept the bolts and the directions were ambiguous.  It was a 4 hour assembly, with filling the base with screened sand really taxing my patience.  But the smile on the 8 year old's face was well worth the aggravation.    On a side note, I ordered 70% of my Christmas shopping from Amazon, with everything except this arriving before the estimated delivery date (everything else shipped UPS).  They shipped this via DHL, which never delivered the package.  I had to drive 120 mile round trip to pick it up at the DHL facility and take time off of work the Friday before Christmas to retrieve my son's primary gift.  I emailed Amazon requesting $70 credit to reimburse me for my time and gas, which they did in a few days.  This was an oversized package that I assume UPS would not accept.  Nonetheless, their choice of shippers reflects on Amazon as a company.   
This product does what it claims it will do.  Put in the time and effort - you'll feel great! Of course, I don't ever expect to look like the model on the box.  However, I feel good and I think I look a little better than when I started.  Only doing it a few weeks, but enjoying it
I've worked out with Cathe for about 6 months now, and I have to say, this is one of my favorite workouts.  It combines cardio with upper and lower body in a 60 minute circuit workout.  The cardio bursts are short but intense- expect to jump, do Power 15's, fast feet shuffles, spike lunges, etc.  Lower body work - well, let's just say, I hope you like to do leg press- since you'll be doing it  - A LOT.  There are a total of 6 sets of leg press - on each leg.  Also, Cathe inserts some static lunges and squats, among other moves.  She does hover squats with pulses of 16 over the high step- your quads will be feeling the burn, there!  Arm work includes typical weighted and non-weight work, such as tricep dips off the high step, push ups, bicep curls, overhead extension, etc.Overall, if you're looking for a challenge and a new circuit workout to shock your muscles, this is the workout for you.  Beginners, beware- you can modify certain exercises (I use dumbbells instead of a barbell) - but this is more for the intermediate or advanced exerciser
Skim boards keep the kids busy for hours, this a great way to get the kids away from the TV. This board is nice especially with Free shipping..
The bar is very solid and has a good looking chrome finish. It takes olympic weight plates (2 inch diameter.) The shipping and packaging are good too. Overall , i have no complaint with this purchase. I would recommend this bar
I recently recieved this watch as a Christmas gift.  I am amazed at the amount of information this watch can gather.  I can check my altitude, see if a storm is brewing, and time each lap of my mile jog.  Everthing works great and is very accurate.  After a glance through the instruction manuel I was able to use and set all the functions with ease.  I love the feel of the band; it is a perfect fit for my wrist.  I would reccomend the stainless steel for best look and price.  This watch is truly fun to use and show off.  It is the perfect watch
You'll never mistake the Shake flashlight for a powerful spotlight, but that's not it's purpose.  It's a niche item, the perfect flashlight to stick in your car trunk or emergency bag and then forget about it.  With no batteries or bulbs, you know it'll always be ready for use whenever you need it.When it first arrives, you'll need to shake it hard for a couple minutes to charge it up, but just think of it as aerobic exercise.  Once it's charged, it provides sufficient light to read instructions or maps, determine colors of wires or diagrams, and keep you from stumbling around in the dark.  I was surprised by just how bright the Shake flashlight was after about 3 minutes of hard shaking.  The only improvement I can think of would be to have a small diode glow when the flashlight is turned off.  When the light begins to dim, a few shakes will keep the light strong enough to use.Unlike the previous reviewer, I had absolutely no problems with delivery - I ordered it on 12/26 (non-expedited mail) and it arrived on 12/30, exactly as described
I go to Anime expos alot. And to to be honest this sword aint half bad. Unlike its 67' brother its only 37' but its a whole lot better to wield. Combat Ready, Very Sturdy and made in CHINA. I notice some swords made in PAKISTAN! and they usually end up breaking so this swords worth the buy if your a bleach fan and if you wanna save some cash
I am very impressed with the F4. It is very easy to use and a good basic heart rate monitor. It is easier to program than my F6, and it fits better.Polar makes the best HR monitors, and it works with all their chest straps - coded and uncoded, and even with ones that are not from them. I have Vision Fitness exercise equipment, and the strap works with their HR function. Sometimes I strap the watch to the equipment so I can read while I exercise, and I'm able to continually see the HR without constantly changing the view on the equipment.The color is more of a gray color than an ice blue, so it goes with just about anything you wear. I'm really looking forward to using this unit while I go out and do my walks this spring! I can't imagine buying anything else but Polar. This is my third watch and all three of them are still working well
I love this watch!  It's easy to use.  It's also a very basic watch.  It gives your heart rate, zone and calories burned.  It's very nice for what it is supposed to do.  If you're looking for a watch with a lot of bells and whistles, this is not the one for you.  It looks nice and it's not too bulky.  The only reason I would have gotten the F6 is because it says it has something that prevents "cross talk" (interference with others wearing a heart monitor watch.  There are three of us where this same exact watch in my cycling class and we've never had a problem with "cross talk."  As the other reviews said, there is no backlight.  Would recommend
I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season.  Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such.  This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera!
I bought this from lifeline recently and it has been an EXCELLENT addition to my home gym equipment.  I'm not a person who travels back and forth to a gym each day.  I also do not like paying an arm and a leg for expensive pieces of workout equipment that eventually become expensive coat racks.  This workout solution is about as low tech as it can get.  I agree with the previous reviews below--you could almost make this one yourself.  It consists of a strip of mesh webbing--like seatbelt material; two adjustable, quick locking clips; handles made of webbing and plastic tubes; and another piece of plastic tubing that locks the Jungle Gym into place when the door is shut.  The equipment is simple, but sets up in seconds.  The clips adjust quickly and are incredibly secure.It's so simple--but it really works.  The emphasis of the instruction sheet and the DVD that came along with it, is in upper body strength.  You can do chin ups--by regulating height, you can work up from lifting part of your body weight to full body weight.  For me, this was the best part of the Jungle Gym.  My chin ups/pull ups have improved remarkably by using the device.Body rows, push ups, and fly push ups are also possible.  Using the Jungle gym, pushups take on a new dimension with a fuller range of motion (like an Atlas pushup)and given the instability of the webbing, you also get more of a core workout.  You can use the webbing for balance as well as to maintain better technique when doing squats.  You can also make the exercises more challenging by using a fitness ball.  You can do abdominal crunches by holding the handles and lifting your feet from the floor.Some exercises (full body rows and dips) are difficult when attached to a door and Lifeline suggests draping the Jungle Gym over a tree limb so you can achieve a truly vertical workout.  I have not yet tried using this over a tree limb...  However, I was able to perform the dips with some creativity while attached to a door but it was not easy.This is not a full fitness solution.  But when used in conjunction with weights and exercise bands, it really makes the home gym complete.  I have searched for a pull up bar for a long time that is removable, but none of the current offerings fit the odd sized door frames and moldings of my 99 year old house.  The Jungle Gym has worked.  Given the ability to do pull ups of varying difficulty, it has also improved my ability to do pull ups/Chin ups over a short period of time.The downside of the device is that it requires a STURDY DOOR and DOOR FRAME.  I would be leery of using the device is the door does not close securely AND LOCK or if you are worried about the integrity of your house's construction.  Remember, the Jungle Gym is strong enough to hold your body weight, but the door it is connected to has to be able to do the same.  If not, you will find yourself flat on your back with a new home improvement project to do.  Remember too, that when your feet are touching the ground and you do pull towards the door, the weight decreases as you pull. This is not a defect of the device, it's just the physics of the situation.  (With free weights, the weight is stable throughout your range of motion.  With exercise bands the weight increases as the band lengthens.)  Also, this is a great device for weight/circuit training, but is not really an aerobic solution.The Jungle Gym, along with a few exercise bands are IDEAL for travel.  I used mine with three lifeline exercise bands (2 R6s and 1 R8), exercise band door attachment and the lifeline triple grip handles.  This yielded a gym that weighed less than two pounds, fit in my suitcase easily and allowed for a variety of body weight and resistance exercises
except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen/shorten the strap again. Does exactly what it is supposed to do, and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability. Great for spotting oneself too. I would buy it again, tho I don't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe. So if you can burn the $35 or so, get it with no fear. Otherwise, use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout
I bought this item after much research and this particular model was suggested to me by a friend.  No problems at all with shipping; package was in perfect shape though only delivered to my back steps.  I opened up the box and brought in pieces individually, with the flywheel being the heaviest (though I was able to bring in myself).  It took me about 2 hours to put together.  Instruction book was better than most I have seen, and only problem was the misprint in bolt sizes, but you can figure that out easily (as everyone has noted on their reviews).  The elliptical's size is on the smaller size and fits well in my sitting room.  Easily moved if need be.In regards to the workout.  I cross train on my treadmill and found this workout to be as effective.  There are a variety of programs so you can vary your workout.  The backward motion is a little awkward for me (I am 5'3") but found that holding onto the lower handlebars works well (versus the movable upper ones).  The machine is very quiet, only slight squeeking coming from the upper handlebars that disappeared with a little WD40.  It has very smooth movement and you can definitely tell a difference with increasing the level, which I was worried about as it doesn't have an incline as some gym machines do.  The heel rise can occur when you do not sit back on your heels when working out, so you just need to be aware of your foot placement.  The foot pads are comfortable and a good size.  Most of all, for those who do monitor their heart rate, I have a Polar F11 heart monitor (with chest strap) and this monitor is within a 3 beat difference at the most.  I recommend to let the monitor read for a minumum of 45 seconds before you follow the rate.  This held true for me even if pacing at 70 RPM's or above.  I listen to my IPOD when I work out, so I have not used the book holder.  The water holder holds 24 oz Polar Spring bottles without any difficulty taking out and replacing the bottle.I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking at increasing their fitness level in the comfort of their own home.  It's very well built/solid, quiet, effective, and affordable ($599, free pad, free shipping)
My husband and I finished off a bottle of wine before assembling the unit. : ) It only took us an hour and a half to assemble, and our kids were running around like a couple of nuts during the process. After we finished the assembly, we both took a turn on a preset program. The machine is extremely sturdy, quiet, and worked like a charm - just like a unit found at a gym. We're extremely pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone
A standard 5' bar. Not sure how accurate the weight is. It feels more than 13 pounds, but that could just be me. Not a big deal either way
I've had Ab Sonic for three years.  I bought it at Target.  It's great.  It allows me to have a productive workout, while I'm working overtime to be productive
Just purchased this chair 3 wks ago and so far so good!  I use it almost every morning for 15 minutes while I watch the news.Needed a chair like this because I'm starting to get a gut and my pants are getting too tight.  I hate exercizing and definitely don't have the will/motivation to go to the gym consistently.  I bought the ultra version because I needed to be able to hide it away when it isn't being used.  Once folded up (4 1/2 inches tall - 29 inches wide - 39 inches long) it fits very nicely under my couch.It is fairly easy to fold up/unfold but it could be easier which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  There are 2 bungee type straps that need to be unhooked, 2 curved handle bars need to be removed (simple twist knobs), and one stabilizer bar undone (simple twist knob) to fold this unit down.  Removing the parts and folding the unit takes less than 2 minutes.  Not difficult just wish it was easier.Overall, I would definitely make this purchase again knowing what I now know. 
This thing is great. Built tough as nails. There are myriad exercises for you to do from beginner to advanced as your core strength and stability improve. You won't be disappointed in the results if you stick with it. Get it. USE it.
I worked with Eureka to design this exclusive tent for Amazon.  (Note: I work at Amazon and am biased),...but want to share why we built this tent for Amazon customers.Eureka is one of the best names in the Outdoors industry.  Their Timberline tent design has been one of the most popular tents for decades.  They have built on that innovation, and I believe build the best "family camping tents" in the business.  This tent was designed to offer customers an incredible value for a large family tent that has all the special features for a good-sized family:- Spacious  and big.  It has a center height of 7 feet, and feels huge.  It's a 11x11 and gives you 121 square feet.  You can fit 2 queen sized airbeds quite comfortably- Easy assembly.  Shock-corded fiberglass poles and ring-and-pin systems make for an easy set-up with 2 folks.  - Quality.  From seams that are sealed to high quality mesh.  This tent is designed for rugged use through 3 seasons.As I re-read this review, I realize I haven't done a sufficient job in highlighting the spacious feel of this tent.  7 foot center height is tremendous! 
It works as advertised. Not a lot to say about a bike rack. I have hardly any wobble from mine, and I suspect those that do didn't assemble theirs correctly or aren't tightening the hitch pin bolt down far enough. My only complaint is the weight--it uses a really heavy steel tube for the vertical portion of the rack, which I don't quite understand. The vertical tube has the lowest load, with the highest load being on the hitch draw tube. But it's not that big a deal. It just increases the weight on the rear of the car needlessly
We also bought this bike rack because of the price and it will hold 4 bikes.  It could be improved on the Hitch end but it was not bad.  It does tend to loosen at highway speeds but we use it with the larger attachment for class 3 hitches.  It kept our bikes from damaging our Suburban.   We use it for adult bikes and also several smaller BMX bikes.  It is more challenging to get the BMXs on.  One trick is to make sure you swing the arm down to mount the one inside bike, then tilt it back up for the other three.   Also use a wrench and tighten the hitch bolt very tight with the lock washer or it will loosen on the highway. We also bought a big Schwin cable lock to run through the bike frames for security while parked
Neoprene pouch keeps water cool, but it has a very strong displeasing smell, kind of like used motoroil, which overpowers the taste of what your drinking from the bottle. So you might want to pour your drink into a cup to enjoy it. 
We got this for our son.  He loves it!!!  Can't hardly reach the pedals but that dont stop him.  Stylish and well built, I think it should last a long time.  Great product, would recomend to anyone!!
This item garners the same complaint that I have with the Aqua Sphere pull buoy: it floats, is functional, but nicks/gouges very easily.  I try to keep this away from the sharper objects in my swim gear bag (snorkel, fins), but it still gets dented, nicked, scratched, and gouged.  Regardless, it works quite well and I really like the smooth underside, the ribbed handholds, and the ample crescent at the base (perfect for kicking with my head down into the water).  One of the best parts is that it isn't as small as a kid's kickboard, but it's not huge, either.  Really good product overall
I just recently baught this weight tree since i had a weight bench and I needed a place to put the 400 lbs. besides the floor.  The the weight tree does hold that much weight and could hold more, the only thing I do not like is that it does bend in a little, when you put the max weight on a slot.  But it does its job
Treadmill sets up fairly quickly, unless you are a moron, then it might take you some time.  The pistons are stiffer than I thought they would be, allowing for a very challenging upper body workout.  I usually row while I am watching TV or a game, and have never had to turn up the volume because of the noise - it really is very quiet.  Unless you are looking for a health club quality rower, this rower would be a very good pick for nearly anyone
I had one of these similar many years ago and let it go at a garage sale. Dumb idea! As I get older, this Stamina machine has replaced it and is giving me all the exercise I need. Good to set in front of the tv and row for 30 minutes, I've gone from a size 40 to a size 36 waist. I like the hydraulic part of it and the adjustability
I used to have a similar product, this one works the same except for one little handy detail: it doesn't stand on itself like the old one I had
I bought this for my medium sized 9mm. Luger with the laser sight attached to it. My cousine, who has been in the Military for several years, recommended it to me. I'm only 3 feet 6 inches tall, and it fits me well. He is over six feet tall, and it fits him just as well. It takes a little time to adjust it to your liking but, well worth the money. It is comprable to holster costing 5 times as much
When I got the machine and started putting it together, I noticed I was missing a few small pieces.  Understandable, I think, as this machine was shipped from Germany.  3$ and a trip to my local hardware store later, the Kettler Kadett was all assembled.  I had some problems with the foot straps loosening while I exercised, but I found that a velcro strap fastened around the toe area (to provide an additional foot strap) and some velcro adhesive slapped on the existing foot strap fixed that problem.  With the exception of those minor nuisances, the Kettler Kadett is an amazing piece of machinery.  When I use it, I can tell it's not going to break or fall apart at the nuts and bolts.  It went together easily and it's solid as a rock when I use it.  I've never rowed on a real boat in my life, but this feels just as I'd imagine it would.  And of course the most important part, when I get off, I feel like I've gotten a gym quality work out.4 out of 5 stars for this rowing machine, the packaging could have been better and slightly re-designed foot wraps, but all in all an excellent buy
I had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses.  The hugger-mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it doesn't cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip.
My kids and I have several backpacking stoves - and we are currently ONLY using the Brunton CRUX... all the others have been mothballed.  The Brunton is well made and very reliable.  It's lightweight and very efficient.  We are able to cook for 3 people for one week using one large fuel canister
Many years ago, an acquaintance of mine was the property manager of a low-rent motel.  One morning, while he was in the back office behind the front desk, two men jumped over the counter and started beating on the door.  He could see them, but they could not see him through the privacy security glass.  The men continued to beat on the door, trying to get in.  He waited inside patiently, with his Glock pistol.  As soon as the door fell and the men ran inside, he shot them both.  They turned out to be high school teenagers who were trying to break in to obtain crack money.  I recalled that many in the community dissaproved of his actions.  It turned out that he had plenty of time to leave through the back door and call for help.  When asked why he had to kill them, he simply said, "I own the life of anyone who threatens my personal safety.  I did it because it was my right and I could."  Fortunately, it was considered self-defense.I remembered that he always carried a short stick, attached to his keys.  It was not until many years later that I finally figured out what that little wooden stick was.  I became interested in self-defense and decided to buy a baton for myself.This was my first Kubaton.  I was concerned because this one has a pointed end.  The pointed end, although not sharp compared to a blade weapon, will easily punch a hole through four layers of very heavy cordura cloth with little effort on my part.  I was afraid that if ever I had to use it, the amount of damage it will cause and its design would make it hard for me to claim that I was acting in self-defense.  I bought another Kubaton, from the same manufacturer, with a flat end.  The replacement baton is exactly like this one, except the end is flat.  I tested the replacement and it will also punch a hole through heavy canvas.  But it takes a lot more force to do so.  More importantly, to the average person, it looks less aggressive than this one.  If I had to use it in self-defense, a presiding judge or jury might be less likely to think of it as a weapon.If you are not concerned about perception, then get this pointed baton.  If it can easily punch a hole through layers of cordura cloth (the same material used in heavy duty outdoor bags, outerwear, and hiking shoes), it can easily injure an attacker who might be wearing several layers of clothes.  But please understand that some might put this in the same category as they would a knife.  That might make it difficult to claim self-defense, in the event that you have to use it to protect yourself.  My old acquaintance was well-versed and knowledgeable.  He not only knew how to use his weapons, but he also understood where the line is between self-defense and assault.  He knew just the limits of what he could get away it in the use of deadly force to defend himself.  This pointed baton, made out of hardened aluminum alloy, is probably for such a person.MY FRIEND'S TIP:Here's a tip from that old acquaintance of mine.  The keys themselves are a part of the weapon.  And you can make them more effective, which will increase the damage from the baton.  Take some keys that you no longer use.  Any metal key would do, but try to find different sizes.  About four of them would do.  Take the keys to a grinder (even a rasp will do) and sharpen the teeth of each key.  Now, put the four keys in the keyring along with your regular keys.  Face the sharp keys in opposite directions.  Meaning two should face one way, but the other two should face in the opposite direction.  The idea is that when you swing the baton like a flail, the sharpened keys would cut into the attacker's flesh.  The keys are faced in opposite directions so that you can do major damage regardless of which direction that you are swinging.  CITAN'S EXPERIMENT: Please keep in mind that you can also cut your hand.  I tried this technique.  I wore a pair of leather work gloves and swung against a wooden post.  The sharpened keys bounced back and hit the back of my hand.  Without the gloves, my hand would have gotten badly cut.  For what it's worth, I swung against a large watermelon and the keys didn't bounce back though.  I don't have anything else to add here, except maybe it might be good to swing against an attacker's fleshy parts to prevent the keys from rebounding.  I'm not an expert though.  But it was fun trying it on a watermelon
THIS PUPPY GOT TO ME SO FAST IT MADE ALL MY OTHER ORDERS SEEM LIKE THEY GOT CAUGHT UP IN CHRISTMAS RUSH!! S $$ WAS WELL WORTH THE SPEED OF DELIVERY!!
Let me start by saying that I ordered this rowing machine on April 2 and it arrived on April 5!  I was so excited!Even though it has poor instructions on putting this machine together, it isn't impossible.  The tension strap is twisted around part of the machine that needs to be unwrapped first and that is not mentioned in the instructions.  Also, two of the steps seem to be out of order, but I still give this product a 5 star rating.  When I was in college, I used a machine like this in their exercise room and loved it.  This is just like it, but I think it's even better.  I don't have a problem with the foot holders on this machine like I did with the one at college.The quality is great for the value.  I feel that I have enough resistance and that I'm getting the workout that I'm looking for.  I use an elliptical rider first, then I get on my rower.  This is now rounding out my workout and I love it!  My elliptical rider is a gym quality machine and was very expensive but worth the cost.  This rower is inexpensive, but doesn't feel like a cheap machine.  Again, I am thrilled with it. By the way, I don't think that you can tell it in the picture, but the fan cover has holes all the way around it.  When I'm working out I can feel the breeze that it is generating.  It doesn't blow me away, but it's enough to cool me off some.I hope you find the machine you're looking for.  If you're looking to save some money and get a great workout, this may be the rower for you. 
Let me start out by saying that this rower is not perfect. It is, in fact,  flawed. As you may have noticed, I still gave it a five star rating and I will try to explain the reasons for doing so.Reading the reviews here, I noticed two complaints: One pointing out that this machine doesn't perform to the same standards that professional gym rowers do and the other regarding assembly of this machine.I researched the various rowers available in the market for quite a while. I spent a lot of time and effort driving around and trying various models before purchasing this one simply because I tend to be an informed shopper who wants to get value for his money. During my research, it became very evident that my favorite rower is a Water Rower followed by Schwinn's WindRigger - both were extremely smooth in their operation. Both were also about $1000! At any rate, these sophisticated rowers gave me a benchmark against which to compare the Integrity and it should surprise nobody that the Integrity doesn't really come close to the performance of either of the other two rowers. And it shouldn't, given it substantially lower price.And this is exactly what it important in considering this rower: You cannot expect to get a professional-grade rower for such a low price just like you cannot expect to get the comfort and performance of a Rolls Royce if you are buying a Honda. Nonetheless, what you DO get from Integrity is well within the parameters of what I would expect for about $200.The machine is reasonably stable, it is reasonably smooth, and it does provide a great workout. The noise level is also not too bad and actually seems less than that of the WindRigger. The electric monitor is basic and provides speed, time, calories burned, and distance. It also provides an option that continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all of them during your workout. The seat is comfortable and slides smoothly along the track and the whole thing actually has a pretty professional look to it and doesn't appear flimsy. I was also quite surprised by the level of resistance this rower provides - it is much more than that of the Schwinn WindRigger. In addition, resistance can be adjusted pretty easily.I think my only disappointment is that the air-flow created during operation is not channeled toward the person using the machine to aid in cooling him/her down - but this is certainly a flaw I can live with. As a potential buyer you should also be aware that the rower tends to slide across smooth surfaces such as tile - which means you need to have a non-slip mat under it if you intend to use it on such a surface.As I said before, I also read that at least one person had a problem assembling this rower. I cannot confirm this problem. Assembly was extremely easy and quick - even though the instructions are not the greatest. However, it should be quite clear to most people where parts go and what needs to be hooked up where. Winding up the chain onto the gear wheel is a breeze, too. All you need to do is unhook it from the retracting cord that you hooked it up to one or two steps before. I suppose the person who wrote the instructions could have switched these steps to make it more logical - but as I said, the instructions are not great. Taking all these factors into account, I think Integrity provides a fantastic product for a very low price. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does so in a surprisingly good manner. However, as with any product, your expectations should be realistic and if they are, you will not be disappointed. If you expect a gym-quality machine - you will not get what you are looking for. If, however, you are looking for a basic functional rower without all the bells and whistles of high-end products, then this is probably the best deal you can get
Yesterday I overtook a threesome at the second hole with this baby, if ya know what I mean ... those gals dropped their walkers and flocked around me.Thing's got hella acceleration too. Damn
I wonder why the other reviewer had leaking problems - perhaps a bad silicon seal?  I compared this in store to other products by thermos, no-names, etc, and it is one of the most solidly built food carry products I've ever seen or used.  I should have bought it years ago, and it would have saved hundreds of dollars via home-made lunches.  And jeez, the worry that every time you put tupperware/ziplock lunches in your bag, something is going to leak - how much is that worth to put to rest forever?  I used to wrap my food-carrying plastic wear in TWO plastic bags in case of inevitable leakage.  Never again.  This thing is solid.  I must admit, it appeals to my guy side, (see my bachelor-style typical lunch and dinner, below) with the hammered green siding and shiny metal parts.  I think I sprouted a few extra hairs on my chest after I bought it.  It looks like something you might dig out of the basement in your parents' house, to which they would say, "Oh, that used to be your grandfather's, and I used it too.  It still works."  They could call it the Man-Jar.  (Ladies, don't be afraid, the thermal properties are gender-blind, and green will be in this fall)If you got dumped recently by your girlfriend (or wife, or mom, or whatever), this jar can help you in your process of manly rediscovery.  Despite the fact that spending money is something I generally discourage, this jar will actually help you save money in the long run. You could carry it home late at night on the subway as a weapon.  Heck, my cooking is a pretty dangerous payload.Technical stuff:I put a heated hamburger patty and microwaved (prev. frozen) vegetables into the container, with a thermometer.  Started at 180 deg. F, and arrived at 140 deg. F four hours later.  I bought it before a 7-day road trip, living out of a cooler in the back of my car.  I didn't eat a SINGLE crappy fast-food meal, and I didn't spend a dollar on anything but gas.*  All healthy, pre-cooked, home-style, k-dog-style stuff.  Get yourself a Corning wear microwave bowl with a heavy-duty fridge plastic cover, and you have a home-cooked meal at every rest stop.I've put boiling water in it, let it sit overnight, with the top off, and it was still warm in the morning.  * And a hotel.  And a speeding ticket.  I musta been so excited to have this food bottle.  Damn ohio pigs
This is one of the only things I have every bought sight unseen on Amazon.  This canopy is very well made and a breeze to set up and put away.  The carrying case on wheels is an extra bonus
It does the job; I haven't had it long enough to attest to its durability.  Too bad the shipping cost more than the product
I have been using a headlight for years when I work night shift at the hospital.  When that light gave out, I bought this one.  I like having the three settings of brightness.  Though I had a light on my bike handlebars, I wanted to get a light that would go on my helmet.  It came down to two choices and I went with the Aurora since I had been impressed with it at work. It turns out that it is brighter than the light I had on my handlebars that I paid more for just last summer.  Now I wish I had gotten an Aurora for my handlebars, also
     I was surprised at how good this worked with very little uncomfortableness while sleeping.  It didnt take much pressure on the toesto be able to get up in the morning with very little pain on my heal.  Had problems for the last 4 months before the Thermoskin.  Have been using it 2 weeks now and am already trying to slowly get back to running.Great product
The Cold Steel Spike Tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price.It is viciously sharp and will remove arm hair quite easily.  It has a width across the spine of the blade that is unmatched by any knife its size I have ever seen.  Virtually indestructible.  The case is excellent if plain.  This knife leaves very wide wounds in steak; I think stitches would be the only way to close the wounds.On the down side it doesn't hold an edge very long and its handle is very short and I wear a medium glove.Overall this is a knife built for the sole purpose of self defense.  It is small to make it easily concealable and comes with its own neck chain.  It is a knife that won't let you down when the going gets tough, used in its intended purpose it should be virtually indestructible and wickedly efficient.   
This is the perfect monitor for the average person.  The chest strap communicates with the machines at my gym so I don't have to look at the watch while using the machines.  While walking or jogging the watch provides a quick way to know your heart rate.  I haven't used the other features that are offered so I can't rate them, but it does everything that I wanted out of it when I purchased it
My treadmill came with a heart monitor of the same chest-strap type that only worked about half the time.  I never had a problem like that with this one, once it's on, it keeps reading until I take it off.  It's also compatible with all the treadmills/ellipticals/bikes at the gym, so I don't have to hold the handles any more
I am very happy with this watch. I really enjoy running and I wanted to learn how to get the best benefit from running without over-exertion and injury. The polar website said heart-rate monitoring helps with pace, getting the desired benefits from my run, and helped to reduce injury.Pros: Works perfectly, immediately picked up by the gym equipment--no holding on required, setting 3 zones for warm-up, running, and cool down was a snap, the audible beeps help me to know when I'm slacking off or working too hard, the constant feedback is very motivating.Cons: Not many here, however, the screen seems difficult to see in the sunshine. Will have to see the effect of that when spring comes !I did a lot of shopping online and I liked the Polar M-61 ($130) best but I got this one because of the lower price ($80). The M-61 has more features and is more fashionable; so you may want to look at that one too
I'm no professional bike mechanic, but this stand has been great for my little at home workshop. If you're looking for a more precise truing stand spend a little more money. It does the job if you're like me and just want you wheels true enough, not necessarily perfectly true
I've always loved Victorinox Swiss Army Knives, but I must admit that I when I purchased this one, I was not sure if I made the right choice, but my expectations were soon exceeded.  It was right before a trip to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota, I had lost my other Swiss Army Knife (a Tinker), and I was looking for a versatile knife with a locking blade.  I did not need dozens of other tools for my pending stay in the wilderness.  I settled on this one because it was on sale, and I have not been disappointed.The handle has a mild contour that made it very comfortable to handle.  For its size, it had just the right heft, but it was not too heavy to weigh down my shirt (where I kept it in my buttoned breast pocket).The 4" locking blade worked wonderfully.  I could close it with either one or two hands.  When closing it, the blade pauses at the halfway point, reducing the risk of closing it on your fingers when closing it one-handed (that said, it does not eliminate all risk, so close the knife with one hand at your own risk).  During my recent canoe trip, I lost my fillet knife on a portage trail and was surprised that cleaning a 24" northern pike with this blade was quite painless (though it did take some skill).Beyond the blade, I've always found the leather awl and the screwdriver handy, but the can opener blade is a primary reason why I prefer Victorinox Swiss Army knives over those produced by Wegner.The knife shipped in a simple cardboard box.  A sheath or pouch would have been nice, but I was able to fabricate one with duct tape before my trip.  Since I kept it in my shirt pocket for most of my trip, the sheath wasn't necessary, but it is one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife.I recommend getting one.  You will not be disappointed
Here's a secret for the uninformed: This is a very popular scale with people who never weigh a single fish. This is perhaps the best inexpensive package scale you can get, and if you're a regular eBay seller, it's one of the best tools you cna buy for making accurate weighings for estimating shipping charges. With this scale and a plastic bag, you can weigh any package, no matter how irregularly shaped, and get a weight accurate within an ounce or two. But remember- it's a secret
These flashlights are made in China.  That is not too surprising nowadays and is in no way an adverse comment on their quality and construction which seem to live up to what we might hope from a traditional American brand such as Smith  Wesson.  I have two of these and I expect them to last me the rest of my life.  (I am 60.) A tad expensive (which is why only four stars) but small enough to be convenient, bright enough to be useful and efficient enough to be inexpensive to operate.I bought these flashlights for use during blackouts but their convenience has me using them for illumination whenever I am fiddling around with cables behind the TV or under the office desk or inside the computer.  The small size means they are easy to hold in an armpit or in the same hand as another tool.I also bought the red-LED version for use in the car so as not to affect night vision
Smith  Wesson is an American arms maker. The flashlight also got solid construction and reasonable weight. The more important aspect is that it uses two AA batteries, which are easy to find and economical. It came with two Energizer AA batteries. Three white LEDs are bright enough for general purposes. I keep it in my car's glove box.
I purchased this item as a gift for my mother.  She has a huge outdoor swimming pool and will use it as a changing room for all of her grandkids.  She's very happy that her new floors won't be ruined by everyone coming inside dripping wet to change after swimming
Good knife to throw in your survival kit. Compass is worthless but other than that it seemed well made
PowerBars were created out of necesity to be efficient, not to taste like a $2.50 gourmet treat similar alot of other bars that have since come out. If you want something that has a food like texture and tastes like food - eat food; like a steak, a piece of cake, or a banana. Power bars were made for energy in the 1980's; people who eat them now got used to them and now actually like them. Power Bars are practically synonymous with the term "energy bar" because they are the time honored benchmark. Try a Cliff Bar or a Snickers if you are looking for something tasty; when you get tired of those and long for something more in life, try a powerbar
Hey,I decided to review some things I didn't buy off Amazon, but I have owned for sometime that are really great items: the kind I would buy again for sure if they were lost. I would say lost or broken, but Jansport has lifetime warranties! If anything happens to your backpack, all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem, they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you. They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon. Overall, these are such great products, you just have to get a Jansport if you're thinking of a backpack.Also, I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful, which I hope it really is, I would love to have your yes vote!With Care, Sa
This is the second time that I purchased this backpack. The first time was over 5 years ago when my son was starting highschool.  Now he is a 2nd year student in college and it is time to replace the original one.  Why not get the bag that has lasted so long
If you have ever been caught at a check out desk or some place in need of a pen and no one has one, then this knife is for you.  The other day I was at the check out line of the supermarket, and when I went to sign the credit slip, I couldn't as the casher has lost her pen.  I then whipped out my keychain with this on it and quickly signed the form and was on my way.I highly recommend it for situations like this
I have bought over 20 of these knives.  I trim my nails, open packages, write notes, tighten screws, and strip wire (great for stripping wire).  You can buy replacement toothpicks and pens.  I put toothpicks in place of the twizzers.  I have never used the twizzers in 30 years.  I can use the toothpick a couple times a day.  I would love to see a thinner version with an LED, toothpick and pen. Airport security keeps taking my knives.  Remember to remove the pen and toothpick if they do take it.  The pen just pulls out. This is the best most used tool I have ever owned
Excellent product.  Great for home use as it folds up and slides right under the bed.  The height is adjustable and it breaks down and stores quickly. Very good quality materials for the price.  I have had my eye on one in the in-flight magazine when I travel but I saved a lot of money buying it here especially since they included free shipping
I am a Reiki practitioner and purchased this table because it is easy to transport and very affordable.  The table is nice and sturdy, sets up and breaks down easily and is lighter than some other models out on the market.  A good value for the money
This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have use it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car
I purchased this snorkel equipment for a vacation in Aruba and I used it for 4 days of snorkeling.  I had always rented snorkel gear before and this was the first time I decided to purchase a set.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  The fins are fantastic.  The design of this fin from US Divers with the split in the middle makes it extremely easy to move through the water - it's a great design feature!  The snorkel mask was comfortable and it never leaked.  The set also comes with a great blue and gray backpack that you can store all of your gear in
I bought one of these a while back to use as a day pack for hiking. I find it an absolutely great backpack. It has enough compartments for everything I need to carry as well as a ton of smaller pockets for nick knacks and smaller items.I found I didn't need the waist belt and never used it as it doesn't do much. (It's not like your trying to get weight to your hips with a small pack like this anyways. I ended up cutting it off. It has a nice carry handle at the top built into the harness that makes it real easy to carry this pack or move it around with one hand when not wearing it.The padding on the back is very comfortable, I haven't overloaded this pack yet, but with about 15-20 pounds, it's very easy to wear.It has straps for a skateboard/snowboard, and while I've never used it for those, They make nice straps to lash things on if you wanted to. I also like the cell phone pocket, which I actually do use for a cell phone. I liked that so much that I zip tied my folding knife pocket exactly opposite it.One downfall for me was the 2 side pockets. Usually used for water bottles . They are quite small. my nagaline 32 oz bottles won't fit in there, though no problem with smaller sizes. The pack is able to be used as a camel back, though I didn't see a bladder specifically made for it.So in the end, I just bought another one of these for a friends birthday and I'm really impressed with it. I would definatly recomend this pack.
My daughter received this toy for Christmas and at seven weeks old, immediately loved it. My five-month old nephew also received one and loves it as well. It is easy for infants to grab and soft so they don't hurt themselves when they pull it towards their face and mouth. The colors are visually engaging and it has a "nice" rattle sound to it (loud enough to get the child's attention, not too loud to be an annoying toy). I recommend this toy for anyone shopping for a shower or birthday gift.
This is the same toy I was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle. The women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store. Awesome toy for infants since it's light, easy to grip, and easy to bit. My son loved this toy for 2-3 months until he was old enough to move on to bigger heavier toys
This was the first toy my son picked up and put in his mouth at 3 months.  I think he liked it because it is very light and easy to grab on to.  He has found it so entertaining, and I especially appreciated that in his first months when there wasn't a lot I could do with him.  Now I try to include it with all of my baby shower gifts!
 deep gouges caused by feet of sofa where all finish was off  in  2   6"x9" areas were discovered during move-out; this product saved us from complete refinishing of otherwise gorgeous oak floors.  simply rubbed the felt-like stick over the area, and the gouges seemed to "fill in"!applied 2 more layers, and were amazed! couldn't tell where they were.  
Extra heavy, somewhat difficult to assemble.  Good quality.  Will hold 24 rods but not with reels attached, more like 12 rods/reel combos
