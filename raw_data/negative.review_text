I have bought and returned three of these units now. Each one has been defective, and finally I just gave up on returning the system. The DVD player constantly gives "Bad Disc" errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc. The sound quality is very nice for the price, but since the player doesn't work, it's essentially useless. This is a complete rip-off at any price point
I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups, and the last 5 or so failed. I thought it was my software, so I got new software. Guess what? My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration
I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online. Well, I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs, I got one that burned good. Not much bang for the buck. I have burned many discs but never Memorex, usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM. Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters. Maybe my burners don't like them but whatever the case, I won't buy them ever again. I thought Memorex made good products
The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality. The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one. I'm using the Plextor DVD burner (love it!!), but I'm going to try my luck with a different DVD brand. The failure rate for Memorex is unacceptable. It's less the cost that bothers me, but more the time wasted on burning coasters
Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised!  To date, I've been denied twice.  The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode!  I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, "All required products were not submitted."  Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint.The product itself is average.  I've used better and worse.  That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price
No free lunch  you get what you pay for...is that the verdict on this product?Well, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it.  I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey.  Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership).  But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause.....  So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business.  Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product..
This card is such a disappointment.  It is soooo sloooooow.  I use it for my digital camera, mp3 player, and ipaq.  It takes forever to copy anything to and from it
Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera. It worked for 2 days.After that, everytime I on the camera, it wanted me to reformat the card,WTH is that?Now I can't use it at all....I'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon.One mistake I made,I threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card, thought It worked and It would be OK.I can no longer return it now.Needless to say,I'm too over confident with LEXAR's products.Buyers beware...
As the other reviewer found out, these cards can't be formatted to work with SD Audio.  Total waste of money
I purchased dvd express and it never worked. I spent endless time with tech support. The old story about, "It must be your computer." did not fly either, my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS. I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it. Same problems. Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product. They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones. My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money. ADS also told me it would not work with Ulead's Movie Factory 3, some of the software it came bundled with, but that was Uleads problem. I should use Cap Wiz ( Their program ) DUH!!! Guess what, it did not work with their program either. Ulead said they had several complaints with ADS's product. Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work. Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product! P.S. Since ADS doesn't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade. I don't think they want a product like that either. The only reason I gave one star is.....it was packed well.JU
When I purchased these batteries, I was very pleased, but that wore off after a couple of months. I don't use my camera all that often, but when I do, I expect ther batteries to have some charge. I recharge them per instructions, and they do not hold a charge any longer.I know Monster makes good products, but I am a little disappointed in this one
You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9.95 on this very site.   I did.  They work great.  Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries.  Ridiculous
I wish I never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks.  If you put a textbook on it and turn the page, it collapses and or tears the page.  I wouldn't even use this for a notebook.  
We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up
Bought new around $80.  CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 months--now nap function and radio are all that works--if only I could find the damn receipt!!!
In the ten minutes since I've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off.  More importantly, It can't handle large manuals as advertised.  (The reason I purchased this particular book holder)  My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter.  Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages.  If you don't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on, keep an eye on the page retainers (these are the parts that fell off) and you should be ok.  As for me, I'm off to read Amazon's return policy and see if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic
This is the worst thing I have ever owned!!!! It broke (said there were no cd's inside) after about a week! Do yourself a favor don't get this product, don't buy this brand and don't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card. But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem.Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader. 
Pros: Perfect sound, solved resampling issuesCons: famous popping/crackling noises makes it useless for gaming, especially in BF2 (which use OpenAL by Creative). Crystallizer is useless.This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20% of high end systems, not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset, but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards: see Google for "X-Fi popping/crackling".  Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately, you have a good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change. For long time  Creative denied existence of this problem. Eventually it was recognized (see official CL forums) and a new driver (since November 2005!) was promised at the end of May 2006, but beta version published 05/30/06 did not solve my problem. In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial "hacked" drivers. I suspect that X-Fi crackling is an architecture design flow, which cannot be completely solved at software level, because PCI bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the "the fastest sound processor" simultaneously with high end graphic card, HD controller, and other devices. Bottom end: I have to stop playing games, or go back to low quality integrated sound. Do not take risk, wait for working drivers, or buy a working card from different manufacturer. With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars.UPDATE 06/12/2006I found that many desktop motherboards (MB) have really slow south bridge (south bridge is connecting PCI, USB, Firewire, and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge), especially MBs with NVidia chipsets (and even with some Intel MBs). New beta X-Fi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases (but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4G-SATA2, nVidia 6100 / 410 MCP chipset), but situation is still marginal and X-Fi might go unstable again. I contact CL customer service, they did not solved the problem, but pointed out that ATI chipsets (Athlon 64, ATI 200 or 3200) have no problems with X-Fi. I decided not to return SB to seller, but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB. I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCI-X (even NVidia based) also should be fine with X-Fi. The trouble is that majority of X-Fi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me. So I can give X-Fi two stars instead of 1 (but I cannot change the rating), and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release (if it will work)
About three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend  told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off,  I've used all of them,  had their (file removal) tech help give up.In this day  age of "just make the item" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn't, I use an actual sandisk card, myself.If they ever (Lexar) made it right, I may have written a better review, but they haven't. So that tells me that they don't care.How important are your pictures to you?Frederic
Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
The card worked fine for my son's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother's wedding and I lost all the photos from that event.  I still can't believe it happened.  If you have an iPod, or other, remember to back-up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this
got it at walmart can't even remove a scuff. i give it -100 good thing i could return it
Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD.  After the "repair" process the entire disk was unplayable.  Took it back for a refund. With billions of CDs in the world, is this the best that the 21st century has to offer?
This SD would not work in my  Nikon  Coolpix S6 camera (but the Fuji and Sandisk product did
I bought this card for my TJ25, supposedly a supported device. But the problems with this card make it nearly useless:- It comes with a web browser that doesn't work.- Even if the browser DID work, it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full version.- The only downloadable browser that works with the card is Eudora, which doesn't do anything except display text (you can't even fill in web forms with it, so webmail, searches, etc. are impossible).- The card is designed to work with NetFront and CLIE Mail, software that comes with Internet-enabled CLIE devices... obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card. These programs are not available separately.- The card wouldn't connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors', even though my PowerBook has no trouble connecting to either, no additional configuration required.- While attempting to connect, the card would often stop responding, and then lock up the handheld.Bottom line: if you want a web-enabled PDA, buy a web-enabled PDA. Don't buy this
i've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this CD, the sound from my system did seem to be a little better (the CD's were not skipping as much).  but the bottom line is it didn't fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably, although not as bad as before.  ... not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6-disk CD changer
I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB compact flash card.I like it, but the flash card doesn't slide in easily. Sometimes it get stuck halfway, as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins.To add insult to injury, both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk. Therefore, they SHOULD work seamlessly together, but pathetically, they don't.I'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great, rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing.For comparison, my camera accepts the card perfectly. There is no give at all, but instead is an effortless process.Not a quality reader.Other than that, it works as expected. Surprisingly, the reader doesn't topple over as easily as I thought it would. It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in. Sliding the card in a 2 handed process, so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in.Removing the card is extremely easy. That's a one-handed process. "Eject" the card from the PC's drive and then remove it.Data transfer from the card to PC is very quick.Overall, I'm glad to have it, but it's an annoyance to use it. I hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader
Some of the worst DVDs that I have purchased. I wouldn't waste my money on any more of these POS discs. I wish I could return them to amazon, but for what I paid (it was pretty cheap), its not worth the effort.
If they weren't free, I'd give them 1 star.  Media code: MCC 01RG20.  2 of 10 were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008
I purchased my tv in Dec 2004. I did not purchase the extended warranty. These sets are have all kinds of video problems. Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home service. The service company is QUALXSERV in home service. They want $350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty, and can not guarantee a fix. Take it from me buy some other Bran
The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution
The extendable arm breaks very easily.  I had two of them and they both broke within the first month.  The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement.  Very poor product.  Do not buy
Do NOT buy this product.  It is incredibly slow, by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that I've used.  It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files.  I attempted to copy ~50MB (1500 files, 800 directories) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy!  That's roughly 27K/second.  Deleting the files was painful as well, taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything.  For kicks, I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds.  Bottom line is don't be fooled by the drive's small physical size, large capacity and price point: it simply doesn't perform
I wanted to replace a Lexar 1GB with this, but I'll keep looking. I used it to transfer a 700MB, 2300 file My Documents folder to a new PC. The transfer seemed pretty slow, but deleting those files from the Sandisk took *61* minutes! Back it goes

I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.  The first unit I received would not turn on at all.  I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead.  Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit.The replacement stereo arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing.  After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf stereo that I own, here are my thoughts.1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length.  The Philips stereo, however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception.  This did not happen with the Sony stereo.2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos, I found that the Philips stereo had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3.  The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality.  Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips stereo, making "S" sounds sound more like "H" sounds.  I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input.3. The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good.  For one thing, the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped.  If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove.  The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3.  The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening.  This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting.  Finally, the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it).I am in the process of returning this stereo, and I will try to find a Sony system instead.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago.  I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly.  Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos?  The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs. 
 I have to rate this product and this company as horrible!!I purchased the X2 in 12/2004. Everything was fine. In 6/2005, the lamp blew. Less than 300 hours on it!!! I called the company. They said sometimes it happens. I questioned the projector. They said I just needed a new lamp. $300.00 later.....oh, you can only get the lamps from them. You can only get service on the X2 from them.I get the new lamp. It just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be. Additionally, the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew. Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago (when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldn't look at it!!!) No. They say no.The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place. The projector was blown clean on a regular basis. This projector was not mistreated or misused.Infocus says "sometimes this happens".They, for $250, plus $30.00 shipping, will fix the fan. I also need to buy a new lamp-another $300. The company keeps saying-"It is out of warranty", "sometimes this happens", "1400 hours is just what some lamps get", etc., etc,. etc.. They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product.I will get a new projector-I can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one. My new projector WILL NOT/WILL NEVER be an Infocus product.They have failed to stand behind their product. Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties.Don't buy Infocus!!!
Good product, forget about service. I e-mailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005it is now 7th January 2006 and I still do not have my projector. That's right, it's been ONE YEAR sincemy projector stopped working, I have given up on it being repaired (it was under warranty) and am nowstruggling to get it back so that I can repair it out of my own pocket. Check this company's record at the Better Business Bureau, it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints
I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries, but like other reviewers I've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast.  I'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AA's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AA's lasted only a week.Be warned that these aren't quite the bargain they may initially seem
The worst customer service I have ever experienced. The lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor said:"You got it cheaper than other brands, what else do you expect?" "Viking cheats. So what?
This was a great mouse for about the first year I owned. After one year is when all of the problems started.  The mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesn't want to connect at all.  I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesn't seem to help.  It is very tempremental, and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacement.So, a word to the wise - in my experience the mouse will work great for a while, just be prepared to replace it in a year or so
Beware of this product.  It always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer.  I have another USB 1.0 card reader that works perfectly.  I upgrade to get the speed boost with USB 2.0, but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy
This remote is so hard to use and setup. The Xpress functions don't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time. Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons, instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers. Get something else
I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I did the research on this product and it was one of the best. I don't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use. I have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included. One if not the only reason I had purchased it. I e-mailed tiger.com and received no reply. If your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way
You will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same. This is my main problem - the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there.1 - The speakers are lightweight and shoddily built. They sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about. They are fairly light weight - meaning very small magnets in them. These are 3 way speakers - for really good sound on the cheap - speakers need to be 2 way!2 - The sound input consists of a headphone type jack in FRONT. Not even standard phono inputs at the back.3 - Its advertised as 320 watts - which is meaningless - since the speakers suck. What good is a high power amp with crappy speakers. And in case you know some audio - 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts (log relationship). For some reason, this is not even half as loud as my 100 W receiver!4 - No user adjustable equalizer, only presets possible5 - Cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the "biamping" type of connections.6 - The receiver sucks - even my Sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver.I concur with the other reviewer - Death to Sony! Shame on them for taking consumers for a ride. This company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it "Competively" with the others - meaning - fat profit margins.
...I'm so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases. They were great, a HARD cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside (that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center). Somebody could have sat on it and it would've been fine..
I mean seriously guys, is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card. There is an easier way to do it ya know. For your psp, if the game is really important to you and you can't save it. Just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off..it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again.. just push it back up..and hopefully if you did it right you'll have the game right back in the place you left it..hey it saved me 50 dollars..and it can do the same thing for yo
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is "admin". Well, it is not. Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in.The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted. After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang). This box is going back. I already bought a Buffalo that works fine
This thing is JUNK!!!  Don't waste your money.  I am a computer professional and I had it working for about 5 minutes, then after powering it down and back up it never did work again!  If you buy one, go through the setup and if it doesn't work immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON!  Don't waste your precious time trying to get a $70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time.Finally, Amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged. However, YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES. If the product is in fact good it won't have many bad reviews, or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional. However, look up all the bad reviews for this product. They should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product
I have had this printer for more than a year.  At first, it was a great printer. Not anymore!!  It uses up ink like no other, yes, it is great to have the individual tanks(which is why I bought the thing) but now the print head isn't working right.  Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up, and the problem is still there.  The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed.  Went to the canon website, they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed.My recommendation is don't buy this model!!
This printer prints fast but the quality is poor. Consumer reports rates it a best buy but I disagree. Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer. I do not recommend this printer to anyone. I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the Cannon. This purchase was a real dissapointment
Notice, all the happy....five star ratings, are from people that JUST bought this MP3. I have had mine for 9 months. I have had this MP3 since Christmas 2005. I bought the white 512 for my son at the same time. Whith in 3 weeks, my son's was no longer working at all, he had it in his back pack, and some how it got crunched enough to never work again!! I was not happy. Also in a few months, mine started to have issues. The very "tiny" menu button is rediculous. And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony. I accually removed the cover to the toggle, and just moved the joy stick under it, to change songs, or volume. How stupid. I am so mad about this MP3 player. I am going to buy a Creative V. I have done a lot of research this time, and I will not buy another Sony. The hold button, that is part of this sliding door never works, I find the player dead in my gym bag, all the time!!! Apparently, the door slides over a bit, and the player will turn on, FOR HOURS, and than you have a dead player. Maybe Sony should have given us a on/off button, than this would not happen! Dont do it folks, look into other options, even my mom's iPod Nano is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player.
First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have toadvise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacementinsurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphonesalways pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!!
I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn't allow for more photos after only using 40mb. I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP. It doesn't allow it to be formatted. Bad investment!!! Would not recommend the product unless there is a way I can get a refund or an exchange
Very unreliable .......... I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders.  I find that they.....1) don't last....get about 50 re-recordings NOT 1500  2) may crap out on any occasion.......multiple CD RW's with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers.AVOID MEMOREX DVD RW   CD RW DISKS!
Was a little hard putting it together.  You have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart.  I am not happy with this product
I have had a Canon G2 since 2002. I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem. In October 2004, I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon. I did not use it until this summer. After I had taken 20 more photos and reviewed, I immediately found a few images corrupted. No matter how I tried, e.g. format the CF before use, there were alway corrupted images.I wonder if I can return the defect CF card and get a replacement from Amazon or from manufacturer?SherwoodL.A. count
Heres a new one....I have recently bought two spindles of these discs, and my computer (Imac w/ Intel chip-hardly outdated) simply doesnt recognize them-like I never put in a disc at all.  The kicker is that this spring, I also ordered two spindles of these discs (exactly the same as far as I can tell), from which I burned one hundred discs (not a single faulty one!) for a freind overseas.  I have no idea what the deal is, but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs.  Anyone got ideas?
The card works as advertised but SanDisk does not send in Mail-in-Rebate. Even though I mailed it in with the UPC Barcode, SanDisk sent me a post card stating that I needed to resubmit it with the barcode. How can I resubmit when they already have the barcode?In my experience with SanDisk, I got rebate back on one of two cards that I submitted - so you get mail-in rebate 50% of the time with SanDisk. I think mail-in-rebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies. Don't trust it!
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied - until last week when it stopped functioning altogether.  I really expected a better product and durability from Microsoft.  I've since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it.
This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made. It felt very light and flimsy, the definition of cheap plastic. Not just the construction but the performance was terrible. It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes. This was very very frustrating. Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one, but I wouldn't take that chance again.I wish I could give this device a worse rating, somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate.
I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x.  Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner.  So if you are looking for 16x, do not buy this one
It's been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512MB Transflash card was "shipped" from EMARTBUY and I still have not received my order. When I contacted EMARTCRAP, all they could tell me was that it had been shipped. I am sure that flash card works great. I just hope that I will receive it before it becomes obsolete. AVOID EMARTBUY AT ALL COST. Don't settle for incompetency. Your are better off paying a higher price for better service...correction any service
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for
I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cd's/dvd's.  I can't give a complete review of the product because I only tried to repair 1 dvd... and it did not repair it
How do I assign a rating? As several other people have experienced, my unit is also DOA. I received it, plugged it in, pressed 'clean', and the motor started up. I popped open the cover, put in the disc I wanted cleaned, and pressed 'clean' again. Nothing. Terrible quality control.What's worse is the unit case is glued together -- no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty
I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer. I wasnt impressed. I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up. I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three "processes" without successful results. It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs. I dont think this is a good "repairer" of any disc thats more than mildly scratched. My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON!! Many of my CDs I have replaced for $7-10 bucks on here. I wish I wouldve kept my $25
I purchased this flash card in June for my GPS memory. Loaded fine, but only lasted 3 months. Card lost all it's memory and was unable to take a new load. Very disappointed in the life of the card.
As with some of the other reviewers, mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter.  I bought a Vector brand inverter at Wal-Mart and it is much better
This item worked for a while, but required fiddling (unplugging and replugging repeatedly) with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car.  Eventually, however, it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets.  Don't waste your money on this piece of crap
The product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car.  The mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it.  I have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail.  I will not purchase another thing from Amazon until my money is refunded
About a year ago I got one of these to allow me to play DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling.  It has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low -- well it sounded immediately .  I figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs.  I hadn't tried to use it since.  Now that I'm taking another trip, I thought I'd try it out in other cars.  No luck.  The thing is dead -- doesn't do a thing when I plug it in
Each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data.  Don't waste your money on this one
When this adapter first arrived, I thought it was great. The sound quality was excellent, and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitter-style adapter (there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area). The first day, I used it for about 20 minutes total (didn't have far to drive), and it worked great. The second day I had a bit farther to drive. After about 30 minutes, it quit. Hasn't worked again since.I didn't expect it to last forever, but less than an hour?Yes, it has a 1 year warranty: just send the unit back with a money order ($6) to cover the return postage. Of course, then you're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit..
I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it.  I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try.  I was excited that I had all my ipod music with me, BUT after less than a week it the sound  started going down hill to a point where I couldn't listen anymore with it.  It is now in a landfill somewhere.  My guess is I will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable.  For now just have the radio and CDs I burn
No kidding!!  The shipping charge on these batteries was over $6.00.  Amazon doesn't itemize the shipping charges on your order, so if you order multiple items, you won't know that you're being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late!
Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
These Xtreme cd cases STINKs,literally! I don't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic, but the smell is absolutely nauseous. I kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away. Nope. Finally I threw it away. Other than the smell, quality-wise it is ok. 
In theory an excellent product -- room for lots of disks, relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these (2 for me 1 for a friend) I can't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers, making  it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness. (...). All in all, a disappointment
I've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row.  I've spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks. 
This isn't a consistent product. 99% of the time, I can't get it to work. After MONTHS of emails and phone calls, customer service responded. What a joke! They told me the plug in the unit and then unplug, wait 30 seconds, and then plug in. Gimme a break! I shouldn't have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work. By the way, their process didn't work. Poor product, Poor customer service, Poor price
I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff.I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally.
I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it. This is a horrible controller. I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two, in that time you love it...but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with. The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment. I swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity. I'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isn't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade. It can spoil a good game of halo in an instant. Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver. Which takes about 10 dear seconds. After the contoller started breaking down, i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air. This controller is [...] and don't bother picking it up.
I bought this item not to cool my laptop, but to provide some insulation from the heat when it's on my lap sitting in a chair. I'm very satisfied with it's being able to accomplish that. HOWEVER, the cord ended up breaking after a few months. Targus replaced it at no charge which is good, but still a hassle. Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on. After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first.
The is perhaps the lease durable item I have purchased in 40 years. It lights up just fine, and it is a reassuring led gold, but it refuses to do anything with my xd card. It worked just fine for 3-4 days, then erased about 100 photos, all of them irreplaceable. Cheap yes, but Cheap Junk.
The DVDs are a rip-off, although I'm counting on the REBATE to at least break even (not counting my time).The DVD player completely fails to recognize them.  Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue....  Just a poor product -- Velocity ought to be ashamed.  More Taiwanese junk.  (I'd recommend Verbatim's DVD+R DL product - made in Singapore)As a note I can get other DVD-Rs to work just fine...I haven't submitted the rebate yet, so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments
I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesn't work.  This stuff is junk.  In addition, the manufacturernever sent the rebate.  Don't buy anything from Velocity
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card. But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem.Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader. 
What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.  I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it.  I go back home (OK) and it still does not work.  Apple said for $113 they'll fix.  Gee thanks!  I'll be looking at another brand!  Apple stinks
Maybe if these were high end rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price. But for Alkaline? This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell. You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price
But I won't because I paid good money for it.  As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files.  I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing. Stay away.. or if you really want one, buy mine please
I'm the consumer of SanDisk USB flash drives. I have used couple of sandisk flash drives (i.e. 512MB Mini, 256MB Mini) before I bought this product. Performance wise this particular product is not doing good. It's taking long time to copy files from my computers. Even it's taking long time to delete files from this disk. So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk.I doubt all the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB. Now I'm planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drive.  Better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product
Overall the recorder worked OK. A moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded DVDs could not be finalized for unexplained reasons.However, that is irrelevant now. A few weeks ago, the unit stop working. I does not turn on at all. What a waist! It is out of warranty now
Product :  	MP3 Players Sansa M200 Series Sansa m240We Received Your Item :  	11/03/2006Customer Comments : 11/13/2006 07:51 am   	When will I get my repaired or replaced item. You have had this for 1 week without notifying me of the status. Please respond (by the way, Apple turns around iPod repairs in 1 DAY!).11/13 Still waiting for an update on the M240 you received on 11/3
No where near as easy to use as my old system ,But with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your Projects.But one interesting thing someone mentioned earlieris that regardless of with system you use these labels can alterthe way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks,burner or what..after some experimenting I didconfirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making...It might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing..Dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie
I connected all the cables as instructed, but it doesn't work, the light is not on.So I return it to Amazon
These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration !! otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card. There is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality.I have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Acceleration !!Very Few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity ( 12x ) at 1/4 the mentioned price. SO why pay more if your camera does not support this technology !
Let's be honest.This product ain't cheap. It's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working. I bought mine at cpenusa.com. Delivery was great, only took them a couple of days. However, my c-pen cable was damaged. The connector to the c-pen was, for some reason, cut in half. Without it, you can't recharge or connect the c-pen to the pc.I called their main office all the way in Sweden during the office hours. NO RESPONSE. I sent three e-mails to cpenusa. NO RESPONSE.I don't care if the product itself is great(I'll never know now, will I..). If you're unable to receive support when you need 'em, you're screwed. If you're just interested in electronic equipments, just want to try things out and don't really care if you're on your own, go ahead and try it. Let me know how this thing really is. Otherwise, buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after-sales support
 I have to rate this product and this company as horrible!!I purchased the X2 in 12/2004. Everything was fine. In 6/2005, the lamp blew. Less than 300 hours on it!!! I called the company. They said sometimes it happens. I questioned the projector. They said I just needed a new lamp. $300.00 later.....oh, you can only get the lamps from them. You can only get service on the X2 from them.I get the new lamp. It just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be. Additionally, the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew. Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago (when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldn't look at it!!!) No. They say no.The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place. The projector was blown clean on a regular basis. This projector was not mistreated or misused.Infocus says "sometimes this happens".They, for $250, plus $30.00 shipping, will fix the fan. I also need to buy a new lamp-another $300. The company keeps saying-"It is out of warranty", "sometimes this happens", "1400 hours is just what some lamps get", etc., etc,. etc.. They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product.I will get a new projector-I can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one. My new projector WILL NOT/WILL NEVER be an Infocus product.They have failed to stand behind their product. Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties.Don't buy Infocus!!!
The worst customer service I have ever experienced. The lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor said:"You got it cheaper than other brands, what else do you expect?" "Viking cheats. So what?
This item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of Casio Exilim camera, but was never delivered. Now Amazon wants me to review it, so here your are..
This is a good product - sounds great, gets good battery life, everything you'd hope for in an iPod dock.  But it has one major flaw.  The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves.  After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars.  But without that, it simply breaks quickly, and no longer performs its only job - to sound good.
Luckily, I didn't pay a penny for the motorized SkipDr. as it was given to us as a "prize." I have the original (manual) SkipDr. which worked every time, and I always end up using it instead. It has more than paid for itself in repaired CD's--$20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang.The motorized version didn't come with any deep scratch sanding pads, which I need about 25% of the time for a badly scratched disc. Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine, and won't start turning, so I have to squeeze it together to make it work
One of the most essential buttons on any remote is the Channel + button and it did not work straight out of the box.  I returned it.Beyond that, setting it up takes time but is not difficult.  I am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out
This is a poorly designed remote. I have six devices connected to my HD television set. The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and, in my case, routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote. I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly. At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV (which cannot turn the TV on and off).
I have two Ni-MH chargers and sony batteries won't charge in them. They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers. They force you to buy their own non-standard charger that probably won't again charge other brand batteries. And of course this is not mentioned anywhere. No wonder these batteries are the cheapest. Don't waste your money or support Sony's attempt to bring non-standard products into a standardized market. Soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough
Once again I'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product.  These are terribly uncomfortable (for my ears) and don't really provide that great of listening experience. The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible "surrounds", and then they become distractingly uncomfortable.  But of course, this is just my experience, your mileage may vary, as they say.  Personally, I found my Apple iPod 'phones to be better
I am disappointed in this product.I was suppose to write to you from the weekend.My two rear speakers just stop working, and also myremote control. I have replace the batteries, but stilldoes not work.I don't have any other rear speakers to try on the system.Pleasy me what to do.Thank youEpiphane Flaviu
while the verbatim has burned well in 100% of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players
I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This media did not work on my brand new asus burner, even after updating the firmware
Can capture analog video and produce cd-rom's but I expected the ability to produce DVD
I bought this to record Tivo DVR stuff to DVD.  Worst frame rate capture and audio capture of .avi's of the four different devices I have tried.  Completely unusable.  The software is a trial version.  Instead, buy the ADS DVDXpress DX2 for a bit more.  Ulead's software is stable, and it's not a trial version.  It is also the only analog capture device I have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture.  Pinnacle's Dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space, but the software is way too buggy
I got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term, risky cells.It could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but I'mnot willing to chance it again
If these were free, i'd still would not recommend them, due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings.It is the discs, I must assume, since my burner works fine with other brands.Anyway, (now) I think it's best to invest a bit more and get good media..
I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS
I had this card for more than 6 months, and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510. Transfers went well too. Then all of a sudden for no reason I kept getting "card error" on my computer and digital camera a week ago. My SD/USB converter couldn't find the card either. I had really good photos I wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good. What a joke
I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago.  What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback.  I agree that it could have been better.  It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last.  You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore. 
This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place.  The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the "hold" feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off.  The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod.  I finally just gave up on it and returned it.  I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag.  I think I'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options.  Was this thing even meant for the Gen 2 nano
The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is "admin". Well, it is not. Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in.The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted. After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang). This box is going back. I already bought a Buffalo that works fine
I ordered the 2-year service plan on May 1st, this day (July 31st), I still have not recievied it. I have contacted them a number of times, and still nothing.  Do not buy from this company
I purchased this item and one month later I still have not received any paperwork. I emailed and have not received a reply
This is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons.1. This hub will not work with any USB powered devices. So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub.2. Extremely slow USB 1.1. This device is NOT USB 2.0 compliant3. It is clunky4. Does not comke with a power adapte
Wasted my money for this SLOW hub...Be aware that if you want to connect your printer, scanner, ipod etc. to this device, think again
i purchased the DLO action jacket (neoprene for 20  40GB ipods) for my wife for use on walks, etc around town.  However, the ipod doesn't fit in properly.  The circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod's doesn't.  The plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and doesn't align either so you can't press the play button.  So, since the ipod doesn't fit in the case overall, this product is useless.  pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case
I have had this printer for more than a year.  At first, it was a great printer. Not anymore!!  It uses up ink like no other, yes, it is great to have the individual tanks(which is why I bought the thing) but now the print head isn't working right.  Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up, and the problem is still there.  The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed.  Went to the canon website, they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed.My recommendation is don't buy this model!!
I suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive.  Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room.  The sound is so-so and it has no battery backup, lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing.  It is also very big, taking up 1/2 my nightstand.  The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live.  This morning I finally gave in, accepted reality and tossed it in the trash.  I won't miss it at all
We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up
I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice
I had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds. The sound quality was good, but the dependability of this item is questionable.
Good thing first, efficient on battery,convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge. Thats it.As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY. utterly non user friendly.I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software...even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy..I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer. Then one day my computer HDD crashed. I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman. Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste.As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back...I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me( a very indifferent group of people). It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money.Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that..It is absolutely infuriating
I have an Iriver T10 and there is virtually no software to support the USB plug and play interface that Mac owners have always expected.Pay a little more and buy an IPOD.  It interfaces with PCs and Macs equally well.
First of all, the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself.  I did get it quickly (2 or 3 days), but I had several problems with it:(1) I repeatedly tried it on my DVD player and the player hung.  Each time I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond.  I tried over 10 times and got the same result each time.(2) I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well.  Had to Ctrl-Alt-Del to get my DVD player software to close.  On the 3rd attempt it actually did work.(3) I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computer. Each time I got a message saying "no disk".I consider it item a waste of money
cases very cheaply made. Break when opening. Not worth shipping cost waste of money
It is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them.  On the flip side once they have been opened once, they don't reclose very well
Very unreliable .......... I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders.  I find that they.....1) don't last....get about 50 re-recordings NOT 1500  2) may crap out on any occasion.......multiple CD RW's with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers.AVOID MEMOREX DVD RW   CD RW DISKS!
I have the older, larger version of this product. However, it uses the same software. The labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great, but the software is awful. There is no direct Macintosh program; rather there are templates. They were written for old versions of software and really don't work right. The Windows side includes an actual Print Shop-style program which works awfully. If you do get this, make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint
They totally misrepresent this product. It does not work with Macs. I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex, shame on you
after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement.  of course you want a hard copy, that is why you bought it. just do it.
Okay,This is not a review of the product itself. But, I stronglyencourage you to consider not getting an N.E.W warranty. They arereally not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things. If you had anything to do with the device not working (e.g. you dropped it, forget about it they aint gonna fix/replace it whatever.) They have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginia(of course you have to pay for the shipping!)Lastly, they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an N.E.W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know N.E.W will take months to pay them for the work they did.If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it
N.E.W. will waste your time, money, and your every last nerve before repairing your product.  Eventually they will, but not without an exhausting, protracted fight
I'm not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty some-odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a $40 rebate.  But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic, your voice doesn't come through the speaker.  I'm cool with the machine's sound quality when it comes to playing a CD-G.  If I tap the mic, I can hear an extremely faint thud, so I know it's on, but the volume's too low--and, yes, I adjusted the mic controls--if you want to sing along. Which makes this a dinosaur: a boom box in the age of the iPod.  Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadn't been opened.  So, when was my first clue?  Doh
I used to like my Viking 512MB CF card a lot.  I had such a card for more than a year.  In that period, I used it in my camera.  It's filled up for several times.  Also occationally I use a card reader (SimpleTech) to write/read that card, to transfer some big files between computers.  It's all fine, and suddenly one day, when the card was half full, and after a card reader reading, I got "CF card error" on my camera.  Fortunately, after I delete a few pictures, I could move on.  I gave the card to  other people, so I don't know how it's doing now.After that, I purchased another Viking 512MB, half year ago.  I used it to transfer files for a few times, and have never filled it up using my camera yet.  Now I am getting consistent "CF card error" message on my camera, even after re-format for several times, while I don't have that problem if I use another card.  One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card.  I can not verify though.  Anyway, I will have to buy another card now, and it won't be viking for this time.===== One month later =====I contacted with their customer support.  They gave me a number for return, and I mailed back my damaged CF card.  They sent back a new one in a week.  The new one is working fine so far.  The exchange was not difficult.  They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt.  They only verified the serial number.  That's good
I wish they had a rating for zero stars.  I bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters.  That's a 24% success rate.  I subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters.  Memorex has really gone downhill. 
I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online. Well, I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs, I got one that burned good. Not much bang for the buck. I have burned many discs but never Memorex, usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM. Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters. Maybe my burners don't like them but whatever the case, I won't buy them ever again. I thought Memorex made good products
I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied - until last week when it stopped functioning altogether.  I really expected a better product and durability from Microsoft.  I've since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it.
Being a graduate student and living in an apartment, I was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments.  It prints off things quite well and it is fast.  It does not, however, print 500 pages per month.  50-100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over $20, which is high considering how often you need to buy them.The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition. 
This card is such a disappointment.  It is soooo sloooooow.  I use it for my digital camera, mp3 player, and ipaq.  It takes forever to copy anything to and from it
Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera. It worked for 2 days.After that, everytime I on the camera, it wanted me to reformat the card,WTH is that?Now I can't use it at all....I'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon.One mistake I made,I threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card, thought It worked and It would be OK.I can no longer return it now.Needless to say,I'm too over confident with LEXAR's products.Buyers beware...
I record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media, software etc.- I'd been using Ridata for some time w/ next to no coasters but figured I'd upgrade and go with memorex this time around. Big mistake. They skip, pixelate and freeze up. I have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies I've done. Were it a compatibility issue I could understand, but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media. I'm going back to using my cheap disks! The lesson here is: " If it works, dont fix it!
I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co. didn't offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer HDTV (too many trees around my house).  I wasn't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable.  When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on.  I said it IS ON!! This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for).  So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter.  It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture.  Save your money.  If you can't get HDTV don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for
I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD.
Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully.  I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media.  Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well.  I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter.  I'd try something else
I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer. I wasnt impressed. I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up. I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three "processes" without successful results. It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs. I dont think this is a good "repairer" of any disc thats more than mildly scratched. My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON!! Many of my CDs I have replaced for $7-10 bucks on here. I wish I wouldve kept my $25
Not sure if I just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again. It worked right most of the time, but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button. I would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to "reset" and work correctly.  It's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working.Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for. Fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand
Hi! I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006, and was able to set the region code to "0" to watch all DVD's. After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks (and unplugging it), the region code has automatically set back to "1" and I cannot change it anymore! What happened?? When I try to change it now I can only choose between the settings "1" and "-". Anyone who has the same problem? Thank yo
As with some of the other reviewers, mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter.  I bought a Vector brand inverter at Wal-Mart and it is much better
AMAZON FAIL TO DELIVER ITEM WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME.  THE ITEM FAIL TO ARRIVE AND THEREFORE WE NEVER RECEIVED THE GOOD
The sound was great, but the DVD would lag every 10-15 seconds during any and all movies.  It drove me nuts. I had to return it.
This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need, but its mp3 player is really bad: Audio just pops before moving to a next song . It looks like what Philips' people just do in all of their electronics.  I really don't want to talk about this any more because William R. French and  A. Isaicu all talke about these problems
The Good:When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited.  I have been playing BF2 (Battlefield 2) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys. So it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game. The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that I have seen.  But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it.The Bad:The board is constructed well but don't expect this to replace your home keyboard.  The "Windows Keyset" that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with (I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard). In-game typing is difficult at best (with the gaming keysets). With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1/2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical (not staggered.. like U,J and M  keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other). The keys feel a little "cheap" .. When you push them down they don't bounce back as much.The Ugly:About 2 weeks after I purchases this board (and the BF2 keyset) 9 keys went completely dead.  I tried to reinstall the software, reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail.I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty base unit. DUH!  They are "reviewing my warranty" but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day. Maybe this post is premature but I don't think I am getting a new base unit.Conclusion:The expression "Great Idea, Bad Execution" holds true here. My opinion: Don't buy this board. Ideazon has too many issues, not enough support staff and a website that doesn't do anything but look good
It was a great product when it worked.  Sleek design, super user friendly, sharp image and easily unlock to all region.  Never had any problem loading or playing until last week.  Went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie.  Swallowed the DVD with it.  It would've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least
The player stopped working after only a few months - it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them.  That behavior started out as intermittent, but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go.  We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash.  Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping.  This one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether - what a waste.  Save your time and money and buy another machine
I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice
I bought these thinking they were a good deal but now I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. I bought 24 of these and one year later I have four left that will take any sort of charge. The ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each. I also have several high end chargers that don't want anything to do with the ones that died. On the bright side I have several Lenmar DLCRV3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been A+ after 2+ years
O.k., I purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now.  These batteries will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives.  I don't know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is, but these didn't last being on the shelf for a little over a year.  I will never buy this brand again
To be short, the performance is less than great but OK, but I can live with that since I have dozens of them, I don't care if it runs out faster. But what I couldn't stand if that it also set my charger on fire since one of them leaked, I couldn't imagine what would happen if I didn't come to my desk in time
I bought this as a travel charger for my Blackberry. All I can say is awful, awful, awful. I followed instructions in the manual (which are pretty easy) and charged up the Solio. After waiting twice as long as required, I tried to plug it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it charged--big mistake. Not only did it not charge a weird red "battery" icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed.I tried this routine several times over several days with the same result, rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous. Finally, I had enough and told the customer service for Solio that I was returning it. Not only did they never return my money (I had to call my CC company to handle it) no one ever said what the problem could be.My advice: Stay away from this thing--it may seen cool or environmentally friendly, but it is junk a piece of over-priced junk
C. Musselman can add 2 more cards to his connector problem.  I have gone through 2 desktop cards that do not have proper fittings for the external antenna - I plan to return it all.  Avoid this product
Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt work well at all. I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changer. Tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while. It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CD. Apparently Sony didn't do proper quality testing on this product. I returned mine and after these other reviews won't be replacing it with a Sony. I hope this is a message to Sony. 
There are brands I trust and ones I don't.  Sony has always been a trusted brand.  But after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken.  I should have read these other reviews before I made my purchase, but because this unit is a Sony I trusted it would be a superior product.  The problems I had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews: When playing CDs in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a CD and quitting.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the ONKYO DX C390 6 disc changer.  I am hoping I have better luck.
I recently bought my second of these. The first had a digital tuner. You had to get used to the feel. After about a year of use, one earphone went out. The one I just bought has an analogue tuner, and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high-powered pop (and around here, country) stations. The tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial. I can't believe Sony is charging $40.00 for this cheap piece of junk
I bought this for my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks. But, I soon found that it does not work well. After a few uses the gears began to stick. It would no longer crush/shave ice. Stick with the smaller units
Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl, my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer. The digital camera still works great--the printer is another matter. While this one prints beautiful pictures, the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes.As we all know, this is how printer companies make their money, through the ink. Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $75 at a time, give or take a few. The gray ink is used up the quickest, and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally. The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink, but for only about the first 50-70 pictures. After that. The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register--very frustrating when you're printing out any pictures, let alone ones of your child. Yes, we do what the manual sugests for such occasions, and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads, but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion. Every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to. In the long run, I will not be buying a photo printer for home use, but will rather take them to a store for processing. Quality-wise, it gets you in the beginning, but doesn't hold out for the long run. We have fiddled with it for two years. Enough's enough
My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas present for me. I installed it and it worked perfectly for one week. Then the colors started to change. Photos had extreme amount of yellow in them, such as yellow faces and hands, no proper flesh tones. I call HP support and was told that my printer was out of warranty because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured, not the purchase date. I was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had. I was given a case number, but when I called HP back stating my case number, they said that this was no longer a free call. I explained it was an extension of the first call, but they refused to work with me.I think HP warranty policy stinks, and would not purchase another HP product as long as this policy stands. 
This DVR works ok.  But when it is recording, forget about changing channels.  It is really really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks. Broadband feature is nice; but USB doesn't come cheap. Its like [...].  
A clock radio that you have to fumble for a remote to use....I don't think so.  I have the older models (CD  Clock Radio) and they are nice but the new model is irritating.  I also have the IPOD player and at least the volume controls are on the system.  I can't keep a system that I have to locate a remote to operate.
JUNE 04,2006I PURCHASED THIS RADIO FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES, HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO BE VERY WEEK. I AM A DOUBLE AMPUTEE AND AM CONFINED TO A WHEEL CHAIR. I DEPEND ON MY RADIO TO RAISE HELP. BUT, I AM AFRAID THIS ONE WILL NOT BE DEPENDABLE. I AM NOT ASKING FOR THEM TO BE RETURNED OR FOR A REFUND JUST LETTING YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS KNOW OF A VERY WEAK PRODUCT AND I COULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. COBRA WAS THE TOPS IN RADIOS BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO THE QUALITY.THANK YOU FOR LISTENING;WILLIAM HEMBREE WmHembree@aol.com
This carrying case worked well for me until I jumped in my car and the case caught on the door frame and the belt clip ripped right off of it, causing my iPod to fall to the pavement.  It turns out the clip isn't fastened on all that securely
for $20 bucks...After finally figuring out that I had to turn my mic inputs ALL the way up, I still can't get more than a -20db signal from my guitar...Save your money..
I bought one of these modules for my dell 700m. Installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or I get a blue screen. I contacted kingston and they said that this module hasn't been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only! I wouldn't recommend this memory for dell 700m users. 
I wish I had read the problems and netgear.com forums before purchasing this product.Huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily. This requires you unplug and plug back in the AP in order for it to stay visable to your computers.Second problem I am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare, and even at 3-5feet from the AP the unit is around 11-36mpbs.Do not buy this product, find another company who stands behind there products. All of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in India. People on the phone dont know how to help you and email support is a joke. Latest firmware fixes none of the problems
I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with. It has been nothing but a lemon since I got it. Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them. The graffiti is terrible and rarely works. I have to reset it all the time. Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems. I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them. I don't think they even looked at it. After my experience with this Palm, I will never buy Palm again
This thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over.  We thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery didn't help.  Don't buy this item.  I am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here
I have had various WiFi networking solutions in my home and office for several years.  While some Linksys units have worked for me, more often I have found them undependable.  In particular, the WPS54GU2 set up fine, but I almost always had to cycle the power to get it to work each time I printed.  Not worth the hassle
My drive FAIL after one year and a half...!!! This company really suck BIG TIME....I lost all of my data ...!!! ALL OFF IT...!!! THIS IS THE THIRD ONE THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR!!!  Total JUNK...!!! NEVER buy a LACIE AGAIN FOR SURE....MAXTOR EXTERNAL IS THE BEST!!
I bought this HD because my Lacie (which had lasted over 5 years) crashed on me finally. So I figured I would try a different company. Out of the box this  product looked great, although it was very large and heavy. I immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up - however that was the one and only time that it booted. I tried several more times and it wouldn't boot up. VERY VERY scary when you buy a new device to hold all you important data and it won't boot up out of the box. I don't know if this product just happened to be the one that sucked - but I am not taking any chance on a defective HD and my data. Going back to Lacie
I purchased this and shipped to US and finally had it delivered to India in gurgaon. Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a good microphone. I record my violin pieces on my laptop and used an ordinary computer mike for this. But I wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike. The gain was lower than the ordinary mike, it doesnt work at all without the battery, but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory. Unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres who'll entertain me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks down the drain. :..
DOES NOT WORK ON VISTA.  SOOOOO disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared with Vista upgrade (save for the Windows startup music).  I thought this new sound card would bring my sounds back.  Might have, but it says not compatible with Vista.  I guess I'll be getting a new computer.  :
are you serious?  I bought this a while ago to see if it was cool. It is a piece of junk, u can barely get any channels, and even if you do, you can barely see them and it has loud static.  dont buy it its garbage
The screen is too small. if you want to watch it in your car, you have to cover it because the back light is too week.
The item was not difficult to install but the adaptor plate did not fit my tv so I called peerless customer service and they had one sent to me but that cost me another 40 bucks. I was disappointed it was NOT as universal as advertised. once I got the tv up it is ok, and getting the tv up to it is a 3 person job and it takes two to lift it up as it should  for safety reasons but a 3rd person needs to hold the arm steady. I did find out there is another one that could have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks. I had to return the first tv to the store and round up help when I got a replacement. Now it looks like I may need to do that again as the replacement tv has problems also.This whole thing with the mount and tv has been very frustrating.Mike D. live and learn
These Verbatim discs are hands down the very WORST blank media I've EVER encountered! They're made by CMC Magnetics -- well known as the worst media manufacturer in the world. But not only are they CMC Magnetics, they're the worst of the worst of CMC Magnetics!The latest KProbe *hangs* when faced with these, forcing a hard reset. The latest Nero Burning ROM *hangs* when faced with these, forcing a hard reset. The program continues, non-stop, to display "waiting for media" when I use these, and an attempt to abort hangs Windows XP SP2 the same way it hangs Kprobe.Curiously, the media IDs on these are exactly the same as that on Philips LightScribe CD-R media (they're made by CMC Magnetics as well). However, at least the Philips are recognized by all my software and hardware, quite unlike the Verbatims. That's why I say that these Verbatim are the worst of the worst from CMC Magnetics. (The Philips are no prize, either, but they perform minimally well).The *ONLY* thing that worked with these media are the LightScribe labeling.  But what's the point of labeling discs you can't even RECOGNIZE, let alone burn?I had the exact same problems with these media in both my Lite-On LH-201AH burner and my NEC ND-2510A burner (the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for even low-quality media).Note that Verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by Taiyo Yuden. But, stupidly, they chose to go ultra-cheap and turned to the dreaded CMC Magnetics Corp. Thus, they lost all credibility!*AVOID THESE LIKE THE PLAGUE!*
YMMV, but my 80GB drive died after 6 months.  I found this be very handy to have around to transfer large files between work and home, but I expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of.  I'm glad I back up my data in more than one place
This product looks and feels very flimsy. Do not be fooled by the flashy, metallic-looking picture. The plastic shell of this device is the quality of McDonald's toys. One would think that for $300, the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting. The buttons are hard to press. In order to turn the device on, you have to press very firmly, which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell.The cable port for the DocuPen is also extremely flimsy, and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads  to take place; otherwise, the connection will be lost. I am a pre-medical student, and I very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product, believing that I could (for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk) scan my science textbooks in the library, including the colored diagrams, and in that way, I thought I would make back my investment, since textbooks go for at least $100 each. However, I now see that this belief was naive, to say the least. The Docupen is extremely difficult to use. The words come out distorted, like a jammed fax machine, and although the free Paper Port software which comes complimentary with the DocuPen is rather useful for annotating PDF's, the DocuPen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate.Furthermore, downloading is very slow (at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer), and since you can't see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer, you will have to re-scan about 80% of pages due to stretches, smudges, blurriness, suspicious blank spots, and general illegibility.I wish I had read some of the other negative Amazon reviews before buying this product. I would have saved myself a lot of money and time.If you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents, then this product may work okay for you, although a digital camera will probably deliver better results. If you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all-out "paperless" with this product, you will find yourself extremely disappointed. Until PlanOn decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi-decent shell manufacturuer, it will not a good buy. The idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential, especially when coupled with a Tablet PC. However, the execution of the idea needs improvement. I hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years, at a price that is comparable to quality.
This product is a sad joke.  It's expensive of course.  The paper is just heavyweight paper that's perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves... which takes some effort (not sure if it'd be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board).  But, whatever.  However, the software is crap.  That's the appropriate term.  Reading this I can save you an hour of your precious time.  No you can't make the template show right-side up.  That's right... to use the software you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS.  I'm not kidding!  I guess you could also turn your monitor on it's side.  You can rotate the text so it shows the way it should.  But when you edit it, it'll be sideways again.  So you'll have to turn your head (or monitor) back and forth sideways.  What kind of company would sell such a product? And oh yeah... if you're looking for templates for the DVD Inserts?  ... nada.  They're not there! 
FYI: This does not fit the new generation 5.5 of ipods (80 GB). Another thing is that there isn't a hole for the headphone jack which is rather odd
I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work
After about 3 weeks of operation, the fan clicks and buzzes like crazy.  Looking for a better option
I bought this product as a way to keep a large amount of backup data saved, however I have fought with the drivers for days now. Whenever the drive is working the usb on my computer does not work, if I try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes (even with the newest updates) I will be returning this product ASAP. I'm very disappointed and will not be buy netgear again! I only wish there was a 0 star revie
This was my second Netgear product I bought (previously a wireless modem which I was only okay with not impressed)  The idea of a network storage appeals to me.  But this drive just is not good.   In reading the previous reviews I found that it was a finicky thing, and be careful on the drives you buy for it.  Well I searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday.  Tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well, but that is where everything started to go down hill.  Midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages (which turn out to be things like this is untested on XP and might not work kind of errors) and suddenly my computer reboots.  Figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well, and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot.  Tried again, same thing happens.  Started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the SC101, you need to look in to your own computer.  To quote Netgears web site, "SCSI disk drivers from the Promise company conflict with the SC101 device drivers. Promise drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives. Many newer computers use Promise SATA drivers."My computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers.  Back in the box the SC101 goes, and I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me.  Tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests, and none work.  This is where I get really frustrated, Netgear support.  I waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone, who ultimately told me it was my own fault and I'd have to pay to have that "cr*p", yes he said it, from my system.  I needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill.  I have to pay to get this junk off my computer.  Way to support your products Netgear.  The tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand, and went through huge mood swings during the call, from happy, to argumentative, to depressed, to happy again.  I was freaked that this person knew my home address! All in all, this is a great concept.  After reading up on it and now experiencing it, I think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market.  Maybe by a company with better customer service.  It really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer
Range is very weak probably less than half a mile. Don't waste your money
everything works fine except for two flaws in Excel: on the numpad, the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key.  this is unacceptable, i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games.  logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products, but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings.  i will never buy logitech again
I live in San Francisco and have generally good radio reception.  This unit could not receive normal FM stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up... and I used the fancy "Dipole" antenna on the Boston Accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna.The HD part of the radio is total junk.  Sometimes the audio "skips" and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired (meaning 3 or 4 second drop-outs.)All in all, there's nothing good about this radio.  Don't buy it.
de K0UNX.  I know radios.I purchased the Recepter Radio HD a year ago, used it for a weekend and returned it immediately.  Even in the Denver market, with lots of very strong HD signals, this radio had trouble finding them.  I'd be listening to a strong station, and the radio would lose lock, go silent, and rebuffer before coming back to life.  This was one of the few HD radios available when I bought it.  I have since purchased a Sangean HDR-1 and love it.  Read my review under the Sangean HDR-1
Tried this with two different computers using Windows Vista.  Got this message: "One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it."  The mini-disk that came with it was no help.  No response from Tiger Direct.  Went to Radio Shack and got one.  It works
After one successful printing it didn't work at all. My printer is HP deskjet 712C. This cable seemed to be recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected
What more can I say than the above?  It is flimsy, doesn't stay in adjustment, rattles around when you move, and looks cheap to boot.  Don't waste your money, this thing is junk. It would be more appropriately priced at $5.00.
Tilting the foot rest back and forth is not the easiest thing in the world.  It's just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lot.  Mine broke in 2 different spots within a month..
There are many aspects of the T5 people want to count as negatives. For me I consider them annoyances but not killers. I would like to have WiFi with my PDA but I am not dead with out it. More memory is always good but the T5 isn't on the hurting side. It's not a good mp3 player with the memory it has. And even if you have a 2G card with mp3's it's not like this is what you would buy for MP3s. But as far as contact information, on the go applications etc.. I would consider this as good as any other. The problem as I have just found out is these are known to die. I haven't heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the T5 will at some point Die. It will lock up and even after all the resets listed from Palm it will not come back to even a factory state. You will have a Palm Powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top. There are a couple of fixes. If you are under warranty you can send it back to Palm for them to make it better. Or you can remove the battery and solder it back. This is a serious design issue that Palm is more than happy to charge you for.Until I ran into this I would have rated this a 4/5. Until this happened the device did what I expected it to do. I read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no WiFi. But it has one of the fastest processors (available at that time) in a PDA. Which was a different type of cool. The bluetoothworks well enough I haven't had any issues with it. You can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi isn't really that big of a deal.But if you can't trust your device is going to be working the next day it really doesn't matter what cool feature it has. This has been a very expensive let down.I don't want to buy another Palm after this experience but I am not sure what toswitch to...
First T5 lasted 6 months, then just refused to start - was replaced under warranty. This one locked up after about 3 months - was replaced again under warranty. The third T5 lasted about 5 months. It's now out of warranty and won't start or reset. No - I'm not rough on my PDAs. None of them got even as much as a scratch. Each one looked like new when it "broke". The first 2 times, Palm told me the ROM had failed. I guess it's the same problem again, but I'm not spending $169 to get it swapped for another faulty T5. Good bye Palm.Out of the box I think it's a good PDA, so check those 4 and 5 star reviews to see how long the users have had their PDAs before you buy
I bought this headset from retailer (offline), and returned it the next day. First off, I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sound. Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger (they use 40mm drivers), the sound quality of the headset was just fine.However, when it comes to wearing these headphones, the only words that come to mind are "uncomfortable as sin". The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears (and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation). Also, I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads, but it is nowhere near soft enough... in fact, I litterally couldn't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red (flush) from discomfort. Mind you, I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time, so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either... but these things, they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time, which isn't good at all. Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return. If your ears are tough, you should have no problem with this headset. The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you. However, if you're looking for comfort and good sound isolation, you'll want to look elsewhere..
I dont recommend these for 1st person shooter gamers.Impossible to tell if enemy is in front or behind you.Probably ok if direction of sound is not important to you.Left and right work ok but not front/rear for some reason.My hp laptop earbuds work better
The use of this AC power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless. On battery the radio works very well, just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost.Invest in batteries rather than this product.
I bought this card and the Belkin Pre-N wireless router in Nov. 2006 at a BestBuy store during Thanksgiving sale. The router worked but the card did not. I called Belkin many times. Everytime they asked me to re-install the drivers and software for the card but the card never worked. I wasted more than 4 hours on phone and re-installing drivers again and again. Then finally Belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacement. I pointed out that I should not have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but Belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs. I have shipped them the defective card today and am awaiting a replacement to arrive
I ordered this product June 21st and am now told i should receive it by Oct 28th.   I wouldn't waste my time ordering this product from Amazon
THIS SITE IS HARD TO FIND THE INK CARTRIDGE I NEED. #78 TRI COLOR FOR MY HP 750
Dear Sir/Madam: Its very difficult to email you regarding things I can't find.! Or you don't sell? I am looking for HP black ink. #20 for 656C printer. Now, you tell me which ink I need? No way you can tell.!! Because you are NOT selling or what? You site is very difficult to find Ink I need
Overall I don't like it. When the screen is black between scenes and what not, their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interference. Buy a different one, this one is just not up to the task
I ordered the A1500 and received the A1000. I opted not to send it back when I read the other feedback on this page. I didn't want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed (as the other fellow did below). Amazon is usually pretty good, not this time, and not on this product.If you want, you can call them at: 1.800.201.7575 (Toll free, US and Canada)1.206.346.2992 or 1.206.266.2992 (Outside US and Canada)1.877.586.3230 (Canada only)UK customer service: +44.208.636.9200
I ordered the Cobra HG A1500 High Gear CB Antenna. They keep sending the Cobra HG A1000. Now I'm stuck with a antenna I did not order nor do I want.
This Vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dad's new tracheostomy.  Problem is, it puts out TOO much mist even at the lowest setting!  We've tried everything including taping the hole, but it then goes from 'all' to 'nothing' because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through. Of course it wasn't until we started mentioning it to the various RN's that come to take care of my dad that 'everyone' using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem.  So... I've resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dad's mask.  Not a great way to do it (and just asking to be seeded by bacteria), but if anyone has a better suggestion, I'm all for it, even if it means suggesting a different humidifier..
O.K., so I'm paying $300 for a set-top box with a 40Gb hard drive, but I can't use it as a DVR? Why not? Also, the only content I can play on this set-top box is content that comes through iTunes? That's right. if it isn't in your iTunes library, you can play it on the Apple TV. This means you caqn play your DVD's, you cant't play saved DVD, iMovie, or other movie files, you can't play anything unless it has been successfully;y added to your iTunes library. Also, make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen TV. they aren't joking about this. If you don't have one, you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen (it won't go to the edges and be borderless) so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box. Any pros? It has to be the easiest setup I have ever experienced with an electronic item. I mean less than 5 minutes and I was set. also, I thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part, it was able to communicate perfectly with iTunes  just because I plugged the Apple TV into my Airport Extreme router that my computer was also plugged into. basically, Apple TV saw this is a direct link. I didn't think it would be that easy without having to configure something, but it was. Also the menus are very helpful and attractive. This will be a good product down the line when this will have a larger hard drive and DVR capability. Right now it's time to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better. if this had only cost me $100 or $150 I would probably keep it, however. $300 is too much for too little
The left palm pad keep peeling, possibly from the uneven heat.This make the protection pad a lot less useful than one wouldthink, which is most people buy this pack fo
Not very happy with this product.The software on the pc side doesn't work well at all.Won't list all my files and I can't get it to update changes or new folders.This bugger has way to big of a foot print.The remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies.Hey I have a Xbox with XBMC on it. Get a clue, and copy some of it's functionality. It continues to blow away any of the media players I have purchased
I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing.  The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.  I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself.  First off, I am only interested in playing videos from my computer, so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works.    I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections.  My house is fully wired with CAT5, therefore I am using this product wired, not wireless.  I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good.   The first thing I did was check for updates.  An update was found and updated successfully.  I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers.  It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed.  This unfortunately is the end of the good news.  It's all went downhill from here.  1.  Neither server, tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie.  They listed them as VOB_1, VOB2 etc.  So for example, I clicked on my Casablanca folder, I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie.  When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes, it did not go to VOB_2.   I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play.   arrrgghh!!  P.O.S. thing.  2.  As another review stated, the FF simply does not work properly.  Oh, sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward.  But there is no way to stop it.  If you press play while the movie is FF'wding, the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB.  more, arrrrgghh!This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device.  Which I will be doing first thing in the morning.My final advice to any prospective buyers:  S T A Y   A W A Y !!!!My final advic to D-Link, Great idea, but your product absolutely sucks.Oh one more thing,  Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly.  Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly, their English was terrible.  (Guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on, just one guess)  It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another.  I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients.  Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me.  She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over.  Sheesh,  I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right.One last interesting tidbit, on the packaging, they mention Nero recode CE.  So I went to the nero site to check it out.  Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed.  And you know what, D-Link is NOT one of them.  I will return this D-Link junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead.I bow my head in shame, As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway.
And I was right....I should have passed on this.  It was a pain to configure, and then none of the settings would stick.  Whenever I changed the default password, it would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a reset.  That kind of defeats the point.  Returning this item so I can get something decent.  The money saved is NOT worth it
bad customer service its been almost a month and i still have not received this product. ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything, neither did anyone answer the phones. i dont even know how to rate the item because i dont have it. im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help
You'll end up looking for something better.  Sound fidelity is pretty bad. 
There's a reason this thing is only 6 bucks.  It's absolute junk.  I put it into the cassette player in my car, and the sounds were completely distorted.  The voice constantly skips, and the casette sometimes clicks.  The quality of sound in my car is usually amazing, and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device.  I've tried both sides, but still no avail.  I plan on returning it if shipping doesn't cost more than the product itself
I have a DCS-900W camera that failed within a year. After that, I made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced. Obviously I was talking to some indian people overseas that don't seem to care about the "service" that much, and usually after a couple of transfers, the line got cut off or picked up by another layman. During conversation, the line quality is very bad.After a while, I just decided that $100 camera is not worth the time of the calls. I am in the process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau.Based on my experience, I would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from D-Link. Once you have any problem, they just won't honor the waranty
I was pretty disappointed with the Tune Belt because of two main reasons.  First, I had to take my Shuffle out of the protective rubber case that I usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the Tune Belt.  That wasn't such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve.  But then I went to wear it for a run, and the arm-band was too small for my arm!  I have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training, but nothing outrageous.  I would have thought that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users.  This is unfortunately not the case.  So if you have larger than average biceps (say 17" amd up), save your money...
i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness (100%). just scheduled an exchange LCD
After having installed the unit for 43 days, the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting.  This was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit "Flying"! Very dangerous!!Tomtom would not replace the unit, as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks! buyer beware.  See the TomTom forum for description and picture:[...]and other links to the base issue
I ordered this television with high hopes, knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that I would luck out and save a bundle.  But you get what you pay for.  Every Sharp Aquos LCD TV manufactured before April 1, 2006 shipped with bad firmware.  What does this mean to you?For me, it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the TV and turning it on, it turned itself off and never turned back on again.  Resets, system resets, power cycling, unplugging components didn't help.  My TV was completely bricked.  A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp TVs in the D4U and D6U series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase.  For them, the fix was a visit to a Sharp authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the TV.  I say a "visit" because Sharp does not cover in-house technician visits for TVs under 32", a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled.So here I am, 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no TV to show for it.  Instead, it sits at the authorized service center (because Sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either).I'm willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 4/1/2006.  Check the serial number on your TV if you do order one.  If it begins with a 501-512, 601, 602 or 603, immediately demand a firmware upgrade from Sharp (1-800-BE-SHARP), regardless of whether or not you're experiencing these issues; you will eventually, and hopefully while Sharp's warranty is still in effect for you.
i received my mp3 player with a big black spot in the middle of the screen, i sent it back and it has been 2-3 months  i havent heard anything back whether they will replace it or give me a credit
I have not been able to get this to work again. It was great for the first week, then it made my computer crash and now I cannot get it installed again. I am not sure I like that
I purchased this MP3 player thinking it was a good purchase.  Boy was I wrong.  Creative Labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware, software, or other products like this one.  Now having problems with the product is one thing, but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats [...].  Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned AFTER I purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month.  My MP3 player stopped working after 3 months, I did get it to work again.  Two months later the screen told me I had hardware problems.  OK, so I download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem, no go.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that I am working in Eastern Europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone.  Save yourself some frustration and get something better.  iriver maybe?  Just stay away from Creative Lab products. 
I bought this Mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the Ipod and I ended up paying dearly for it.  It is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months.  The firmware decided to stop recognizing songs, albums titles, and eventually that there was even any music to listen to.  Now I have a 200$ dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my PC.  Customer service? Don't count on it.  So if your into extensively troubleshooting, highly frustrating, pieces of junk, this is a great product. 
Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies - I have purchased seven, but now it is made with out the handle - so if that was part of the atraction of this case, note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' -- NOT!5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you don't need one
a virtual nightmare with set up. no help from their support staff on phones, nor online Q poorest choice i ever have made in a product!!I am a savvy computer type with network experience and this one for the books. Item still sitting where i left it......., useless
This product has a known defect for serial numbers R641 and less (see Logitech website). I just received my Amazon Order  and it was serial number R635. It will be sent back tomorrow. Hopefully, Amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own, rather than relying on its customer base
These are some of the worst ear buds I have heard since the very first ones came out. Voices are muted, highs are muddy, and lows are non-existant. The ONLY redeeming feature is since they are marketed as "surround sound" (yeah right...) they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headset and still hear my callers.
Maybe mine was broken, but I don't think so because I could see a red light at all the cable ends. I connected the splitter to my sound card, a TB Montego DDL, with a 1' cable and then tried both a 6' and 30' cable to my stereo. No signal whatever. Both the 6' and 30' cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card. I even used only the 6' and 30' cables in case the 1' was bad. Still no signal.I think you need to have either a very, very, strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one, or use a powered splitter.
Cheap and definitely nasty - they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear-cups, but after a few months light use, I lost sound through one cup then the other. In general - when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on. The batteries seemed to last pretty long though - actually the battery I had in there lasted longer than the unit itself. Very disappointing, but for the price, this is hardly unexpected
I was happy with the noise canceling features, not the best but definitely works.  Great for airplane rides - really helps cut out that background engine noise.  My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design - the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus (cheers to them).  the second set broke too in a different place - the deisgn of these just isn't very sturdy.  I'm gentle with my stuff too, so either I had bad luck w/two defective units or they're just not made well
It is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor.  Buying this handheld was a big mistake
I bought one for my son at Christmas and it broke after a month.  It just suddenly wouldn't turn on.  Amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days, before even getting the original back.  But the replacement model "froze up" after just 4 days and this time I am getting a refund.  To quote an e-mail from Amazon regarding this product "As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement."  So, DO NOT order one!
This would be a nice printer.  If only I could get it to print!  Not to mention when I turn it on it makes a god awful sound like some thing is jammed.  I've tried over and over to try to print something.  I've checked my options, turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing.  If your looking for a portible printer you have other options and I suggest using them
This is just a general review, of all DVD cases. I have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs. I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years, and anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks, so DVD's is your only source of video entertainment. My collection grew to more than 400. I have been trying to find a good case, that hold equal number of title books as it does DVD's. But that seems to be asking to much, or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers, you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly?????  Then when you look at the furniture options, everything seems to be made for function, and not style at all, they are generally pressboard P.O.S's and nothing I would want to keep in my garage.......... I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions, cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied!!!!!
This product will not fix your disc, I tried to fix a damaged CD and it only made the problem worse.  I ended up throwing away the CD and the SkipDoctor.  This is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work, I wish someone would have told me this before I spent money on it
I had a Pronto NEO for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after I dropped it 1.5 feet onto a hardwood floor.  The unit has a very cheap feel, especially for the price.  I wasn't at all surprised when it stopped working.  The PC software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap.  The touchscreen is very tedious to customize (I write software for a living, and I still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen).  I can't imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit, given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your PC to the remote.  The whole point of the Pronto NEO is that you can customize the touch screen.  Unless you are VERY comfortable with computer applications, do not buy this unit.  Aside from the touchscreen's fagility, is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small, given the size of the remote.  Did I mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months?  In short, this product is crap.  I might consider buying another one if it sold for $30 or less
Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client. It would be similar to, say, allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet. In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network. The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working. Added to my woes I can't tell you how often I saw 'the blue screen of death' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts.I am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution
Like other users have experienced, this unit is no longer functional after 18 months.  The wired base is still working but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights.  Poor product Netgear
I was given the iQue M3 for Christmas of 2005. A few months into the new year, I dropped it onto pavement, and it broke. For $99, Garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit, which I consider a fair price. Unfortunately, the refurb unit couldn't play directions at full volume, so I returned it for another refurb. This unit fell off the windshield still in it's cradle, and it started making that frying sound of short circuits. I called Garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit, they'd look at it under warranty. I had told the guy what happened, so I was pleasantly surprised; they did, in fact, replace it.Under all circumstances, the report you get back says the returned unit was "within specifications" (or words to that effect), even though clearly not. I have no idea why. Units will be returned with new software keys to enter, and the software will begin urging you to register, even though you already have.For some, the mapping software on the M3 will appear crippled. It is a basic drive from here to there unit. It does not allow you to load way-points, Points of Interest, and the like.Each of the units had quirks. On the first one, every time I inserted the SD card with maps, Windows player (or whatever it's called) would start up and ask me if I wanted to search the card for tunes. The second one had inaudible volume. The fourth one has a problem common to the first one: The brightness resets itself randomly to zero. Yep, zero. The first one left the powered brightness full on, so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on, but this one resets them both to zero. So you may think the unit is not turning on, but it's on. You just can't see anything on the screen. If you're outside, you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting, but if it's dark, you need a flashlight.The current one will do a hard reset if I start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when I put it in the cradle. This means I have to do the full new user routine. Touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone. After I've gone through the restart routine, the unit will then find the satellites and get me where I'm going, but I can't load destinations from contacts, as they're gone, so I have to type them all in by hand.If the battery runs out of juice, the unit is dead. It forgets everything, and I have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen. Press and hold to learn again how to copy. Press and hold to learn again how to paste. Reset the time from Olathe, Kansas, to where I live. All contacts, notes, calendars, and other information is lost. All preferences are gone.I complained about this to support at Garmin, and I was assured this is a Microsoft feature and that Garmin can do nothing about it. They recommended that I buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an SD card where it will not be lost. So now I carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data. I did learn, though, that if the battery runs down, the backup program is lost, so you can't retrieve your data from the backup SD card unless you have told the program to save as self-extracting archives. I learned it the hard way, of course.To restore, I pop out the detailed maps SD card, insert the backup card, navigate to the File Explorer, navigate to the SD card, open the contents of the SD card, select the latest back up, click through the restore procedure, click to OK that it has finished (just a minute or two with my small amount of data), click to restart, wait a long time for it to restart, tap to get past the owner data screen, enter the password, then pop the restore card out, reinstall the map card, wait while it reads it, then I'm good to go. I can't do it while I'm driving, of course, so if the unit resets on its own, I just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where "Home" is, which means I have to type it or other locations into the Where To dialogue.The unit defaults to 3D directions instead of north is always up, which is confusing for me as I can't look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where I am vis-a-vis the map. I'm sure this is my shortcoming, and I then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up, which I can't do while driving. It also defaults to different displays for day and night. The night display uses a dark background, and I have found that the menus for the Windows programs use a transparent background with black text. So I can't read the menu selections against the dark display. And the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if I lose power or the unit resets when I start the car or sometimes when I put it in the cradle.On the contacts database, the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. It also formats all numbers as US numbers. I have a few overseas numbers, and they are crammed into the (xxx) xxx-xxxx format, even though they are longer and don't start with an area code.In the calendar, if I have meetings scheduled outside my time zone, I enter them at the time they're scheduled. Then when I get there, I have the option of choosing the visited time zone, and all the times are screwed up, as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone. So I never use the visited time zone feature, and the unit assumes I'm still in my home zone wherever I may travel.I have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address, but for which I have the lat/long coordinates. I camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads - I quickly lose where I am and have to zoom out, which loses the road. On the whole, the directions part of the M3 is excellent. It gives good directions, has reasonably up to date maps, and lets you find stores, restaurants, gas stations, hotels, and the like in your area, and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations. On the whole, using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper. After a year of use, I can't put up with it anymore. I'll take Garmin's word that this is all a shortcoming of Windows Mobile and not Garmin's fault, but I can't put up with it anymore. I'll switch to Magellan or TomTom or some other unit that isn't Windows-based and that doesn't completely lose its mind when the battery runs down, doesn't randomly do a hard reset, doesn't randomly set the brightness to zero, and doesn't assume all phone numbers start with the area code to Olathe, Kansas. Maybe another manufacturer will let me import POIs and way-points from other people's files
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I have Directv with HD (5 LNB) and the signal was low. Signal was less than 60% for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching HD. So I bought these to amplify my satellite signal.  They actually attenuated the signal. The signal strength wasn't improved on the non HD receivers that I have as well. It didn't matter where I put them in relation to the dish and receiver.
The headphones sound great--no arguement there.  However, I was removing the plastic tips (which need to be changed every several months) and the headphones broke.  The company has only a one-year warranty so I was out-of-luck.  Again, I thought the sound was great, but for this price I would expect them to be more durable...I was hardly touching them when they broke off.Also, the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times
Just received radio yesterday, and am returning radio today! Pluses.... adequate LCD display and good illumination while on AC adapter. Good thumbwheel tuning in 1 Khz increments. Adequate speaker fidelity for small radio. However, the volume slew buttons have set "numbered" volume levels, and between settings of 5-6, there is a BIG noticeable increase in volume(not good), and while tuning shortwave bands, every approx 100Khz increment, there appears to be a "null" area, where signal meter reads a signal received, but quiet speaker. Also, on FM, if hands are near the radio, the signal breaks up(for weaker signals, not strong ones), and compared to my Grundig 400-PE, which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome, the Eton E-5 seems worse still!!! I am returning this today, and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead. Eton E-5, not bad, but certainly not worth 3 stars or above, especially, if comparing it to another similar size radio, and then comparing it to my Sony 2010. 
This item is an all around piece of garbage. After about 3 months of light use, it is stuck in 45 rpm mode. I sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode. Don't buy this piece of garbage, unless you like owning garbage, in which case this is right your alley, the Garbage Alley. I wouldn't even give this to a bum, because I would feel bad about it.

After buying this product, I opened the case after few days, as I was out of country, to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices. However every time I put it in the camera or other devices, it gives error and doesn't work. I couldn't use this memory stick since I bought it and as I opened the box almost 15 days after the receipt,I  am not sure how I can even return it back either. Basically not at all happy with the product at this time
The light makes my computer very sluggish, even when my laptop is not running off of the battery.  Browsing the internet, especially, is painfully slow, and I am on a high-speed cable connection
After owning a P-touch labeler for years,I found the need for a more duable label than my "M" tape was providing. I opted for this "TZ" tape labeler. Good price,looks good. What a mistake!!! The only thing well designed about this unit is it's abilty to waste more tape than it uses!! If you print a label of any size,count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it!!! At $20.00 a roll,prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button.Then go find the scissors and cut the excess off,so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk!!! But cheer up you can push six buttons,every time,to reduce the margin to "narrow". This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the label,and print two small dots on the other side,this will show you where to cut it with your scissors,to match the "narrow" side. Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY time!!Another "great feature,it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size,so you will only print large print.What a joke!!! What a hassle!! Now the good news. I used to make lots of labels,and now I only make labels for VERY important items. And only when I am up to getting mad for doing so. I really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars! You have been warned
We bought this phone two years ago.  While the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features (I've especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets), we've found it to be extremely unreliable.  The problems we've had are listed below:*very short battery life for the handsets*the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use*the handsets go "out of range" when one takes them only a modest distance from the base (even though we have the base in the middle of our house, the handsets don't work at the ends-- and our house is not that big)*the handsets randomly become "unregistered" from the base and have to be reset (this has only become a problem in the past month)The issues we've had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone-- usually we'd expect such a purchase to last longer than two years
I bought this phone for the great features and because I've had good luck with other Motorola products. The phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have. The handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit. The only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings. Range on the handsets is only mediocre, I can't talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located. Also, battery life is very limited. Overall the phones are very disappointing and I would definitely recommend not buying them.
Purchased MD761 and 4 ea MD71 for throughout house because Patricia (wife) in wheelchair and on oxygen 24/7. She could beep all phones in emergency and I would hear. First- sound terrible, second- after 1 month most phones good for less than 10 minutes usage and constantly dropping calls, third- phones quite often in 'searching' mode when picked up for use. Entered house to find wife unconcious and not breathing. Started CPR and reached for phone to call 911. Phone in base beside her wasSEARCHING!!!!!!! Stopped CPR and ran to another room for different brand phone and called 911. Resumed CPR. Patricia DIED in spite of my and 911 personnel's efforts. Looking for someone I hate to give these 5 phones, my last Motorola product
It didn't match the Acoustic Wave player I bought. There should have been also two outdoor speakers, as a promotion for buying both pieces.The page, from which I ordered both pieces, was unclear, and I received the CD player with the wrong CD Changer. I had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player. (I know I'll be refunded the price of the first changer). But by then, the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished. I received the real changer a few days later, but lost the speakers. I think Amazon owes me the speakers, which is what the bad page made me miss
In general I've been happy with Belkin accessories, but this cable is the pits. It lasted less than a month! I used it to connect my HD/DVR cable box to my receiver. No crimps, kinks, or undue stress on it, but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent.I don't like to support the Monster Cable hype, but because of their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one. So far no problems
Bought 4 ! They don't work. The batteries do not last. We are trying to return them
After using these radios two months I can say that battery life is poor.A full charge doesn't hold three hours.Perhaps my batteries didn't come in good condition. I didn't use them on AAA yet... 10 mile range is not true in a normal environment, open sea or desert perhaps.Product works fine while battery las
After receiving this DRUM which was listed as having a 25,000 yield capacity, on 12/11/06....Today 1/15/07 my printer is giving me the same error message "DRUM NEAR END"   There was no indication when I purchased this product that it would be refurbished..I certainly have NOT printed 25,000 copies...
The transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do
I knew better, but I did it anyway, thinking that it would be a good compromise (we have IBM, Dell, and Toshiba laptops and a Sony Really Nice Monitor).  No modem port (not a surprise, but would have been nice), the video display is, well, you can see stuff on the monitor.  One of the USB ports isn't reliable.  I could go on, but you get the picture.  Don't bother
Every other negative review here is accurate.  The video connection is horrible.  The mouse runs on a delay of 1-2 seconds and is unacceptable.  Try the competing Kensington product instead.  It's more expensive, but it works.  I switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly - in short, as advertised and expected
I tried 3 of these DVD+Rs, none of them worked, errors in every burn. I used another brand to burn the session and it worked perfectly, so it is definately a problem with these DVD+Rs and not with my burner
i've come to expect a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse. the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface, and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser won't track right. i had to open the thing up and shave down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didn't test it well enough. unless your willing to do that skip this one, it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice. i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul. but then again you do get what you pay for :
Bought it for my Nokia N80 and it doesn't work...typical! Shouldn't have bought a generic memory!! Serves me right! Anyway..
I purchased this product and couldn't get it to work on a PC, laptop, or pda (cingular 8125). Not only does it not register in any SD/MiniSD card reader, but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well. I am currently pursuing a refund
I bought this Adapter because I could use the cable that came with iPOD, (one fewer thing to carry).  Well, about six months after opening this item, I noticed that my iPOD was running on battery.  One of the contacts had broken, and the device was not working anymore.  I am disappointed, but should have expected that for the $10 I spent. 
The principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews. I was never able to get the card to do anything. I tried removing and reinstalling the drivers. I tried getting assistance through the web site. I tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call. I've decided to cut my losses and buy a different card
Wristpad seemed to comeunglued far to soon to be considered normal wear, and mousing surface was dificult to clean it hold onto the dirt with its textured surface.I just couldnt suggest anyone else spent $15 on a mousepad that isnt going to last them
I put this cover on immediately after I opened my iPod after reading how easy they are to scratch.  I've never had my iPod without the cover on it and have had it 3 weeks.  I now have an iPod covered with distracting scratches on the screen.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  THIS CASE IS JUNK
Have a second Generation ipod?  If so, this is not the product for you.  After buying my new green ipod I needed something to protect it, so I bought the "Speck Nano SkinTight Delux with Holster."  It just didn't fit it.  I tried, but the only way to fix it was to cut part of it off:  don't do this.  I sugest making sure the product detail includes the "second generation.
Do not order this item, if you want a DVD player with a 5 inch screen.  This item is not as pictured.  You will receive a small orange colored player with a 3.5 inch screen
We had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam. We would get an error message, and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while. We finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program, after I had to ask to speak to a supervisor. (The tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them) We have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again. The ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount, and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam. Tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth, and for now the unit is working. We still haven't addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem. I hope HP reviews comments on this website occasionally. I would like them to know I have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years, but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position. Also, HP tech support is very difficult to deal with at best. I talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible English. I am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a product that is well supported. HP are you listening
Easy setup, but who cares, when the end result is a very slow video.  Sort of reminded me of Jim Carey in the movie "The Mask". When he whips his head from side to side and you see the "blur", THAT'S what you see with this webcam! Don't waste your money. I'm sending it back tomorrow!
This sucker couldn't pick up a single channel; not even one less than 10 miles away.  I live in a fairly open area
The case looks great and fits well, but it's nearly impossible to remove.  I had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time.  I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod.  In addition, it's too wide in the case to dock in my Logitech speaker system.  I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the case off for docking
Although the RS receiver doesn't have TV reception (who cares),it is 1/2 the price, PLL digital, 3" speaker, DX/LOC switch, andprobably much better quality..
Bought it for my wife - the pink just didn't match anything in my wardrobe...She uses her player for the gym, and treats it somewhat rough.  This "case" doesn't protect the screen from scratches (see most other reviews), but it hasn't fallen off while she's worn it, either.  About 1/2 useful, really.On the other hand....it was cheap, right?  Right?
The only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection. It is nice that it has a clip, and it fits the mp3 player snugly, but... Would be nice if it has a clear "window" to protect the screen
According to SysInternal's Process Explorer, both HWI (hardware interrupts) and DPC (deferred procedure calls) tend to run to 3%-40% each while this card is installed; both drop to under 1% once it's removed. Both remain under 1% while using another manufacturer's (USB-based) 802.11/b WiFi adapter. I'm given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers, but I've found no useful driver update info on D-Link's web site, last I looked. That other /b adapter, BTW, gives better throughput than this /b/g card of D-Link's
Does not consistently work! I have a toshiba a15 (Win XP Pro) and sometimes this works, but usually it doesn't. Lately, it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer. It used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found, which forced me to reload the driver. But lately it's just been giving me a blue screen. I have used PCMCIA cards before and never once had any issues.D-Link needs to support their faulty product with a new driver! Bad customer service!I WILL NEVER BUY A D-LINK PRODUCT AGAIN!!
I bought this mouse while on the road when I forgot my Microsoft wireless mouse. I do not have the original packaging otherwise I would have taken in back. The USB receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the back, I often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card. After a week of use the mouse started to wig-out. Erratic movement etc. If the mouse is left unattended for any length of time I cannot seem to wake it up with any of the buttons. The ONLY thing that works is using the wheel to scroll. The really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until I unplug the receiver. I thought this was because I was using a Mac, I experienced the same behavior on my PC as well. I'm going to throw this away since I would not wish it on my enemy
This item was not practical. It looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional
Overall this item works as expected, but requires to be reset (i.e. cycle the power) once every 24-48 hours.I will be replacing it with another model
The ends are comming off this cable doesn't meet the normal Belkin standards
We got the hdmi cables, but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the website.  The cables come without any packaging, and there is no indication anywhere that they are the same brand name items advertised on the website.We have not yet used the cables yet, and we're not sure whether they will work or not
Ever since I loaded the Targus drivers on my Tungsten C, the battery discharges quickly and won't take a full charge.I've removed the driver, with no change.  The next step was to do a hard reset of the Tungsten C and I'm hoping it will take charge.I'm taking this keyboard back for a full refund
It worked OK for 2 months, but the KB kept on falling off. When I complained, I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37. Yet, it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002. The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working. I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC. I do not believe that this should be permitted. If you sell something, stand behind it. Very disappointing
Works fine on Windows XP, but does not work well with Linux.  I've been using Linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time, and still had issues getting this card to run under Linux.  My built in 10/100 NIC was much faster than this card would go.  Ended up getting an Intel gigabit card that, of course, works with no issues.  Save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a Linux box. 
I just bought these to compare to my pair of V20s, and they just suck in comparison.The Bass is non existent in comparison, and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny. Any sort of Equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion. I'm usually a fan of Altec Lansing products, but...These look nice and are compact, but the sound is not good, at all. The fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appalling...
I did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computer.  Since most new computers use USB for serial interface, the usefulness of this unit is limited.  My two newly purchased HP computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product.I would not have bought it had I known this.  I have not used the GPS since I bought it.  It will probably be tossed out.The serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package.  So you don't see it prior to opening the package.  Once the package is opened it is a mess that probably cannot be returned.Lastly, this is one of the worst packaging jobs I have seen.  The plastic clamshell is so hard to open that I think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors.  The cut plastic is also dangerous
I have this radio and it's a POS. Remote isn't very responsive and the display is WAAaay too bright (will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person) and the user interface is terrible. The thing gets lousy reception and in general, there is a reason why this is always the lower priced iPod type radio on websites. They are trying to get rid of it because it s_cks!!!!!!
I bought this alarm clock today (April 7, 2007) at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $10.  I wish I had seen the reviews first.  I bought it because of the product name, small size and variety of options.  Unfortunately, I realized it wasn't a great buy when I brought it home...and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the clock would stay on.  The connections appear to be very sensitive and the battery doesn't stay in place.   The clock light is pointless.  It's supposed to help you see the time in the dark, but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry.  Actually, the screen is blurry in most positions  even with the light off.   As for the alarm, it's pretty quiet.  If you're a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment, this is not the clock for you.  You'll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear.  A final note on this product: The clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems...but only with the battery cover slightly open.  If I close the cover all the way, the clock shuts off.  If you want an alarm clock that will last awhile, I suggest buying something else.  You get less than you pay for with this model.
I wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer. Even though instructions from the manual was followed, the printer did not work. The customer support is claimed to be 24/7, but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet. This product cost more than a linksys router. So customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time
I had a 1GB Titanium Sandisk Cruzer at work fail.  I tried several times to contact Sandisk, including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response.My wife's Cruzer just failed as well (the power light comes on, it is recognized by XP, and the light goes out, the system can't ID the device, so it's useless.  It does the same thing on all of the XP systems in our house).  I've tried front side USB connections, rear connections and hub connections.  No dice.  I'll never buy another Sandisk Cruzer.  And I was going to order another 100 for the office.  Their loss
SURE THESE FLOPPY'S ARE INEXPENSIVE...THEY ARRIVED ON TIME...THANKS AMAZON!!!!!  BUT THE PHOTO DOESN'T GIVE IT ANY CREDIT...THESE DON'T COME WITH A PLASTIC CARRYING CASE LIKE THE PHOTO...JUST A CRAPPY CARDBOARD BOX! COME ON GUYS....WHERES THE PLASTIC CASE FOR THESE THINGS, NOW THEY WILL BE FLOPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE IN MY DESK DRAWERS ETC
I ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices (all had the same description and specs).  It worked for about 2 weeks, and then quit.  A friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette, which had come loose. Since then it has come loose twice more, so I just don't use it anymore.  When it worked, it worked fine, but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution
I just purchased this item -  now I'm planning to return it tomorrow.  One of the advertised features, the ability to store liner notes just doesn't work properly.  They just don't into the pocket without bending and/or forcing them in.  To me, the liner notes have value and I'm not willing to fold, spindle, or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet
As soon as I received this radio I tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up. The base felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radio. I am looking to return this item as it is not designed right. I cannot comment on the reception as the antenna is broken!Overall, it's a nice looking unit but they cheaped out on the materials.
Machine started making loud grinding noises when started or while printing. Showed it to a repair shop, says the fuser is a toast. Replacement cost part and labor $300. Died just after one year so have to bear the expense. Poor design/quality. Beware, i searched the web and looks like i am not the only one with this problem
our MFC - 8840DN worked fine until a paper jam inside the machine caused damage that couldn't be fixed by the sales technician.  Lots of waiting for a response from Brother at their call in website.  They waited out the warrenty.  Will never buy from Brother or Amazon again as a result of this
The buttons don't have that clicky button feel, so you press and you're like "did it go?"... The labels are hard to read, icons take a little figuring out. Honestly I use it for turning on/off, and if I want to do anything else I go up to the iHome to adjust it.
My first and main complaint about this product is that it does NOT fit the 60gb iPod Video.  The 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb, and this case won't close around the 60gb iPod.  A secondary complaint is that, though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb iPod from shocks, there is no protection for the screen.  It's just a hole in the case (like the hole for using the wheel), and I just require more protection for my video iPod.  A third (minor) complaint is that there's a non-removable knob on the back of the case, for attaching the belt clip, and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket.  I'm returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen, too
I live in Washington DC, so I generally get a signal when outdoors.  Using these headphones did not yield an increased signal for me
Bought these to use with the XM Myfi. They are not comfortable to use. They put pressure on your ears. Now the good news, they do get decent reception, I tried them in my office in NYC which has a northern exposure and it got good reception
I, too, experienced the "Blue Screen of Death" on my laptop which has XP pro on it.  I had to uninstall the card software in order to stop my system from continuously rebooting.  On another note, the install of the router was GREAT, regardless.  I didn't get anywhere with the Tech support group and had to return everything.Anthon
This picturemate has been a total disaster.  After printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow.  Put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again. Not only does it not print many photos with a true color image, but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT
This printer has been a piece of garbage since the day I bought it. I don't know why I kept trying, as the purchase was made about a year ago. It should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and I would have cut my losses (instead I did buy one more package of paper and ink. Mistake.) I have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message, turning the printer off, turning it back on, doing that several times, and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day. Now it says the cartridge should be replaced, when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge (and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures, which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge. I have printed about 6.) The ironic thing is, the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful. The one that I printed today was perfect. But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours. This is the last time I try to use the printer, it is finally going in the trash
I purchased one (from a local store not Amazon.com), brought it home and printed a photograph that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer (my mother-in-law's).  The resulting photograp was horrible, it had a very green tint to it.  I then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer, the green tint remained.  I checked the troubleshooting section of the manual, checked/cleaned the print heads, and still the problem remained.  Given that the product is still on the market, I suspect I had a broken unit.I did not like the LCD, it is very hard to read.  I adjusted the contrast but it did not help.  [...]
I have only had the batteries for a short time, but they are working great. I have recharged all three sets "4 per set" three times each. (that's what taks to run my Canon PowerShotS2/I2 camera)all good news.I take a lot of pictures and I need 3 sets to keep me going for about 6 hours.But I know that I need another 3 sets to really keep me in the field for the day. I do alot of back packing and long walks on the beaches.These batteries are really good they have never let me down as of yet, that's why I will be getting more. All I can really say is byem
it says it's an A/V dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv. i'm really pissed about this product.what a waste! A/V cables that sell for 20$ are incredible. they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the a/v inputs of my tv
I was very disappointed when I received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables.  Cables that you can pick up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper.  Just ridiculous.  The Airport Express itself is fantastic, but skip this accessory and go to your local Radio Shack for the mini-RCA cable, and a quick search online for the optical to mini
I dont like this mouse, i brought, and never work, its useles
Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product I've ever used.  It has nearly ruined my 2001fp.  I was stupid and used it on my primary display first, instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that's far superior to klear screen products.  My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out.   My 3 year old laptop's display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 50/50 solution on it, my 2001fp looks horrible now. 
This remote controller was quite a dissapointment.  I am using two other Philips/Magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better.  This one does not look like the picture (which looks more like the 425 model).  It does not cover the equipment I have (while the 425 model does), It's learning mode is flaky and unreliable, to say the least. The range is shorter then that of the 425S.  Conclusion:  This would make for a nice ornament (It does look nice, and, if you are lucky you may be able to control  some devices.
I bought this product to replace a previous HP all-in-one printer I had.  This is by far the worst printer I have ever owned.  It does not like photo paper, it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced.  Do yourself a favor - DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
merchandise returned to vendor by shipper as damaged in shipment. Cancelled order!!
The only good thing I can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works.  But...software installation is long and tedious (and took three times on one laptop to get to work). Installed drivers cause my PC to take 45+ seconds longer to boot and sometimes (about 30%) stop the shut-down sequence (I have to click "end" in a dialogue box).  The ink runs out (even the big black one) amazingly quickly and replacements are $54 at Costco.  It seems you gotta get ONLY HP cartridges, as third-party cartridges fail.  I'll never buy another HP printer
This unit replaced my old AIO 7410, which I LOVED. This one just feels cheap. The construction is cheap, parts are loose, and it feels like a child's toy, not an office tool. Given the choice, I would not buy another one
I dont like this mouse, i brought, and never work, its useles
They listed the 49X and they shipped the 49A(standard capacity), so like everyone else who bought this product, it is really the standard capacity toner that you are going to get. You may get it at a lower cost elsewhere check around....
Looks and feels nice.  But when dropped on concrete or ceramic floors ir will snap.  Both broke the same way within a few weeks.  I'm looking for the original all-plastic stylus
The leather case works great.  Easy access to buttons, space for business cards and SD cards.  Ah!... the smell...leather.  Five stars
The Uno's MIDI input did not work with my Roland A-37 MIDI controller keyboard, even after downloading the latest drivers.  Using Cakewalk (Home Studio 4 running on a Compaq V2000 laptop) to record and view the individual MIDI events, I could see that some of the note-off messages had been improperly decoded by the Uno as note C-zero.  This caused those notes to ring indefinitely and caused an ultra-low note to sound... very unpleasant and obviously unusable.The MIDI output did work fine driving my Roland Fantom XR and Roland JV-1010 with no problems.After reading another Uno  A-37 user's identical problem (on Amazon), I returned the Uno and purchased an Edirol(Roland) UA-25 audio/MIDI interface.  It works perfectly with all of my equipment including the A-37
The shape conforms perfectly to the designer's hands, but unless you share the same DNA, I'd avoid this product. I've used many of these over the years and this is the only one I struggled with. Constantly shifting it to get it's high and low points in a place that was tolerable. I finally reversed it, pointing it towards me and it worked a little better. This just needs to be a simple pad. Instead, they've overdesigned it as a gimmick.
I don't even use it anymore, didn't think it was that great.  I got a gel rest from fellows, a lot better...
I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February.  I am returning it and this is why:The package arrived from Amazon.  I loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord.  I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state.   Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player.  So after the music was loaded, I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music.  The sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc...  The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player.  I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there.  So I plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer.  The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player.  I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there.  Then I accessed through the computer just fine.  All my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd's.  The player just wouldn't read about half my songs.  There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize.  I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks.  This happened with my entire music collection.  So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update.  It did not solve the problem.  I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine.  I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service.  It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why.  They have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company I have ever spoke with.  After three calls, never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, I arrived nowhere.  They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem.  No email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place.  So I tried a fourth call.  This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand, saying "I can't believe you Americans" and then mumbled something in another language.   I asked for a supervisor. He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days.  Then he hung up.  I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature.  They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way.  So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again. By the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed.  Also, when doing research on this product, I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files.  This is not true.  This player will not play any files without being converted first.  I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file.  The format they use is absolutely a waste of space.  If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format, it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more.  I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie.  I was wrong, the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted.I would not recommend this product to anyone.  As much as I don't like the IPod, I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because:  1. It plays all my music 2.  They have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers.I hope this helps anyone looking at this player.Jeff
I am on my 2nd unit and both lockup after a short time. Neither the remote nor the front buttons will work when it locks up. You have to unplug it and leave it unplugged for at least 5 minutes - maybe longer.  It works good when it is working
Would of been great to receive so I could of gotten some use of i
I agree with the other review, Sony brand VHS tapes have begun a steady decline in quality over the past years.  As a almost life long user of SONY premium grade tapes, I have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality I get when I record, even off my dish.  The picture is never up to snuff with what I see when I watch the show as it is being recorded.  For the past two years, I have been able to notice the differences when I am watching something on a SONY tape, the flaws have become to big to ignore. I will be buying TDK from now on, and I suggest you do the same.  SONY used to make a great VHS tape, but I guess they are concentrating now on making more Playstations
This memory did not work. Still have yet to receive refund from seller
We ordered this case/auto mount for our Philips PET710 7" Widescreen Portable DVD Player because it was the one recommended by Amazon.  I needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler.  I eventually got this thing to work (failure was not an option if you get my drift), but it has a number of drawbacks.-In order to mount it, you have to remove the top half(huh?).  Having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose.  I accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when I drove away.-It's too small.  The Philips portable DVD player is too long for the case and the headphones and car/ac converters also pull the player out of the case.  Plus (and this is really amazing), it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the DVD player.  I have to carry the headphones and sleaved DVDs seperately!I chose my last DVD player b/c it came with an auto mount case, and even though I like the Philips DVD player, I'd do that again if I had it to do over.  Having the right case/mount for your DVD player is that key
What were they thinking? Or Are they thinking at all? Sonic Stage is a piece of crap. It freezes, hangs and very very user friendly???? Since you need their software to load the music, I would stay away from this player as far away as possible. Pros: Nice sound quality. Cons: Everything else. My recommendation is go for Creative USB players. It's very good quality and better battary life. With Creative players, you just drag and drop files and you done with it.I see why Sony is failing in MP3 players market
The software to this MP3 player made it too much work. Anything that freezes up my computer has to go. Here's my experience.I purchased this player on February 23rd and returned it to the store on March 8th. I was somewhat apprehensive from the beginning about the software but decided to give it a try. I installed the software with no problem, but found the media player to be cumbersome compared to other media players. I just didn't like the look of it or how it categorized the music files. I did download some music and other audio files and the player worked just fine. It had a very nice sound, easy to use and wonderful to carry around. I listened to it quite a bit and the battery stayed almost at a full charge.Fast Foward Week 2I wanted to delete some files and add some new ones. I opened up the media player and did the exact same thing as I did at first. First, the program began running really slow and then froze. I ctr/alt delete and started over. It worked for a second and then froze again. I rebooted and it did the same thing. I came back to it the next day and it did it again. I uninstalled it (so I thought), and it continued to freeze. It doesn't completely uninstall off of your computer. I know this because I didn't have to "re-authorize" my computer to use it again. I had to manually go in and find it and remove it from my computer. There are lots of hidden files.In conclusion, had it not been for my experience with the software I would have kept the player. 
I have used this type of inexpensive wireless mic before and the others I tried had much better sensitivity. You have to touch this mic with your lips to be herd. There are better choices even in this price range

Got the phone and found out that in order to mount it to the wall, I need to purchase a $4.00 part and pay $5.00 shipping and taxes.Now all the specs say wall mountable, not wall mountable with an extra purchase!Ok, $8-10 isn't going to break me, but somewhere it should state that you need to get an extra bracket in order to mount it on the wall!So, since I can't mount it on the wall, I haven't used it yet! Have to wait a week or so for the wall mount bracket to come in...
Easy to set up and worked great for 2 months then it just stopped working.  Horrible customer service!  Will never buy from this company again!
Ok, so this is probably not the best protection for your iPod, but what do you want for 6 bucks? I'm cheap. If you're not, buy something more expensive perhaps...Pros:- It does protect the screen and click wheel nicely.- The flip-up top magnetically shuts and holds securely, which I guess helps if you happen to drop it.Cons:- The belt clip is ridiculous. It's not a stationary clip. Instead it spins around, which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater. This product is not for the joggers.- The leather strap that comes with it is too short, which makes it difficult to operate the iPod when it's around your neck.- It seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under Pros above. But, as long as you never take your iPod out of the case, no worries.- This is made for the 30 GB iPod Video, but it's actually a little big for it. It leaves room for the iPod to slide up and down in the case. It makes accessing the HOLD switch difficult sometimes when the flip-up top is down. It's easier to just open the top.If you don't care about the cons and you are cheap like me, go ahead and buy it
The unit requires registration and an authorization number from the manufacture before maps can be loaded into the compact flash card. This requires determining the CF card ID when registering. Instructions for this procedure are very poor and navigating Magellan's web site is tricky at best. If you enter the CF ID incorrectly, you cannot store any maps in the unit even if you are provided an authorization code for the CF card. Beware
I went online to Amazaon, a site I trusted, to locate an HD RADIO for my desk at work.This was listed as an HD radio; only after I received it, opened it, and plugged it in did I discover it is NOT an HD radio.  Both the 3rd party vendor and Amazon claim I have no right to a refund.  The FCC calls this fraud, and my case is added to a couple of hundred across that nation
5 ml for $20. I would refuse to buy any printer that used this cartridge on principal. Die in a Fire, HP
I liked the MD671 for the home office so I thought the MD7161 would be a good upgrade for the home phone. Not so. The handsets intermittently cut out when the person on the other end is speaking. I tried all the troubleshooting recommendations with no change in the problem. If you cannot hear the entire conversation that sort of makes the phone unusable, right
This thing is a piece of junk.It stops working in between of a song for no reason.u can get a better mp3 player if you are spending this much
Rarely do I write a review but this product is so bad I had to.  Expecting Sony electronics to perform well, what a disappointment, this one is a bummer.  Save your money.  There has got to a better under cabinet radio out there.  While the concept is good and the design sleek; don't be fooled by the packaging.  Nothing works well.  FM reception is poor, sound is terrible, controls are not intuitive.  To top it all off a year after purchase (yep, the warrantee just expired) the CD player decided to only play the first track of any CD inserted.  Forget listening to the rest of it.  This product is really ZERO stars.  I've tossed the whole works in the garbage
It's too small and signal is too weak. The life of battery is too short.Not recomment to buy this. You can find some other model better quality
Check 10 cases, at least 6 are broken in new box. I don't want to waist my time to check the remain 15 pieces. 
Hard to believe this product is still being sold when it's not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods.  Also the claims of good design I feel are overstated.  Finally the speakers are weak and sound like it won't be long until they're shaking, this may influence what music you'll end up playing through the system.All said, though, I'd be happy with it for the price if only they'd update it to fully handle my ipod
My printing problems began two months after warranty expiration. I tried every troubleshoot I could find, three times. What a beautiful machine. It does everything very well. It even looks great sitting there on the desk. But what if it stops printing, then what good is it? I finally gave up and bought something else
I ordered this for Christmas from a Marketplace Seller. It was defective and assumed I would have to deal directly with Philips to get a replacement. After seven weeks, I still do not have a replacement from them; their customer service people keep telling me 10-15 days, and I have no recourse. I also thought the unit was complicated to use and would gladly obtain a refund if I could, or even get the unit. I would not recommend buying this or any other Philips product to anyone. Their customer service is the worst I've ever dealt with. I also had to pay the shipping to return their defective DVD player
I had read several reviews here before purchasing this product, but went ahead and bought it anyway, thinking that Logitech might have fixed their quality problems since those reviews were posted.  I was wrong.After a few weeks of satisfactory use (long enough to get past Amazon's reasonable window for returns), the space bar started working intermittently.  Incredibly annoying, and it renders the device unusable for all practical purposes.Even before the space bar turned against me I was unimpressed with the feel of the keys (I use a Dell wireless keyboard, an Apple wireless keyboard and the keyboard on my IBM X-series laptop).Bottom line - the thing looks great on a desk, and it is nicely compact, but it probably won't do what you need it to.  Look elsewhere
This thing was a nightmare for us. So much in fact that we returned it. It never played the movies correctly and even scratched every movie we played in it. Do not waste your money on this thing
This phone has about a 20 foot range before it starts cutting out.  It has great features but you can't really move all about your home
My friend has this cord to connect his iPod to his stereo, and it works great, great sound, good ease of use etc. I wanted one so I went to Bestbuy today and got one by RCA that sounds just as good for $7.99
You don't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals. Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them. Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel? There's no gold inside! So there's no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables. If you don't believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie. Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference.With analog signals, a good quality cable may make a difference (although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope).
The Epson R2400 is a purely Photo Printer. Be sure to understand this before you buy. So if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it  . . . think again. The K3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted. It took three calls to Epson and replacing the ICC profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the K3 ink compatibility with the plain paper. All the magazines raved about the Black and White printing quality. NOT. At least not on Premium Quality Photo Paper. Perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers. I saw very little improvement over my Epson R320. Now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer. The biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as Staples. The in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore. This is Hint #1. Hint #2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for Monday you are SOL. The only option you have is to order the ink online. Trust Amazon as they can find and deliver. However if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges. Cartridges certainly dont last very long and at $12-$15 each with eight of them your burning $100-$125 a set. Bulk ink tanks are coming out but I doubt the K3 Inks will be imitated. IF you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you. However at $850 I fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper. I haven't been happy with this printer and I plan to replace it soon. Amazon's being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here.
At the beginning, I really thought this is a very nice product. It does solve the CD organize and automatic storage problem for many people. However, this equipment is poorly engineered. I bought four units and all of them failed within a year for various reasons. There is no easy way to even take the discs out of the faulty units. If you ever think about move this equipment to another room, it is almost bound to fail. Customer service usually take 2 days to respond. The phone service guys do not answer questions about disc stakka because they know this is a bad product and rather not to deal with it with the disappointed customer. Imagining someone charges your $400 to organize 300+ CDs for a year and then quit. I am completely pissed off.
I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman
This home theater package, despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality, is ultimately very disappointing.I'm new to HDTV and HDMI so I didn't know as much as I needed in order to make a fully informed decision.  I have a Sony Bravia XBR3, Oppo upconverting DVD player, Scientific Atlanta HD box and Nintendo Wii game console.This unit only offers pass-through video, so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the TV for each type of input (HDMI, component, etc.).  For the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection, you'll pay in extra cabling costs.The HDMI on this unit carries video only - no sound - so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your DVD or cable to the receiver, and then from the receiver to your TV.  Again, major inconvenience and lots of additional connections.The manual for this unit is beyond terrible.  I'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like Sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one.  For example, there was a hum when watching TV that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not - some are shielded and some aren't.  Nothing in the manual about this.  There are probably just enough HDMI and component connections for the basic user like myself.Plus side is that there is no DVD player with this, so I can use my own.Given a chance to do this again, I would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output
Man, were we diappointed with this GE phone! We did everything right---"trained" the battery in the beginning, made sure we routinely charged it, never dropped or abused this phone, and then one day it started not holding a charge. We couldn't figure it out.It worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out, just like the other reviewers have said. We had a 10-year old Toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it's unfortunate demise, which is when we acquired this loser. Are there any good phones out there somewhere???
Nice basic phone. I've used it happily for two years, until the battery died. What's the deal with the batteries on new cordless phones? My 5.8Ghz Toshiba wonder died after less than 2 years, while my trusty AT from mid-90s keeps on ticking
This is an excellent item for anyone on-the-go who has an iPOD Nano. No longer do you need to carry those cumbersome CD's around or get distracted while driving when a CD ends and you need a new one. Why pay the big bucks for a CD changer  player when all you need is this  an iPod Nano
The price and some positive reviews led me to purchase this item, but after only about 1,000 pictures, all I got was corrupted data.  I had the card professionally tested to ensure it was the card and nothing wrong with my camera.  It definitely showed the card was the problem.  Luckily, I had recently done a download.  Won't trust my pictures to this brand again
In short, why a 1 Star Rating you wonder?Took forever to set up properly; long wait time and poor help from tech support; automatic set-up I doubt will ever work for anyone.  Though it does work once finally set up.__________________________________________________________So I decided to go wireless at home with a new laptop, new wireless router, and a wireless print server (PS), so I can put the printer in the garage and free up space in the house.I did a lot of research and decided to get a Belkin router (F5D7231-4) and this PS from the same manufacturer so hopefully they would set-up easily together. This is definitely not the case!First be warned this product IS NOT WPA compatible!  Thus, even though the router is WPA able, you cannot use WPA with the PS and thus have to use WEP for the network once this product is used.  Hopefully in the future this product will support WPA, but it would only hopefully do so thru a Firmware Upgrade.  Do not think this PS is WPA compatible.Next, be warned the box says "3 Minute Easy Install" - well it took me about 12 hours total to get the PS working now wirelessly.  I am not a computer techie, but I am smart, a great problem solver, and savvy enough to teach myself how to create a whole html website with hundreds of pages.  I tried to set-up the PS on a static IP address, as recommended by my techie friends, but this just did not happen.  Thus, next time I restart the router it may assign the PS a different IP address and then I'll have to find it thru the router interface and reconfigure the printer set-up for that new address-so I plan to spend more time in the future revisiting this issue.The crux of how I got it to work is by using the router interface and entering the MAC addresses of the PS and computers in the network.  This is the golden key I searched for for hours trying all permutations of all the other settings in the router's and PS's web interfaces.  Only this way was I able to unhook the LANd-line from the PS to the router and get it to interface and thus work wirelessly.Belkin tech support had medium wait time, friendly techs (not always speaking English without thick accents though), and they were unable to solve my golden key for me.  They even promised a chief tech would call me back but that never happened.So, yes, the product works fine but just be warned from someone perhaps like yourself that I had to learn way more about this whole network/configuration issue than I ever wanted or expected to, and I had to manually configure the whole set-up to get this product to work.
This was the worst electronics puchase I've ever made.  When I first got the mini it was great, looked nice and sounded great.  Within about 6 months battery life started to go way down, after a year it was down to nothing, didn't work properly, would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes.  If you're going to take a chance on an iPod, definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one
I had my Pink iPod mini since Feb. 2005. It was fine until it died the next year on the exact day I got it, and the warranty ran out. I got it repaired at an Apple reseller, and then it died again  on the warranty expiration date. What is it with the iPods? It's like they have a self destruct inside! ):-
I've been looking for this style of phone for a while, looks great, works great but it's so tiny as to be a pain in the rump to use.  It's both more narrow width wise and length wise than my Samsung SPH-A900. When the Samsung is fully opened this is still a smaller phone. I want a small sleek mobile phone, but this phone is impractical for using for long periods at home.  If it we're 1/3 larger it'd be excellent, maybe a great phone for women. Also it does not have any plugs for headsets.  I am returning mine to Amazon
I do not leave feedback of any kind on amazon.com, but this time as I was listening to my car audio today, I was compelled to leave one for others. This product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments I bought for mp3 player/audio system. Its sound reproducing/transmission from mp3 player to car audio is of inferior quality. It does not balance well the low/high frequency sounds, resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity. Mine worked ok for the first several hours I assume. I think it damaged the speaker, and it now sounds like it's going to rip apart. Someone else left review explaing this trouble, which I ignored, which was a mistake. Again, don't buy.
My wait has been 17 weeks and I received my monthly email today pushing out the delivery date another 30 days.  ONE BIG DIFFERENCE!!!!  THE ITEM IS NOW LISTED AS AVAILABLE BUT FOR  MORE MONEY THAN I AGREED TO PAY BACK IN NOVEMBER.  IF THIS IS AMAZON'S WAY OF MAKING ME TAKE A WALK AND GIVE CIRCUIT CITY MY $$$, IT WORKED
This is a terrible product.  If you can get it to print, the labels look great, but it will only print a few labels before stops for no reason that I can find. I get an error that it didn't print but no reason why. I've installed on two different PCs, one is brand new and same thing happens.  Software is also pretty useless.It also prints many blank labels which gets quite expensive.The online help is a joke and the technical support take 48 hrs to respond.
I was expecting at least a degree worth of difference, it did NOT help at all!Absolute waste of 50 dollars
The ToshibaMD14F52 arrived defective. Some channels would not function properly - ghost images and snow on screen. We have direct connect cable with 5 other TVs that work perfectly. Toshiba customer service was horrible to deal with; they were evasive,would not listen to my explanations but insisted on telling me to try what I had already tried to make the TV work. They also told me to call my cable company for help. Finally, after talking to several different unhelpful and unfriendly Toshiba people, I was referred to a TV repair agent for Toshiba that turned out to be unsavory, dishonest, given to lying and refusing to demonstrate he had fixed the TV as he claimed. He refused to plug it in to show it worked. Well, as I suspected, when I got home and tried the TV, he had left the TV as non-functional as it was when he received it, but insisted it was fixed. He told me to buy an external TV antenna and not use my cable TV! I will never buy another Toshiba TV again
Had this set of speakers for close to a year now. They really are nothing special for the price. ONE problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift (if you lock in a signal at all)! They do come with power cord to plug each speaker into AC. I have outside wiring so this is no trouble. TWO if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out.If you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone, and mounting them in a high traffic area (I mounted mine high above head level), DON'T PURCHASE THEM
These speakers, in one word, suck.  I made the mistake of buying them because they were so cheap.  I guess I forgot the old adage "You Get What You Pay For", didn't I?They worked "okay" when I first installed them.In a week, I got bad signals and the speakers didn't work properly.Worse purchase I've ever made!!  Don't make the same mistake I did, please!  Spend the extra money and get quality speakers
this product does not hold the smaller ipods well at all, only should be bought by people with the bigger model ipods.
I use a plastic water bottle and the only part that is kept cold is the bottom. 
I own a Magellan Meridian Marine unit. Just found out that you can only get 1 access code per program. I purchased 2 64 meg cards in hopes of downloading more than 1 map per card. Not only can I not down load more than 1 map, I cannot get an access code for additional cards. Lost money all the way around.Magellan offered me the opportunity to buy the Blue Nav XL charts at $179.00, but low and behold, they come with the same defect of 1 unlock code per program.I was a believer in Magellan, but switching to Garmin today!David
I bought this item because Amazon never had the 3M model I wanted in stock.  So I settled for this one.  That was a big mistake.  The wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your CPU very unstable.  The spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the CPU.  It is really a two person operation.  Finally, if your CPU has a side access panel, you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer.  Take a look at the 3M CS100 stand.  I think it is a much better design
This item will not work with PIXMA MP810 printers.  None of the photo pigments are compatpable with this unit.  I am now the proud owner of a CLI-8PC ink tank that is completely useless to me. I suppose it's my fault since, when I looked at these reviews several other people had the same problem.  Let all other buyers be aware and not make the same mistake
Do not buy this unit.  I have tested the VoSky, IOGEAR and now US Robotics and they are ALL junk.  While the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate.  I do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit.  And why are the SO SMALL!?  The are so small as to be practically useless.  The IOGEAR unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons.Bottom line: Wait until someone comes out with a quality item or shell out big bucks and buy a Polycom and the Computer Calling Kit that is available through Polycom.  (Even the Polycom Computer Calling Kit is analog!  What is the problem!?
Very simply put, the sound is wonderful - the design stinks.  I too crazy glued the rubber earcups to the plastic earphones - that lasted 2 days and they fell off.I don't know what Bose is thinking - clearly they are not doing any end-user testing.Update - Bose has issued replacement earcups which apparently don't fall off.  Pretty cool - I gotta upgrade my rating from 2 to 
This item was not practical. It looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional
this product is great the only problem I have is that upon downloading the drivers for this item I get a warning from my server stating that this devise does not have an Id certificate and it advises me not to use this item for it may damage my computer. I want to use this item but I am afraid to please verify you certificate so I can complete my downloa
This is a recorder with many nice features but mine lasted only a few dozen hours (but did make it beyond the very short warrenty).  It was well cared for and still does not have even the tiniest scratch but it simply did not last long.  For the price I expected a durable and well built machine. I was very disappointed and could not personally recommend it
If your router is not by D-Link, and particularly if you use WPA encryption with that router, do not purchase the DGL-3420.  I have tested it with both the Linksys WRT54G and the SMC 2804WMBP-G, and WPA fails with both of them.  D-Link technical support, in fact, has confirmed that THEY know the adapter doesn't work using WPA with the WRT54G.Besides, for significantly less money you can get a wireless bridge with a lot more functionality.  After this product failed for me, I purchased the Netgear WGPS606, which can connect FOUR items (X-Box, computer, whatever) to your wireless network AND two wireless print servers, all for $20 less (on Amazon)
When this jumpdrive was plugged into my Windows 2000 system, the software that it loads corrupted the boot sector of my hard drive. The Lexar "technical support" was no help at all. They told me to reinstall my system.Luckily the computer repair person I hired was able to recover my data files before the OS was reinstalled. Lexar would not cover one dime of my repair cost.I will never purchase one of their product again
When it worked, it did as described, but twice it stopped functioning and all data was lost.  Now when it is connected the computer fails to recognize it.  There are many better, more reliable brands, such as the Sony Micro Vault which I have now.  Nevertheless I wouldn't put anything on these that I didn't have backed up.  These drives heat up if you leave them connected to the computer.  Heat will cause them to fail faster
I bought two Lexar thumbdrives, over other brands, partially based on their rebate offers. Despite my methodical record keeping and submission, I simply got post cards saying that I did not "meet" the rebate requirements (in place of the rebate checks).  The first time it happened, I thought it was, oh well, my fault, But the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission. This is simply frank fraud by Lexar, on a smaller scale, therefore not worth customers' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further. I hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again
I bought this slick looker for the desk in my office. I had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.However its tuner worked ok and I figured with the Tivoli rep I'd get some good listening along with the good looks. My office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky...the tuner for the PA speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right. I was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal. A station would tune in  nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable. I bought an amplified antenna but didnt help. Then I tried it in a windowed room and same problem......I was very disapointed
Ok.... I bought one of these as a refurb thinking that it was a great bargain... hey 5GB for less than $100 what a deal.  Once you get the hang of loading and working with the Windows Media Player its not a big deal to load.  Unfortunately after it begins locking up and not recognizing songs (which requires a drive reformat and reinstallation of the songs) you get really good at it.  Had it for about 4 months before it stopped even recognizing the HD and no longer worked at all.  I thought maybe the reason was that I had bought a refurb so a new one had to be better... right?So I stupidly bought a brand new one.. again less than $100.  This one has now begun the lock up and reload problem within 2 months of reciept and I just recently got the "not recognizing the HD" message.  I am in hopes of getting it to work but for right now its just an expensive paperweight.  I am 0/2 with these players so I don't believe that they are worth the shipping it takes to send them back.  Beware of this product
This is the worst pice of electronics I ever bought. Started falling apart after few days only. Battery life is a joke.Software that comes with it is totally unfriendly and even if you manage to install that thing on your computer it won't work with OS prior to XP. You will find that out after you're done installing it. Mediocre performance. Don't waste your money on this one.
I have an iPaq PDA and I own a TomTom GPS -- both of which work well.  This combo iPaq/TomTom is 'in the rough' and needs to undergo some re-tooling. I'm surprised that other reviewers mention what I deem significant flaws and then go on to rate the unit as a 4 or 5 star. For example, the Travel Companion stalls and needs soft-resets.  For a right handed person, the stylus is awkward.  Support is not good. Moving through programs can be painfully SLOW. The GPS tracking lags. I depend on my GPS and PDA for business travel.  Buy the rx5915 if you like to play with gadgets as it's loaded with some fun stuff. But, not if you need something dependable while on the road.   
What a lousy battery.Used it on my clock and it leaked.I would never use it again. ..
I value the Amazon Product Reviews and have purchased many items based on customer feedback.  I purchased this phone from Home Depot for $69.95.  I am returning it today.  It is to large for comfort, the reception is bad, the letters too small for those of us who need reading glasses... I could go on
I ordered the Cisco Aironet 1231 the other day, and after it arrived, set it up, and...couldn't get a wireless signal. I called customer support and was told I would be called back by a technician (which obviously the first person was not) within an hour. We waited...and got online to try to figure things out. Turns out that in VERY small print on an obscure documentation page of the 1231 it says at the very bottom that two external antennae are needed for the 2.4 GH wireless (802.11b/g) to work. I was even more disappointed to find out that the required antennae were available online for only $16 a piece, which makes Cisco look really cheap for not including such a small but vital item with a $500 router.Although it took an astonishing twelve hours for customer support to get back to me, since I registered my complaint with them they have been very helpful. I really hope that they improve their web site-it really is not that helpful since you have to weed through pages of documentation before you can even begin to find information you need. I still haven't used this router since I'm waiting for the required antennae I had to order somewhere else. Cisco routers are supposed to be good, but as a warning to you, the potential customer, be aware that 1) you need to purchase external antennae with this product; 2) my initial experience with customer service was pretty disappointing
Extremely disappointed, especially after having done a lot of research and read the great reviews that this product (and the Axion 7" player) received.  I bought it for my wife for a road trip and she was excited about the large screen and the ability to connect an antenna to watch tv.  The player worked fine for the first DVD we tried, but after that the screen freaked out and went almost black.  You couldn't see a picture but you could hear the movie just fine.  No complaints about the sound I guess, but what good is that if the screen doesn't work?Needless to say I returned this as fast as possible.  In fact, if I could rate it less than one star I would, since it didn't even last one day. Terrible product
I have had this Kensington FM transmitter for about 2 months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static.Unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical, jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages VERY FRUSTRATING.  During the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal. I haven't measured it but it seems like as little a 10-15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior.This makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles.  If you listen to quiet music, avoid at all costs.  If you don't it is the best transmitter I have tried.Sirandar 
While I'm driving, this thing doesn't work at all. There's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time. The only time this FM transmitter works is when my car is still. Maybe it's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter can't reach it. Overall, I'd say this product is garbage
This junk absolutley ruined an otherwise mildy scratched CD. Avoid at all costs unless you want to completely destroy a CD. What was in that bottle, toilet cleaner
I bought this product and was very disappointed by it.  Not only did it damage my head to my c.d. writter, it also destroyed my hard drive in the process. Eri
This player is junk.  It would not play music for more than two hours before going dead.  When I called Toshiba, the person that I talked to claimed he wasn't aware battery life was even a problem.  I directed him to read some of the reviews on C-NET, which I discovered after I bought it. (My fault) It was finally returned and the battery was replaced.  Now (after two weeks) it won't even hold a charge.  I'm returning it and will not recommend this to anyone
The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.If this is an example of Grundig's work, I'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products.
I've had these speakers for three years now. Hissing, popping, not holding signal-- all that has been true from day 1. And tonight, one of the speakers just would not turn on. The power supply wasn't the problem-- it's something inside the speaker box, and something that apparently cannot be fixed.So my other one will be mono until I can come up with an alternative solution.Oh well..
We wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom.  The reason I give two stars is because of Beach Camera's return policy.  They grudgingly allowed me to return it, as a one-time courtesy with a restocking fee.  I wish Amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company
I have gone through 4 pairs in 4 months because they keep breaking, one thing after another.   Either one ear stops or they both stop in the same Hour!!!  I wouldn't dare unless you can return them easy
I bought the ear buds to replace the ones that came with my iPod. I used it for about fifteen minutes and then the left earbud would not transmit any sound. Sending these ones back. I must say that the earbuds kept outside sound out very well (Much to my Mom's dismay, she couldn't fuss at me :-P ). Oh well.
The description gives the impression that the material is made of hard rubber and that it can protect you ipod in "rugged" conditions. In reality it is made from very thin flimsy rubber. I suppose will protect you nano from scratches and other cosmetic damage, but it will not porvide any protection from drops or other rough handling
Has anyone else experienced the following ?: Used the first twenty or so in a stack of 100 without any problems, then have run into (so far) a run of at least 30 defective discs after the remainder sat unused for a few months. After various attempts to narrow down the problem, I tracked it down to the blank CD-Rs. I had exactly the same problem occur with another brand, which was replaced with these TDKs. Is there some unwritten shelf life for blank CD-Rs or am I just unlucky?
Creating a DVD, using iMovie to iDVD EVEN on a PowerMac G5 Quad (superfast, supergreat!) is a 4-5 hour process. A 10-15% FAILURE rate, due to POOR media quality is UNACCEPTABLE! The 'quality control' at MEMOREX sucks! It is NOT so much the cost of the bad DVDs, but, there are superficial scratches on the recording surface of 5-8 out of every 50 I have used, causing a failure to burn, after a VERY lengthy set up process. I will be using VERBATIM blank media  . .FROM NOW ON!
I would not buy this again.  The edge of the pouch impinges on the earphones connection and already wore out I set of earphones.  The attachment to a belt is tricky to use, cant be done one handed and frequently unlatches when I am moving around.  I am in the market for a better one
I bought the KX-TG5571 and an extra handset after being so pleased with it'spredecessor KX-TG5471.The 5571 handset does not have a FLASH BUTTON!What you have to do instead is press the speakerphone button, wait for options to appear on the screen and then press a different button to access the FLASH function and there is NO WAY to figure that out whilelooking at the handset.WHY
This was the top rated system by Consumer Reports.  I returned it.  The sound quality of the message I recorded as a greeting sounded awful as did the sound of the messages I received. Tried to record my greeting a number of ways, but they all sounded awful.
This portable TV sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design.  They don't tell you that there is NO ANTENNEA nor that the TV will not work without an antennea!  The portable DVD player is great. THE TV IS HORRIBLE.  When we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken.  DON'T BUY THIS FOR THE TV!  We ended up purchasing a different product that had the antennea built in.  This one was a total waste of money
The product does not work in my view. I have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95% of the cases. It is not much different than entering the information manually. The character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective. Does not even recognize that "wireless" is the mobile phone number. One would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years. The only good thing is once you scan the cards, you can throw them away, but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand.
Like others, I was very pleased (initially) with the very quick installation of this router.  Since I am very familiar with Linksys products, working through the web utility to configure the router is a snap.  I was up an running inside 5 minutes.   Signal strength was awesome, and I had an iMac connected wirelessly with WPA security and an XP machine connected through the ethernet port.   Life was good.........After a few days of blissful surfing, I tried to connect a Mac PowerBook pro to the network.   Bad idea -- would not connect unless the wireless security was turned off completely (another bad idea.)  After resetting the router a few times it made the whole system very unstable.   The iMac now loses it's connection every 15 minutes or so.  Soooooo, once again I'm resigned to spending fruitless hours on a tech support line to a faraway land.   I purposely stayed with 802.11g because this technology is several years old and SHOULD be rock solid.  I found a forum at [...] that proved to me that many others are having DHCP problems with these routers.  There's no excuse for having to spend this much time setting up a very simple network!  If I hadn't already tossed the box, I would be returning it for a refund.
I bought this product to help cleaning the lense of my auto cd player. I tried it for at least 10 times, but no luck. Wet clean the lense manually is the best way, but that will include getting the player out from the dash board
I owned this product for about one week, very nice little piece which I can take to work or jogging, but today when I am copying some files to it from my computer, it stopped working, even reset didn't work, so I will  return it for a refund and try different products
I purchased this to work with my Xbox 360, I wanted to try this cable type with my new Onkyo 7.1 home theater since I was using the old composite for sound. I heard more disortion and fuzz then if you but a soda can in a blender. I qucikly ran to Best Buy to buy a Monster fiber optical cable it was about 50.00 dollars more. But then the sound was incredible I couldn't beleive what I was hearing. I gave it two stars since the cables build was so so but not half as thick as Monsters. (Maybe I got a bad model give it a shot it's only a couple dollars)
This is the same unit that HP sells, but has Lite on do its support. Great unit for about a month. Support is not good.
I was not aware until purchasing, that the U3 Smart Drive by Kingston would not run just any software but only certain programs therefore it is mostly useless to me.  However I will use it as a general back up thumb drive
I got this case for my WS-320M, which I've been wearing around my neck like a MP3 player.The material of the case seems to be genuine leather (or really good vinyl) and brushed felt.  It looks good = professional looking.I've enclosed what I hope are representative pictures of this case.  All the buttons of the recorder are accessible.  Even when the flap is closed, the microphone/headphone jacks are available, as are the REC/STOP/PLAY buttons.  If the 2 tiny holes on top of the recorder are apertures for the built-in microphone, you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well.  There is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the "HOLD" button on the side of the recorder.  Not only does this prevent the recorder from jostling around, but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the "HOLD" button.  However, since the HOLD button is meant to slide down (away from the microphone) for it to be released, if the recorder was accidently pulled out of the case, the resulting friction would actually unlock the "HOLD" button.The belt loop is an adjustable velcro.  I would have preferred a sewn-on belt loop (so the case cannot come off the belt accidently) or a nice stiff clip (for easy access), or even a riveted snap button, but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options. Most of this opinion of mine is probably based on my bias against in velcro in general - they seem to be just weak enough to cause problems at the most inopportune times.The case is closed shut with another velcro strap,All in all, it seems to be designed to merely protect the surface of the recorder during transport.  Or, being able to put it on your belt AFTER everything else (line-in MIC, headphone, recording/playing) is set up.  The relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the recorder is inside the case (mainly due to very small buttons), as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand, would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the recorder inside the case.  The case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket, and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the recorder.My bias lies in that I like to use it as an MP3 player, and I wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap/loop from a flash drive.  Placing the recorder on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone/mic to fall out from the waving of arms and such.I think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt.On one positive note, I believe this is the first time that I was the first reviewer for anything from Amazon.  Woo Hoo
I live in the Wash. DC area and we have pretty bad traffic.  I normally take a route that isn't extremely bad but does has congestion.  I get no warnings at all.Also, recently there was a smaller side road (Non-Highway but well used road) that was closed on both directions but had no information on this road.  The antenna works but Clear Channels Traffic information sucks.Sucks really bad.  When I check the traffic information, the only information I get is the main large interstate highways.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.  Who knows, maybe the XM traffic service is better but I can honestly tell you Clear Channel Traffic Service SUCKS!Maybe I'll get some traffic information traveling on I-95 somewhere...Sorry for the unproffesionalism but its the honest truth
Very disappointing! I was hoping I could at least get one or two viewable network affiliate VHF stations. Instead, the best the antenna could pull in was color-enhanced snow and sound laced with static. Tried all three antenna hook-up options. In fact, my set pulled in the same signal with or without the antenna
Please don't be fooled by it's inexpensiveness. I am a victim of it. I already bought this card and within 2 weeks I started getting read and write errors. I formatted the card and it now has 2 MB of bad sectors.  Unlike the other reviewer I did had 2 GB to begin with. But I think it is bad quality product and thats why it is dearth cheap. It is not at all reliable.  Now I am contacting their customerservice to replace this card for me
This printer is a piece of junk. The print mechanism is constructed of flimsy plastic so that unless care is taken in inserting the print cartridges, the mechanism is likrly to be damaged. Like other HP printers operating under XP, it is almost impossible to cancel a pring job in case of a problem ( e.g. paper jam, paper out). Cancelling a print job results in a "deleting document message" which remains until printer is disconnected (you can turn it off under these circumstances) and computer is rebooted. Often XP hangs up and the computer must be poered off withexiting windows properly which results in a long diskcheck on repowering. I have long had this problem with an older HP model, but had hoped they had corrected this problem in their software by now, but alas.... The crown of it all is the life of the ink cartridge. The tricolor cartridge, costing about $18 at Wal-Mart, lasts for about 12 8 x 10 photos before the ink low warning comes up.In sumarry: Don't buy this printer whatever the price. It would probably be wise to avoid HP inexpensive printers altogether.
I experienced what seemed to be a common problem for many people that have purchased av cables for the ipod. I was able to get the audio but no picture was available despite following the advice of other reviewers to set my TV out signal to on. It didn't help that no manual was included in the box to assist with troubleshooting.
Looking at the photo of this item, I noticed the plug at the end of this car lighter charger is NOT the screw on contraption needed for my eXplorist 400, so I was hesitant to purchase it until I did further research and found out WHY the plug is different.You still need the USB cable that came with the eXplorist and have to bring it in the car too!The big AC plug detaches from the USB cable, and AHA!  Now you have a jack that this car charger can plug into!   Then you screw that cable onto your GPS unit as when you charge it via AC.In other words...  This charger does NOT plug into your GPS, it plugs into your GPS charger cable which attaches to your GPS.But I don't want to take that cable in the car with me, because if it gets damaged or lost, then I can never charge the unit at all, not even at home with AC.    So I was forced to find and purchase another USB cable assembly seperately, to keep in the car with this car lighter charger.Magellan should have just put the screw on connector at the end of this car charger instead of the way they did it.The car lighter charger has a nice coiled cord, but what good is it?  You still have to have the long USB cable attached to it anyway!But hopefully this will help everyone, that like me, was puzzled by the photo of the item and the connector that isn't going to fit anywhere in the eXplorist 400
I bought this last Christmas for my three year old and five year old.  Thesound of the piano is a little off, but all in all the piano is nice for the price.  The leg of the stool breaks very easily.  Don't buy unless you can fix
I have no axe to grind with Bose.  I originally bought this speaker for a custom cabinet with almost no room for a center channel set up.  This speaker has an incredibly small footprint.  If space is limited, this is not a bad option.  However, being honest, this is not a great center channel speaker.  Choosing speakers is like the addage "certain horses for certain courses."  Your budget, your room, your components - all play a part.I have two home theater setups.  One is a daily gathering area with basic in wall treatments from Polk Audio.  The other is a dedicated theater utilizing Definitive Technologies with B Reference 7.1 Processing.  Clearly the Bose VCS-10 can not hold its own with my larger setup.  However, I have run it with my Polk Audio's and it was workable.  The timbre match was slightly off and the vocals were not as sharp as they are with my Polk CSi3 but it was not awful.My bottom line - you can certainly buy a better center channel speaker.  Can you buy a better one in this price range.  I think so - if you are only focused on the quality of this one speaker and not the blended sound of your system.  You should always buy the best components within your budget - but remember you are building a system - it's not just about one speaker.  If this speaker fits your space and (more importantly) matches your other speakers, then it may be the right speaker for you
I purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my Bose main speakers for my surround sound set up.  At that time, I felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as I listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups I came to realize that the Bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par.  So last year, I purchased a Polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane.  The Polk speaker which costs the same as the Bose ($199) was far and away the better product.  The sound is cleaner, crisper, sharper...it made watching movies much more enjoyable.   I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on all these years.  The only reason I purchased the Bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound I have now with Polk center and Bose main is excellent.   Depending on who you ask, the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system.  If that's true then I wouldn't recommend Bose because all you're doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me that's a waste of money.  I know because I made that mistake. 
I bought this speaker about one year ago from Best Buy, very disappointed.  The sound quality is terrible, I have two presence channel $15 KLH speakers that sound better than this.  No high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic, hence why Bose is not  high end.  After a year of misery on my ears, I've replaced this with a Paradigm center speaker that only cost $20 more, and the difference is not even comparable.  Do not buy this, or any Bose product at all.  Save your money and buy Paradigm, B, or similar, most of the time they cost a little bit more, but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers, and you will get your money's worth
Believe me, this is not worth it!  Get a Kensington.  I already wasted my money on this, don't buy it.  Horrible signal to noise ratio, poor reception, cannot modulate to more than 4 frequencies.  DOES NOT WORK
I'm usually a big linksys supporter. This is an exception. This device is a joke. Not a very funny one. The first thing I was told when I called for support was it most likely wouldn't work with my printer (Canon MP950). I spent several hours trying to get a linksys router to see this thing with online support. Don't waste your time
I followed the install instructions to the letter, but the install program started giving me an error that I couldn't get past.  I downloaded the latest install from the Linksys web site and got past the point where I had been getting the error, but I couldn't get the print server to connect to my wireless network.  When I had the print server connected to my network via an Ethernet cable, it detected the attached printer but couldn't even print a test page successfully.  This product was a complete waste of time
This was my first, and only, purchase of a Linksys product. I unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer, then hooked it up to another printer, only to have it die just out of warranty. A completely worthless piece of Chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer doesn't even stand behind it
I've had this phone for approx. 9 months now, maybe longer...and I truly don't know how I've stood using this dual phone system for so long.  However, tonight I've taken a giant step "upward" towards better quality and design with the Panasonic KX-TG 5432M dual system.  This dual handset is the worst I've ever experienced in a cordless system.  From the moment I set it up, the static has been atrocious.  Step away from the base unit over ten feet and it sounds like someone gargling gravel or a mad cat hissing in your ear.  I can't even step into my attached garage to talk with someone without major static to the point of not even being able to be heard by the other person.  Even within six feet of the base I receive intermittent static that becomes obnoxious and distracting, not only to me, but to the other person on the other end...for they hear it too. I will never purchase another uniden product, if this is the non-quality of product they put out.  I had a 2.4 mhz system that would outshine this system...and I wish I'd never gotten rid of it.As the title says...If you desire a lot of static when you talk on a phone, this is the system you need to bring that crackling symphony of music to your ear. The melodic consistancy this system creates in ones enjoyment of talking on the phone will not put you to sleep, but rather increase your aggravation of dealing with what sounds like a major electrical storm going on inside your head. Uniden should be ashamed of this product.Stepping down from the soapbox now..
Syntax clearly states that their warranty is only good for the origninal purchaser. I got my daughter one as a gift, gave it to her bran new, in the factory sealed box and Syntax refuses to honor the warranty, (and yes I calld everywere and tried everything).
We bought this machine for a Christmas present for the inlaws, knowing I'd wind up installing it. The first disk played fine, but while I was eating lunch my father-in-law tried moving to a different CD. It wouldn't play. It'd go back to the first disk and play it fine. So, I shut it down, restarted on disk 2 and now it played fine, but wouldn't go back and play disk 1! I moved the disks around to other slots and still they skipped like an old-fashioned vinyl record with a scratch. Both CDs worked fine in another player. In the meantime, mother-in-law is busy putting her collection of CDs into groups for me to program. Not this holiday season. This sucker's going back to the big box store from wence it came!
I just bought these matte labels. When I printed a photo, I noticed that photos come out at the ultra lowest quality, and the worst part is that everything printed on these labels SMUDGE when fingers are lightly run over the labels.Has anyone experienced this? Please share your story
I did not receive the correct product that I ordered.  I informed the seller and he stated that I would need to resell on ebay myself.  Very disappointed with his service.kell
Long periods of garbled static mixed with random brief moments of actual FM reception. This is in town trying to receive a major station. I am packaging this up and its going back today. This is my second try with Sony that has miserably failed. Guess maybe I should be looking at another mfg
I purchased this headset to wear to the gym to tune into their TV's to watch programs rather than listen to music.  Reception was horrible!!!  While I was in the gym I tried just listening to the radio and couldn't even get that to come in clear.  The only time it was partially clear was if you were standing outside and it was clear skies!  Not impressed at all!  I will be returning this and maybe buy the $12 generic set instead
I also had the model before the M85V and got great reception.  This new model gets terrible reception.  I still have my old model and put the old one next to the new one and it was like night and day with the reception.  Don't waste your money on this model!
Reception is only acceptable if you are seated with the headphone antenna adjusted to maximize signal strength
I hate this unit with a passion and I sell the things. Its cheap, 299.99 at most retail place right now and that's what you are getting. The One died in 24 hours, while plugged in and never turned back on. It also directed us to a road that was headed into the Pacific Ocean, there is no road across in the pacific last time I checked. It acquired Satelites ONCE and then never acquired them again. And good luck talking to customer service, both I talked to didn't speak english...A dreadful unit, maybe TomTom could go work at Walmar
Mouse movement is extremely slow. It literally takes 10 (!) seconds to get from one side of the screen to another (800x600). I just got it from OfficeDepot [...].Buttons are too small and hard to control. Joystick is unresponsive
It works if there's a direct line of sight to the reciever.  In other words, if the ipod is lying down horizontally, it won't respond.  You'll want to use a dock or something else to prop it up vertically for it to work
Should have believed all the other negative reviews.  Didn't work in my Honda Civic and didn't work in my Nissan Altima, both with original manufacturer tape decks.  In both cases, the tape deck whirred for a bit, then ejected the SmartDeck
Do NOT buy this if you own the c340--it doesn't fit and Amazon shouldn't market this as if it will. It's a nightmare to have to get it returned and get a refund.  This is also true for the cigarette lighter adapter--I hope there will be clarity as to which accessories go with each model otherwise, you'll be in for a lot of wasted time and money.  The Garmin is great, but the fact that most of their accessories are not compatible within the product family is a huge problem. 
Disaster. Supposed to work in conjunction with cordless phone extensions but WILL NOT work with other desk phones! It ONLY works with cordless phones. I wanted a desktop phone on every desk with the cordless as a convenient extra feature but now every office is stuck using only the very clumsy cordless handset. We were not informed of this until after we purchased and installed the phones. No mention of the hold 'music' in the manual. This product is a mess. STAY AWAY. Get a real phone system
After the last Panasonic 4-line debacle....1 key failes in 6 months on ALL handsets YIKES! and with not having a lot of other choices on the market we were forced to buy the new edition of the Panasonic Phone. How bad could it be, we figured.  They have to have figured out how to build a decent handset buy now.  Well, the handset is probably ok, but when we took it 20 feet from the base we lost signa1. WHAT!!?  Called Panasonic and of course customer service probably had never seen the phone suggested to unplug the battery...For Heaven's Sake. Hang up, call back, next person educates me that 5.8 Ghz just means clearer signal, but range is shorter.  WTF??!  We immediately boxed this PIECE OF JUNK up and sent it back!!  Do yourself a favor, buy from a different manufacturer
If there were a catagory for 0 stars, that's what I would have rated it. I bought this model only because I wanted a TV that would fit into a small space on a kitchen counter. The radio works, the CD works, but the TV died after l month. And the TV was the only part I was interested in. What kind of product is this? I would like Amazon to pick up this item and issue me a credit. Carol Gruber
Really won't use the TV, but the CD only lasted 5 days and I use it everyday--had to buy something else
Basic connectivity and wireless work. Any attempt to use advanced firewall rules fail including VPN passthrough.  This device could not have gone through even a rudamentory test cycle.  Please read the reviews, this is common and these problem were confirmed by my IT dept and also by D-Link's tech's as well.  On second one, all of the exact same problems.Sad to have made a choice, hope they make it right
Had to give it one star BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING LOWER.This printer was the answer to my printing dreams. For about three months, with LIGHT home use. Only fault at that time is it is LOUD. It will wake the dead. Which is OK, since the DEAD don't have to print things that often, this is the perfect printer for them...Other than noise, a faulty "load paper" error kept coming up.Then, the paper load went bad. It is very unreliable, and ink cartridges run out VERY QUICKLY and cost about 10 bucks a pop,Tonight, I'm trashing it. Buying ANOTHER printer tonight!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH
This printer does produce some fine output.  That is when it works.  The paper feed constantly refues to load paper.  The film scanner should have been left off all together (not worth using).  I have been looking everywhere for a recall on this unit (read ALOT of negative reviews).  I have been a long time HP fan, but after this experience I am going to look elsewhere. My advice is to NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRINTER
I just lost my synch adapter and it is on back order everywhere.  Unfortunately this is necessary to connect to computer and to charge the player.  Earliest date I can find one is 10/23 due to some shipping problem with creative labs.  I'm at a loss now that the battery is dead.  This is the dumbest idea ever.  Why didn't they design the player so that the cords attached directly to the player?  I agree that you should order a back-up as this thing is so easy to lose and so important
Obviously, it's cheap. But I've had mine over a year now.... no it hasn't failed, but it does scare me.  besides the plastic cracking, the fan is making me nervous.  About half the time now when I turn it on the fan make this really loud buzzing noise, which changes frequency over time, slowing down.  I have a bad feeling that the fan is not held in alignment well, and that the loud noise is the fan blades scraping against their surroundings (because it vibrates quite a bit).  This vibration can only mean bad things for the drive inside, and I'm not looking forward to the day when my cheapo choice of enclosure causes my HD to crash and lose all my photos, music, backups, etc.Currently shopping for a replacement, and I would not recommend this
I ordered two of these. For the first one, neither the firewire nor the USB worked on my iMac G5 (MacOS 10.3.9). A copy would start, and then hang after a while. I returned it and the second one worked using USB, but the firewire would hang like the first one.A friend has one that works fine with his iBook G4 under 10.3.
The user interface was horrible. The product documentation was even worse. I still can't figure out how to perform a regular scan, no OCR. This was poorly designed, poorly supported. Get some other scanner, this one is impossible
One month in the wall and sounds like a expresso machine. My car's engine sounds better. Don't waste your money. I called Sharp and they say is the fan. Great, maybe I should remove it and use ice cubes
the problem is I have more than one guitar this one is my least favorite. P.S. has bad soun
this is a piece of junk holy cow is it cruddy don't even call it a guitar because its not its a bad thing to call it a guitar holy crud "where's the tylenol!
These work great initially...I bought six of them. Of the six, four broke. One stopped altogether, one stopped oscillating, and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed. I bought them in May and they broke after 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. They are expensive fans, and I was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability. They were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all.  I have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch. These are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty (this is 1 year)and higher quality components.
seldom do i write a review downgrading a product but this one is truly the exception.  i bought this one on ebay and thought i was getting a good deal.  price-wise, it was great.  however, it would appear that the designer of this organizer tried to put so many features into it that it ends up doing nothing well.  the directions are terrible.  they are extremely difficult to follow.  i never could get it to sync with outlook.  i fear that today i will waste more time trying to get it to work.  i owned one of the first palm pilots and it was child's play in comparison.  in this case, you get what you pay for.  don't purchase this, you'll be sorry.   Take care, it's a time bandit and even if it were to function flawlessly, the design with all of its attempted functions is way too much.  punch this button to get to this screen which will take you to the next screen, ad nauseum.  do you carry the manual with you.  put together in another country and probably by someone not entirely familiar with the English language.  truly disappointed with this worthless plastic. 
The paper stripes of 1/4" are too wide. at times Information such as names and phone numbers came out very clear. IF somebody is really after information he shouldn't have much trouble finding it after you throw away your paper
very poor design..would never recommend this product.The connection is so flaky,you will end up wasting lot of time
I have owned the DMR-ES40V for over 6 months. It is a combo DVD/VCR unit. I have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit. The MANUAL:  It is imperative to have the manual. This machine is somewhat complicated, and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary. If everything is working correctly, you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it. It is overly time-consuming though, since the items don't seem to logically flow. If you dig long and hard enough though, they are in there somewhere.The SET-UP: Being somewhat experienced at setting-up a home theater, this was generally easy. The text and pictures were sufficient. Searching through the Function Menu, I learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons. This is needlessly confusing. Of course the auto clock set function isn't very accurate ( I haven't seen an accurate one yet). DVD PLAYBACK: The general playback is pretty straight-forward. I really miss some of the extra playback features that are on my JVC progressive player (which is 3 years older). Finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult. A Zoom feature is missing. Many convenience features are not present. DVD RECORDING: Recording onto a DVD-RAM disc is a dream compared to old fashioned VCR tapes. I really enjoy using them. A quirk--you must have the unit in stand-by to record from the scheduler. This mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another(on the same disc) you must wait until the unit begins recording, then select the show to watch from the Navigator. The UHF tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel 19. Other weak channels record but not 19. This problem started about 6 months after initial set-up. There is an annoying bug with Daylight Savings Time, and the newer extended time period. The Panasonic Web Site suggests going into the set-up menu and unchecking the DST box; thus removing the feature. If this did anything, it would allow you to set the clock manually. Being without the automatic DST adjustment would not be annoying, but even though you turn-off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at 7pm EST. This ruins any TV scheduling you had set. This malady persisted until the date of the former DST Spring-Ahead arrived. Several weeks of scheduling hell! I requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised. No message, no number to call--just a promise to call again when I was home. THE VCR USE: This feature is really buggy. You are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote; but this only worked for a month or two. When a TV show is scheduled for recording the unit won't tape it if you merely insert a cassette. It doesn't recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move--either playing a little or fast forwarding/reversing. This is really annoying.LAST IMPRESSION: The last movie (Last King of Scotland) I watched took over the machine. The remote control would not function, the disc would not stop, and the disc could not be ejected. It was necessary to unplug the unit, restart it, eject the disc, and totally reset all menu items--which were randomly reset to various settings. Worse some settings are no longer selectable. One other movie would not even play in the machine--forcing me to use the trusty JVC unit. I must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what I read at this forum and other ones. These units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption. I recommend looking elsewhere.
The write up sounds good, with many options and features, but after closer examination I had to take it back. First thing, it appears that the front DV plug was an after-thought for Panasonic, it's a rinky-dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main AV/S plugs are located. This is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit, retro fitting it in wherever. The tiny "button within a button" toggle switch for fastforward, reverse, etc looks like it's glued on, it won't last long with normal use, and it's hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit. The menu interface is difficult to navigate. The remote control is horrible, a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features. You might want to pass on this one, remember the saying "if it sounds too good to be true, it probabily is
I watch lots of show and some time wants to record good show while watching it also. If properly connected thru satelite dish to this unit and to TV, Is this unit record the show while watching the same show on TV? (Some of the units can not record while you are watching the show, TV has to be off !!!!!!
Operates as described but lacks browser for use in pay for connection environments, poor battery life, need to have it fully charged every day even if you did not use it the previous day.  Needs mute function. Volume could be louder, too.  I would wait and buy next generation
The product description in January 2007 is inaccurate:batery life in the standby mode is about 20 hours, not 60;there is no hands free speakerphone;if you use a standard plug-in headset, the microphone does not work (tested two units).There is more:the headset is very loud (you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear), but there is no volume adjustment;the microphone has low sensitivity, so you find yourself yelling into it;the clock resets itself when the power is turned off.I returned mine
This product has the potential to be tremendous, but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched. That absolutely ruins the iPod video experience, now that there is LCD glare exposing all the scratches.Also, there is a big 'rhigo-skin' logo on the front, which makes the case even that more distracting.I'm sure that it isn't polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail. What a letdown.P.S. if you are buying the 30GB version of this case, it will double the thickness of your setup
This keyboard folds out well and I liked the feel of the keys.However, the IR connector needs to be in direct connection with the IR port in the PDA.  For the iPaq, this port is at the bottom of the handheld.  The 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area.  In order to have the proper connectivity, you have to turn the handheld on its side.  This then requires another software program download (not freeware that I can find) to rotate your screen to the landscape view, unless you can read sideways without getting a headache.Before buying this product, check your handheld to see if your IR port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so, this may be a difficult keyboard to use
I bought this as a replacement for my stowaway when I replaced my Palm m105 with an HP IPAQ. The palm-stowaway combination was an excellent portable alternative to my laptop and I used in nearly every day.  After my positive experience I expected my new IR keyboard to function the same way.  What a dissapointment! I can forgive the large size of the keyboard but there are several aspects of this keyboard that have made it intolerable to me. I found the keys did not always respond leaving me with multiple errors to fix in every paragraph and the split space bar has been a constant source of irritation, I usually hit the solid piece of plastic in the middle instead of one of the keys.  The little plastic arms on the stand do not hold the PDA at all securely, even bumping the table can knock it off, and I have taken to using an elastic band to keep my IPAQ in place. The "mouse" arrowpad is a nice idea but does not justify the loss of the arrow keys. Finally the backlight does not stay on while using the keyboard and there is no backlight control on the keyboard (unlike the stowaway). I will be replacing this keyboard with another after a much more careful search
This VERY expensive cable is already in the package if you purchased the Forerunner 201.  You won't need this unless you somehow lost it.  Damn, it is expensive!  This is a cable for goodness sake
I purchased this because I have to do a lot of math online and was hoping I could use this for that purpose.  Also I was hoping to be able to use it for taking notes.  So far, I'm not impressed.  The pen is a crummy little plastic thing and not very satisfying to use.  It is actually very uncomfortable -- particularly when you consider you have to press VERY hard to get your entire note set to be recorded.  Talk about writer's cramp!I'm also disappointed that you can't write on it and have it instantly displayed to the computer interactively.  My fault for not understanding the functionality better but I thought this could double as a writing tablet.  I can't speak to the size of the paper since I haven't tried any other size.  In general, a big disappointment and 90 dollars that I would have been better off just setting on fire!  Another item destined for Craigslist.p.s. -- to the reviewer who was wanting handwriting recognition -- my pad did come with a trial version of a package that would convert to text.  Of course, that was of very limited use since the stooopid thing failed to capture my handwriting accurately in the first place.  But the capability is there..
I bought this printer based on its good reviews. It does print beautiful photos BUT I haven't used it that hard for it to have failed so soon. Canon said they will send me a factory refurbished replacement for the body only. The problem began with a squeak in the rollers and yesterday it would not feed the paper properly. After several attempts to get it working per the instructions in the manual I contacted Canon. They ran me through a test with the machine after which they said the only thing they would do is send the replacement body
Any pictures that I have printed with the color cartridge have come out too dard
I can't say the reason, but this card blocks all the time, after some days without use. For unblock it, I have to take it out many times and clean contacts. Then, without knowing exactly what worked, it begins to function. 
I' writing this eview onthe nwkeoard tht I picked up a few urs  Don stop redingdue to th numerous misspellins and rors.  That's the kyboard, nome!!  I'mt ba to to y na o y n Acino esr I ia.Ok, switching over to a wired keyboard!!  The above mess was me trying to type on the Microsoft 6000 V2 Keyboard!!  I'm taking it back to the store ASAP!!  According to the programs, I have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing, but you see what comes out!  Not once have I had a low signal warning or anything.  I just get random intermittent letters to appear.  Now, perhaps it's because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray, but my goodness!  This thing is supposed to have a range of 6 feet.  I measured and they're about a foot and a half apart!!I type for hours on end per day and have been typing "properly" for about 16 years.  I type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals!!  Another thing I noticed about the 6000 (and actually was concerned with it while I was trying it out in the store) is that it makes my fingers feel cramped.  Perhaps it's due to the curve of the keyboard and I'm just not used to it yet (although I have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them.  The 4000 felt fine (even though it has a somewhat awkward layout!!)No matter what, that thing is going back!  I'm far too agitated to keep it!Oh, there are some neato plusses!  I love the shortcut keys.  It's nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e-mail, my music, my pictures, or whatever else I assign the keys to.  I had gotten excited about that feature, and will be sad to lose it (even though I only had it for about an hour.)Better luck to the rest of you
Viewing the internet this monitor was great. When I tried to play a movie, DVD DISC, MPEG, AVI, ANYTHING. The picture was terrible. Very bad pixilation. I was told it might be the video card. I bought a new card XFX geforce 7600 gs, for another $150.00. Same quality on films. I tried latest driver from XFX, from nvidia, etc. Changed screen resolutions, everything you could think of, I tried. The picture for viewing movies was terrible. I hooked my old 15 inch monitor back up, the picture quality for movies is great. I have returned this monitor, now I have to wait for a refund before I will try a different monitor. The black light bleed is very bad. If you watch films on your monitor, you can't help but notice it.PS. Amazon was great about refunding shipping. Amazon is the best online store there is
Malfunctions:1. The port for connecting to a PC became loose and unreliable, frequently disconnecting while I was trying to transfer music.2. The little knob stopped working properly:  it was no longer possible to fast-forward.3. Finally, the screen cracked for me and no longer displayed anything.Design issues:It would be nice to be able to access music by ID3 tag (i.e. artist, genre, song title).It takes a long time to start up, generally ~20 seconds but up to ~2 minutes if you just changed the music on it.It's nice that you can delete music on the player without having to connect it to a computer, for instance if you have it on shuffle and you come across something that you never want to hear again.  However, the interface to do this was so inconvenient (including audio playback stopping and long lag times) that I rarely used this feature in practice.The earbuds that come with it didn't stay in my ears well; I bought new ones.Good things:I loved the fact that it had an FM radio and a voice recorder (the reasons that I bought it).It's easy to access the hard drive from any computer, without any software needed.The large storage capacity proved fully necessary.You can change playback modes with a single button press (shuffle versus ordered, all songs versus current folder only).My basis for comparison:  I've also owned a Creative Zen Jukebox (which I liked a lot but which I sold because I wanted the FM radio and voice recorder on the iAudio) and, currently, a used fourth generation iPod, which has been working well so far except for some occasional quirks
After my trusty Archos player's display broke, I figured I upgrade and get me a 60GB iAudio X5. As a journalist doing interviews, I was also very giddy to get the line-in to record interviews straight to mp3. A friend of mine loves his player, so I didn't even flinch when I saw the price.Ever since then I regret my decision.Apparently my player has a software problem. It speeds up all my mp3 files. I tried several different programs to rip the mp3s and always got the same thing. That is when I was actually able to upload mp3s, because oftentimes I received error messages and the player refused to do as told.So what then: Upgrade the firmware. Sure. If you can make it work and I couldn't. The description online is poorly written. But it's essentially like this: Start with a fully loaded battery. Unplug the A/C cabel and unpload the Firmware. Now replug the A/C cable and that should tell the player to update the firmware. Well all it does is conclude that the battery isn't full anymore so it better recharges and does nothing else.I.e. I couldn't get the firmware to update and I tried for the last hour.Therefore I'll take the player back to the store and ask for a refund. And I'll get another Archos - and continue to live with its misely 20GB
I've owned two of these now. The screen's great and I love the wireless headphones -- terrific for very small children. Our 2-year-old drove to New Mexico and back (well, we drove and he watched videos) with this thing. Unfortunately, both units broke after less than a year of use. The first one just stopped working (with a DVD permanently trapped inside). The second one just developed an intermittent white-out and screen noise that's happening once a minute now. So I am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one. All of these little players seem to have reliability problems, so my main advice to everybody is BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles -- you WILL be cashing it in
My wife dropped the original remote and it quite working.  It turns out there are PCB's inside and one surface mount connector to the other board came loose so I resoldered it and it worked for a little while, probably until the next time she dropped it.I bought the updated remote and one drop was all it took to disable the receive part of it also.  Could not find the problem this time.  It still transmitted, but eventually quit transmitting after the alarm was on.  I unlocked the truck manually and every time someone opened or closed a door the alarm would go off and I could not start the truck.  I messed with it (while in the parking lot of an amusment park) for a long time and evetually got it to stop, probably by entering valet mode, I'm not sure.Don't waste your money on another $100 remote.  I am shopping for a remote that is transmit only without the LCD.  Should be more reliable.  My suggestion is to buy a system that comes with 2 remotes: One LCD and one simple.  Better yet, buy a system that does not have the feedback, or 2 way, and save a lot of money and headache.  You won't use it anyway
I bought one of these and it broke the first day I used it.  Amazon replaced it for free, but for no good because the second one broke soon after I got it too.  Very poor laminator.  I went to Office Depot and bought one from Xerox and it works much better
The phone was very annoying. Everytime I tried to call on the phone, it would not connect. I would have to either change the channel or just not call. I was only able to connect to the number I was calling once in the 30+ times I attempted to call. I returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone. Consumers Report was very wrong in their rating of this phone. The phone was terrible !
I purchased this item to record LPs into my computer thru the input on this device.  It sounded worse than recording through the mono microphone input that was built into my laptop.  Had same experience with LOUD right out of the box too - startled me out of my skin!  Mine didn't come with any disk although the box mentions software.  Then again, I bought this from an Amazon 'partner' from Amazon.  Spend your money wisely and get an iMic.  I'm going to
The only good thing about this product is its price (I saw it being sold at $160 on some other site). There are several shortcomings though:- The greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu. There is no 'home location'. Also there are only two navigation options available - shortest time  shortest distance. So if you are caught in a traffic jam for example, there is no 'detour' function. Also, you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating. Hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa.- The maps are probably very old. I used this device in NJ, VA  MN. In every state, I faced problems multiple times, when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead  it would not tell me to keep on left/right, or it would ask me take turns when there were none. - The unit was very slow in calculating routes (I dont know how the Sirf Star III chip helps). Also it would freeze often  I would need to reset it at critical junctions.- The viaMichellin website is only dedicated to Europe. When I went to register my product, I had to register it in viaMichellin UK, since there was no option for US! I dont think they have any support for the US models.- The POIs are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range.I returned this product after trying to make it work for 2 months. It was great on part of Amazon to accept it even after expiration of return policy (although they deducted 20% restocking fee).
I really tried to like the Via Michelin, bought it with every intention of loving it in March 2007.  But I feel compelled to tell most of you to "keep shopping."  I bought it due to the excellent price, small thin size(compared to Garmin). I thought "how bad can it be?"  I ordered it and had it shipped to my door, then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it.  This is because my other GPS units were in other cars, with other family members already on other trips. I bought this one as a budget GPS, optimistic that it was new and had the Sirf-III chip.  But before long, I hated this unit, all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me, and I will tell you about it below.  First, please note there are a few positive reviews for this unit....but have you noticed they are mostly all people who have no experience with "Other" GPS units? Or they didn't spend much time with it before they reviewed it?  Or they haven't had experience with GPS in 4 years..which is like a century in terms of how fast this technology is changing? For positive reviewers, if this is their first "newer" GPS and if they are comparing it to a Car navigational GPS Of 4 years ago, then yes, it is quite a bit better. But compared to the new units like Mio 310x or the Tom Tom One (both of which I own) then the ViaMichelin has a "horrible" user interface, and is horrible to use on the roads. Tomtom and Mio, often finish what you are typing for you, they are intuitive and programmers have polished them. But the ViaMichelin is very non intuitive, absolutely dangerous to try to use on the fly.  Sure, we are not supposed to use them while we drive, and with this one it is TRULY dangerous even when you learn the complicated system.  So most of the time, you have to pull over and work on it.  But it is no fun, and even you program it, if you go to another screen it "loses" it and you have to program the history all over.  You will soon be frustrated with how many steps this unit takes to do anything, and how "lost" it often gets. I will try to give you the pros:Pros:  Small form factor, decent screen, SIRF 3 chip. NAVteq maps. Four hour battery life.  Good price for a Sirf-3 chip unit.Cons:  Horrible non intuitive software program, clunky, multi step interface that will make your life horrible if you are in a rush or emergency...or even if you are not in a hurry.  Horrible speaker..volume so poor and speaker so poor, you CAN'T hear it with any road noise present...seriously...turn speaker up all the way while driving..it will crackle and is illegible.  I read this in a review, but honestly didn't believe it until I owned it.  Third, unlike ANY GPS I've had, this one literally tells you to "start driving" before it can tell you which way to go, when you've routed it to the nearest store, etc.  Think about that!  It means sometimes you have a 50% chance of making the right choice as to which way to go...then if you guess wrong, it tells you to turn around and go the other way!  Seriously...that one feature should be enough to make you say "NO" as most GPS will at least tell you to "turn right" from where you are parked or "turn left" but this one will say "start driving" without ANY direction....because it can't seem to route until you drive onto a road.  It can't do it from a parking lot!  It already will have the satellite location...that's not it..it's a software bugaboo I think built into the programming.  It makes you "start driving" because it can't find your location or know which way you are going..until you start and it routes the direction you are traveling.  Bad software design for sure.  When you go to Canada, you have to have installed (on another SD card) the Canadian map....very inconvenient when you cross the border.  Navteq maps could not find many locations on coastal Maine. Literally, we were driving on coastal roads it said did not exist.  I found it VERY slow recalculating trips when you missed a turn (MUCH slower than my  Mio 310 which was purchasd last year, or TOM TOM ONe which was purchased this year) and this recalculation problem in busy city traffic, caused us to miss several critical exits.  Want to find POI's on the run?  Forget it. Too many steps and illogical organization compared to other major brands. It often could not find even local Walmarts...one's that have been there for 20 years.  I'm serious.  I parked in front of Walmarts that it could not find...very old Walmarts.  To be sure, Garmin, TomTom and Mio do not list ALL Walmarts, but at least they get 4 or 5 out of 7 in my home town.  Not so Via.  In several towns in Maine and Connecticut, I parked in front of rows of old stores that had been there for years.  Punch in  local stores on the difficult to use POI list, and it can't find any of them.  Also, punch in or look for stores like nearest Walmart....Mio and Tom Tom had no problems finding several..or the nearest ones it knew about from your location.  But with Via, it has to be within a certain distance from you..or it will not show up as existing.  So....you then have to figure out the next town and search from that location, to try to find the store.  Very, very clunky....can't tell you how much trouble that is.  It's so simple on the other units, you get spoiled with the Garmin or TomToms.  This one makes it so hard and still can't find the POI's.  No GPS finds all stores....there is a limit on POI's, of course.  But it seems the Via programmers spent their time gathering addresses for BANK ATM's and not restaurants, shopping, etc. Believe me, once you've used it on a trip, it's organized to make you believe the programmers never actually used a GPS themselves before.I can't say enough about how "difficult" the interface is....and when you go "back" or "forward" to another screen, it often loses where it is...and you have to start all over again programming where you are going, going through multiple difficult steps.  When you lose power, again, you start all over. When I bought it, I read some of the negative and positive reviews and thought....how bad can it be?  I thought the complaining people are probably not techie and are complaining for no reason.  WRONG!  The experienced GPS users are the ones that know just how clunky and bad this software interface is compared to the sleek Garmin or Tom Tom interfaces.  Example: On one trip, my daughter began to throw up, and we had to find an emergency medical treatment facility....this clunky interface made it very difficult to locate one. When you are panicked, you want to quickly find the nearest hospital.  This unit makes you put in the town, etc. if you are further than x miles or so...like when you are on the interstate....so you are literally guessing which town to search to find a hospital.  Which is horrible.  I had this happen before and with the Mio, about 3 clicks and BAM you have searched and found the nearest hospital...one more click and you are routed to the nearest hospital.  Truly, I am sad to not recommend the ViaMichelin.  I really recommend you "pass" like some other reviewers have suggested. And I recommend you to buy the more rapid, easy to use Mio with the great screen, blazing fast Sirf 3 and calculating chip, and loud-clear-speaker.  If you are tech challenged, buy the Garmin or TomTom's with their awesome and easy to use software interface.  But don't buy this bad speakered, horrible interfaced, poorly designed, buggy unit.  On paper, it looks like a killer unit. But in reality, it is an unpolished clunky paper tiger that is horrible to use.  Finally, there is the "fun" factor.  The TomTom One is fun.  The Mio is fast and fun, a pleasure to use!  Even the newer Garmin's are fun with their simplicity (I hated the screen on some of the old Garmins.)  But the ViaMichelin X-930 has no fun programmed in....it is not a pleasure to use, although it will take you across country.  Believe me, the pleasure of the low price will quickly fade once you start working with the unhearable speaker, unpolished, unfun, clunky, interface with poorly organized features and disorganized POI's and menus. The polished quick intuitive menu is where Garmin and TomTom shine.  The only thing better on the ViaMichellin is the screen and Sirf-chip...some of the older Garmin's use an older satellite GPS chip than the ViaMichellin, but new tomtom's and Via use the same GPS satellite chip, but faster software routines and cpu chips.  But even the use of the Sirf-3 chip on the Via Michelin, cannot make up for the poor software and menu design. Theoretically, this thing should be blazing fast, but it is much slower than my TomTom or Mio.  The only thing better on this unit than the Mio, is that the Via is smaller and thinner. And maybe the Navteq maps might be slightly better for some locals.  But other than that, the Mio wins hands down, by far a faster, better and easier to use GPS in my opinion.  If you are looking for software ease, go Garmin first, then Tom-Tom, then Mio, and Via last.  If you are looking for value in a great unit then go with the Mio 310x, it's a killer unit and it's hackable.  But if you are looking for simplicity i programming where you are going, go with Garmin first, then Tom-tom. I tried you Mr. ViaMichelin, but you need to go to "finishing school" like the other GPS students.  You are just too unfinished and rough
I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work
The PCI bus does not have the bandwidth to get you Gigabit speed.  You will be very lucky if you can get 300 megabit speeds on a PCI gigabit card, even with jumbo frames.Your motherboard has two PCI busses, and sometimes has three.  Depending on the chipset and the manufacturer, the internal devices like the keyboard/mouse/floppy, internal network, USB, Firewire, and more, will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses.  You will have to run SiSoft Sandra or pcitweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the PCI bandwidth it can get, but that will not be close to gigabit speed, either.  Best case on 33 MHz PCI is 300 megabit.Even if you can find which PCI bus has the fewest bandwidth-consuming devices on it, the 33 MHz PCI busses in all consumer PCs cannot handle the bandwidth of this (or any) gigabit card, anyway.  If you want true gigabit speed get a motherboard that has built-in gigabit or get a motherboard with 66 MHz PCI, PCI-X (not PCI Express), 64-bit PCI, or similar, but you're going to pay lots of money for that.Worse yet that built-in Gigabit interface might still be on a 33 MHz PCI bus and always sharing bandwith, giving you less than 300 megabit speed.  It probably shares with other devices so you have to do your homework
This product costs too much for being such poor quality, I can literally just pull the cord apart bare-handed without using barely any force at all. And after it's torn apart there is no hope of repairing it, no matter how much time, effort, and thought you put into it, it's impossible. I'm pretty sure that it's inability to be repaired is just a marketing ploy so you will buy another. The only good qualities these earphones have is their sound quality, and their comfort. The sound quality sounds a little better than the normal iPOD earphones and you can keep them in your ears for a very long time without your ears getting sore. But if you plan on using these while you're leading a busy, active life, I GUARANTEE that they wont last a week. I heard that these earphones are the best...I found out that they are indeed some of the worst...and sadly I found that out the hard way..
I purchased the Cyberpad 8.5x11 digital Notepad with the expectation that I would be able to digitize my sketches and notes I made at work. Unfortunately the product did not live up to my expectations. The first unit that I received did not function, the usb connection to the pad was defective (the connector would not insert all the way hone). I returned it and received very promptly a new unit which at least functioned. As far as being functional that is another story. I proceed to try to use the it in either using the memory in the pad itself or using it directly connected to the computer. Either way the unit produced images that were useless. The lines that look fine on the paper pad were incomplete or missing in the digital version. Drawing a straight line was impossible even with the help of a straight edge. I let a friend try to use it and he had similar unsatifactory results. Unless this performance is a function of this manufacturer's design, I would say that this is one technology that is not ready for 'Prime Time'
I have never written a review like this before but felt compelled to do so in this case. Those considering purchase of this printer should be aware that the claim that it will work with pict bridge connections is NOT true. I purchased this for my wife thinking that it would be a nice compact simple printer to operate where we could easily print pictures of the grandkids. She and I both have newer Nikon digitals and the pictbridge connection will not work with mine at all. With hers, we can make a connection and, following drections carefully, we can get it to 'energize' the printer but the printer will only print intermittent photos and not of good quality. The printer will not pull the paper though properly. (We have even changed batteries in the camera to no avail and had a tech savvy son-in-law look at it.) I read reviews by others, but feel this printer is simply not reliable. I wanted to share our bad experience with those of you evauating a purchase.In my opinion, Canon should be more forthcoming with claims about interface with other cameras. I'm in the process of trying to return it to Amazon. We're going to buy an HP, which I should have done initially.Thank you
the product seems like a great idea, however, it did not come with attatchments for an i-pod, which is the reason we bought it.  Called the company to get the adapter and now need the mfg part number.  it has just been a hassle
J packs them so poorly that over half of them were shattered beyond repair upon arrival
I've found the BEFSX41 (v2.0) to be very problematic.  With firmware version 1.50.18, some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes, bringing down the entire net.  With the newer firmware version 1.52.10 it fixes this problem, but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server (passthru tcp port 80), making the router totally unusable.  Tech support was friendly and helpful, and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1.50.18 for our websites, and upgrade each time to 1.52.10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking.  So now we upgrade/downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week, and each time we do it brings down our net.I've also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands.  You cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its MAC address.  Instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips.  Also, it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number, even though they map to two different computers.  This makes it impossible, for example, to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time
There is something quite wrong with the Laser Mouse 6000, the shape is not right, it's kind of shallow.  I have to be conscious every time I grab this mouse so that I don't to hit the side buttons.  All in all, terrible
I've rarely had bad experiences with Microsoft mice or keyboards. Usually they tend to have above average design and put thought into the product.They evidently didn't hire the "good" designer to work on this product however as this mouse has 2 glaring faults.#1: The shallow height and shape of the mouse is such that it offers no support for your hand whatsoever. This causes hand strain and inconsistent hand placement as you use it. You never get the feeling that your hand is in "the right position".#2: The side buttons are in brain dead locations. Why this is I have no idea, as other Microsoft models put the left side button right where your thumb would be if you move your thumb up slightly (the way it should be). On this "gaming" mouse the left thumb button is much too far forward causing you to have to practically re-adjust your grip on the mouse just to press it. Couple this with problem #1 and the lack of surface contact with your hand causes the mouse to skew under your hand as you press the button thus turning your player to one side when you didn't intend to. Just what you don't want when throwing a grenade.The right button is sort of click-able with your pinky and is actually the more accessible button, but it feels more due to luck than planning.I have to wonder if they even tested this design with any gamers at all before putting it out on the street.I give it 2 stars because for the attempt at wireless feel with the thin cord, and it looks visually appealing. Calling this a "gaming" mouse however and charging a premium for it is a joke you should spare yourself being the butt of.Rating: Not Recommended
I purchased this printer for it's fast printing speed and long life in toner and drum, but it's really been a let down. The printer has this habit of creasing and wrinkling the paper on the first 2 pages of every print out. So  now I have to send 3 copies of everything I want to the printer, wasting paper and ink. I've tried different kinds of paper, and every troubleshooting option offered to me by the fine folks at Brother, but it continues to do this. I've looked around the Internet, and found this is a common defect in the 5240 and 5250 models. It's really an inconvenience, and now I have to purchase a new printer because it's such a pain. If you love to be frustrated and angered over print quality and paper use, this is the printer for you. Otherwise, avoid at all costs
After purchasing the item in december 2006 it didnt take even a week before the troubles started, it kept freezing after switching it on and took quite long to rebuild the data. At one point, (after two weeks) I lost all my data. Despite downloading the software from the website the problems didnt disappear and i am basically left with a promising player which doesnt even allow me to listen to music without frezing.Since then i am struggling with Creative Technical SUpport team as there is advise given to charge my battery or download the software from the website (which both is not been of much help)This player hasnt been much of use to me yet and I deeply regret having paid 360 USD. I gave it 2 stars because I was able to watch 2 movies while waiting at the airport and travelling, this was quite a pleasure
There are no instructins of anykind or anything with this item, and it says it is also a 5 gig mp3 player, well it comes with no software or anything else. If all u want is speakers to plug in its your bag if u want more forget i
Consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in Samsung DLP televisions.  Cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing.  (As a non-techniocal person I should have no idea what these parts are, but alas, I bought a Samsung DLP)  Expect these to fail within 1-2 years.  Expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan.  That is, if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere.  These parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates.  You should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized.  Many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years, and some more often than that.  The lamp costs approx $150-$250 depending on your model, but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty.  This cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan.  Please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring, and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years.While I was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my DLP, my color wheel failed very early.  I called tech support to report a grinding noise, and was told to "turn it off", wait 15 minutes, and turn it back on like this would fix the problem.  After doing this for a while, the color wheel finally failed, actually shattered!  Now I am out of warranty, and Samsung wants nothing to do with me.  I have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors, and they are both backordered indefinitely!  It has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available.  Samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand.  I have had my TV for 18 months, and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time!I have a 42" Samsung Plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26" CRT.  Both are wonderful products, but Samsung is selling DLP LEMONS and will not stand behind them.  DLP is a great bargain up front, but a maintenance NIGHTMARE!  You will pay in the long run, and by the long run I mean every 2 years.  If you still want to purchase a DLP television, PLEASE BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!  IT WILL SAVE YOU A TON, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CIRCUIT CITY TECH TO FIND PARTS WHICH MAY TAKE MONTHS!  I expect Samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled DLP sector, and focus on their beautiful plasma line.  Expect DLP prices to drop even further, but please...LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP
I would never buy this TV again or a Samsung product for that matter. I obviously purchased a lemon, have had two different service calls to come out and try to fix it with no luck. Samsung initially told me I would get an exchange but then got hung up on and when I called back I was told my two service calls only count as one because they were in a 30 day period. How's that for sound logic. I really like it when it works, but, unfortunately, an important aspect of a TV is that you can expect to turn on when you press the power button.
Specs look good. HDMI 1.3a, 1080p, firmware upgrade over Ethernet, etc. The unit seems to be solid (heavy) and well built.However, Toshiba chose to ship this HD-DVD player with only a composite A/V cable (yellow, red, white RCA jacks) in the box. The best resolution you can get with this cable is 480i, and not even as good as an S-Video connection for that!It is pretty amazing that a high-end consumer electronics device which is advertised for its high-definition capabilities and HDMI 1.3a interface is being shipped without a cable set (component video or HDMI) that actually makes it possible for the customer to connect it to an HDTV. I don't know how much cost savings Toshiba gets out of not including a cable that costs less than $5.Now let's get to the real review:Pros:- One of the best features of this unit is its capability to upscale regular DVDs to 1080p. The upscaling is very high quality. The unit also has various noise reduction options that help with some of the poorly mastered DVDs.- If the weight of the unit is any indication, build quality is high.- It has an Ethernet port for firmware updates (and possible future functionality)Cons:- Very slow boot time. Takes longer to boot than my Windows XP PC.- Especially durimg 1080P HD-DVD playback, the unit gets very hot. Make sure your enclosure/rack is open in the back. There is a somewhat loud fan unit in the back of the player.- This player has no zoom/scaling functions for dealing with non-anomorphic DVDs, so you have to use your TVs scaling function. Kind of  a pain since the image quality suffers when the video has to go through two parallel scalers
As the title, it not worth the money at all even at such a low price. The picture quality is bad, very bad. I'd rather spend this money for other web-cam
I bought a PV-D4744 about a year ago,It worked for a while, now it won't read old disks and, even with brand new disks, the chance ofit being able to read the disk are not good,about 90% of the brand new disks I have triedit won't read. I will never buy another panasonic product again.
i got this and installed it.  it can't read cds or dvds.  it can't write cds.  it can only write dvds
Wouldnt buy from this bunch again. The product was given as a gift. My son took it home first week of January when their Christmas visit was over. Couldnt get the scribing process to work. Was told to contact the manufacturers to fix the problem which he did and they couldnt fix. Then he tried to return via Amazons instructions and after hassling with that was told only the original purchaser could return it and so he asks me to see about it. I am told when I contact antonline that its been to long (january 22nd) to return the merchandise. Most responsible companies extended their return deadlines for Christmas and some dont even have one. Wont do business with manufacturer or Antonline again. Having problems with other amazon merchant returns too and may stop using amazon all together except that I use their credit card alot. Guess that can be changed too
Why would anyone get this type of charger? For about $40, you can get an "isupercharger" that you can plug into the wall, plug into a car lighter, plug into a USB port, or run off of a 9 volt battery. With the 9 volt battery option, you can use your iPod all you want, even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping. It's a small, all-in-one design. I don't want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when I take my iPod along.
Ok so, so i ordered this thing on the 10th and it just arived today (19th) nine days later, of course the last day of there so called "Delivery Estimate" .

I used it once and it charged my ipod only 80% after about four hours.  The next day I tried it again and it simply ceased functioning entirely.  This thing is garbage! 
Egad! Upon receiving this remote control, I found that it requires four AAA batteries. There was no mention of that requirement in the product description! I concur with the other review writer: the control is top heavy, and I would add poorly designed. It's thick at the top and thin at the bottom, making it unwieldy. I will be returning this monstrosity
Although these labels were functional, I was disappointed as the paper is far thinner than for similar labels I had purchased previously, and these tended to tear easily
The product was shipped to me in Moscow. After the first charge, I took it to university where it powered my notebook for two hours. Upon returning home and recharging the device, I discover that it will not turn on anymore. I suspect the battery is charging as the LED indicates this as it is connected to AC power. However, disconnecting it from any power source, it appears that the AC outlet and USB ports no longer function. The device gives no auditory signal or LED message, so I don't know if the built in inverter is out or something else is wrong with it. Either way, I'm left with a dead device that never supported charging from a 45 Watt solar panel anyway. I strongly suggest getting the battery from Tekkeon. Sorry about the bad review, but I had my hopes for this device as well.
I sent it back. The price was right but the caller ID didn't function. When I got in touch with AT, they told me, maybe this phone is not compatible with the other phones in my home. (Stupid Response!) I then asked, why would AT put a phone on the market that's not compatible with my other phones, I didn't get a reply!!! They wanted to send me a replacement. I told them there is no point in doing that, if, the replacement phone was not compatible with my other phones! I guess AMAZON will be sending it back to AT
The cd payer is made of what feels like a cheap plastic.The cassette adapter was broken after 10 seconds of use. So I called Coby. They said I'd have to PAY THEM to send me a replacement! My advice, don't bother buying COBY
I bought this for my 12 year old who so far hasn't been able to get it to play.  (I haven't either)  Before giving up on it, we have to retrievethe directions from his grandmother's house and read them thoroughly.  I'mdisapointed since Coby's have a good reputation
Epson's ink is great but very expensive! I use a continuous flow system for my printer from MIS.  Just Google "MIS" . (Midwest Ink Supply)
The card was defective. Have applied for refund from amazon and have bought another to see if this one works. hopefully won't have to keep doing this too many times... have already wasted a lot of time on this. Pretty frustrating
Its a good accessory for Archos product, I have 604 wifi. Its compatible with generation 4 Archos devices. Pros:1) Good build2) Enough connections to expandcons:1) It very much costly as compare to it utility.2) It comes with charger which should be a part of standard item.3) There could be more cables included in this package like SPDIF, USB Mini cable.4) In this cost it could have a backup battery (extra) that could be part of (built in) the Docking station, so that Archos device can have longer play time. I think Archos has a built in mentality of making as much as money they can, if it is then it would not go a long
I purchased one of these radios before Christmas and it works great.  I decided I wanted another for work, so I ordered  another one.  I recived my radio a couple of days ago and had to send it back because the "preset" weather stations are off the mark and the only thing I can pick up is distorted and garbled.  They sent me a replacement and it too is off station.  At this point, I'm wondering if the first one I got was the exception.  I do NOT reccomend this product unless you just want an am/fm radio, that part works great.This will be my last First Alert purchase unless I can try it out first! 
Don't buy if you plan on printing often...runs out very very fast. 
I do not do much printing, but the ink ran low after a very short time. It did not last as long as it normally does when I purchase it at an office supply store. I wondered if it had dried out
I LOVED this printer!!  The print quality is truly phenomenal!  I had a few issues with paper sizes, too many pieces being fed through, the rear feed slot, same as other reviewers, but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful.  And yes, I am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer, because it is DEAD at the ripe old age of 13 months!  Exactly ONE MONTH after the 1-yr warranty, my printer is "unfixable".  And HP won't do anything for me... after speaking to 8 people on the phone (only one of which I understood fully) and 3 supervisors, they just said that I'm SOL... So, yes, very nice printer, if it lasts
I ordered the unit twice, and twice I received a Carrying Case. not the adapter.  I returned both and ordered direct from Cobra.  When I had called customer support for Amazon the second time, I got connected to India of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong.  I guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says.
I burn about 50 CDs a week in live music trades.  I can tell you from experience that these discs do not last.  After a year or so, they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems.  Any scratches that they have only make it worse.  I recommend using Sony, Fuji, or TDK.  All the others are cheaply made in comparison and just don't stand the test of time.  So if you care about preserving your CDs, don't use these ones
This is not an xD to Compactflash card adapter. If you order this item number, you will receive a PC card adapter that accepts xD picture cards and SmartMedia cards and fits your PCMIA 2.1 slot on a PC or Mac. It is not for a camera or substitute for a Compactflash card. There is nothing compact flash about it. The product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon's website
very very not user friendly.... no instruction to install. worked after it got installed but doesnt work with the wireless internet in my house. Decided to resell it. could be its only because i'm apple-illeterate...
Does not work with non-Apple base stations! I had a PowerMac G5. I was told by Apple retail store clerks it will work any wireless G access points. But No! At my house my PC can see no less than 6 wireless AP's (some from neighbors, one mine). But this Airport card can only see one (which is an Apple Airport Station)! Tried everything ( Googled, set encryption modes,  slow downed my LinkSys WAP tranfering bitrate to 2Mbps etc...) and no luck. Returning it tomorrow
We had troubles fromt he start, they correct a type would not work.  Took to a Brothers repair shop and they could not fix, need some parts.. plus when you tried to type letters you would get numbers...  It was the present my daughter wanted the most for christmas and she could not use... very sad.  So I will by another brand at a local store in town.
This typewriter is an unbelievable piece of junk.  Garbage.  Don't buy it - even if they offer it to you for free. There's not enough room here to list the problems - just skip it.  Do yourself a favor, and stay away from Brother.  I've had nothing but problems with their fax machines and printers as well.  Don't know how they stay in business
soon parted.... very disapointed, bad design, not for the gym which is what I bought them for.. sound is OK, not wonderful... wish I would have read these reviews before I spent the $100.
I am surprised there are not more reviews on how ridiculous the prices are!  I really did enjoy the ease of Tivo from Pre-HD days and wanted to go back from my Comcast HD DVR.  I then saw the pricetag and, unlike the other people... I can NOT justify spending that much money for a DVR!  It is definitely not worth it for something I get for $8 extra a month attached to my cable service.  Yes... i do love the Tivo interface and searching, but I will not pay that much for it.  It feels like business suicide for Tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price.  Knock $700 dollars off that retail price and I might change my mind
A terrific idea: Show the current time AND the alarm times all at once. Very intuitive, very helpful. Unfortunately, the backlit LCD display just doesn't make the grade. The numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable. The manufacturer's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear, but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic. The numbers just wash out.It's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer's image and from the unit I got. I think that would be a slight improvement, because on the one I got, the orange (backlighting the alarm times) is about twice as bright as the green (backlighting the current time), and it just looks weird.Also, FM radio reception is quite poor. The line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna, but that just doesn't work well no matter how I orient the cord. I can't tune in a strong station just 10 miles away. So back it goes
I was very disappointed when I got to South America and went to curl my hair and nothing happened.  Take a look at the product specifications.  It has limited use for appliances between 500 and 1600 watts. I had two different curling irons with me - one was rated 85 watts and the other 125 watts.  I am not sure what appliances this converter was designed for.  Take my recommendation.  Buy the converter by Tumi instead.  It is twice the price, but it is one piece, easy to travel, and works with many different types of appliances. I am very satisfied with it.
This cartrige never printed any color than red. even after cleaning many, many times! Will never buy another cartrige from them. paying twice the price for one that works is a better investment
The radio for the boom box worked.  The CD player did not work.  I had to return it to be repaired or replaced. I do not have it back yet
Most annoying thing is that I hooked up through HDMI for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the HDMI (I used optical). What the hell is the deal with that? At first I thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your TV or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well. HDMI is supposed to make it more convenient, 1 cable etc... why is this necessary??????? Secondly my receiver is not working properly. The sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled 99% of the time. Running the auto MACC fails out, manually I see that it outputs surround right speaker to the front right speaker????? Nothing is hooked up to this output on the receiver so nothing should be outputting at all during this part, surround left is silent as it should be.  Occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out 3 times louder then it supposed to be.  Adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm. If I select the different output options, basically pushing buttons for no reason sometimes the audio will be correct and does sound amazing. I am current in process to return my faulty receiver for a replacement as I do think the receiver is nice if its working, I enjoy the IPOD dock that has output to your tv as well.I major concern is something is wrong with there HDMI circuitry and causing my problems and the replacement will be bad as well. I will update when I get the replacement installed.
I bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system.  I based my decision on information as stated on the Pioneer web site, and the attractive price compared to some of the other options I considered.This receiver does have a number of good features, but has one serious flaw.  It will not display on screen status messages for daily operations, like volume and sound mode, unless you have a Pioneer display, and run another special cable from the receiver to the TV (As a side note, Pioneer needs to understand we want to run LESS cables to our display).  That means you only get to see the simple set-up screen on your non-Pioneer TV, which you will probably use when you first set up the receiver, and very infrequently after that.  (The set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs, and audio calibtraion.)Sounds like a small deal, but in many home theaters, including mine, the electronics are not in the line of site (mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything.)  This not uncommon, many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors, and it means I have no idea what the volume is, what sound mode I am using, or anything beyond the set-up menu unless I go into the closet. BAD, BAD, BAD!  This seems to be a marketing ploy by Pioneer to get you to buy Pioneer TV's and projectors, and it is beyond stupid.  If this was not the case I would rate this receiver much higher, but it is a SERIOUS flaw.  It makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult.This limitation also means, if you have mulitple displays, I have a plasma TV and projector in my theater, you need to run thier special cable to both displays, and both have to be Pioneer.  Again, I have to say BAD, BAD, BAD!The other features are as stated on the Pioneer website, but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display, and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the receiver in the line of site when using thier systems, unless they have a Pioneer display with SR+.  (Oh yeah, your Pioneer display has to be also be equipped with SR+, thier way of linking the two units.  If your Pioneer display is not equipped with SR+, you are again out of luck.  Did I mention this is BAD?!)25 Feb 2007 - addition to reveiw:I called Onecall and they will take unit back, but at 15% restocking fee, plus paying for shipping both ways.  While Onecall really did nothing wrong (Pioneer is lying about the OSD!), it is one of thier vendors and not the customer's fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud.  Buyer beware from Onecall, thier customer service on this one was not good
Wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the IOGEAR GIC251U 5-port USB card on a Dell Optiplex GX-1 running 98SE. (This computer already has 2 USB 1.1 ports.) The main problem is that the Add Hardware Wizard does not find a *.inf file in the IOGEAR-supplied CD folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the CD folder. User has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand-alone program. This results in installation of drivers that show up in the Device Manager. However, the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going.Installed card seemed to work OK for a D-Link wireless adapter, but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non-IOGEAR 1.1 ports. The following actions did not help. (1) swapping the card to another PCI slot, (2) downloading and installing more recent driver file from IOGEAR website, (3) three calls to customer support, where I found sympathy but so solution
manual and I cannot find that it supports SACD
The Sony MDR-IF3000 headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear.  Perhaps, if one were an elf or a small child, they would fit properly; however, if you're like me, a mere adult mortal, they probably won't fit you.  They would be okay for simple stereo listening, but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description.  If you're looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie, the SONY MDR-IF8000 are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money
This is a piece of junk. The radio reception is terrible. FM is marginal and AM is almost nonexistent.
The unit was 20ft from the receiver, in the same room, in direct view of eachother...Tivo wouldn't connect
I have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to Windows Vista.  As a result of the Windows upgrade, this product just lost half its value for me.  The drive works fine physically, but the included backup software will not work with Vista when I try to schedule an overnight backup; the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling.  As others have noticed here, Western Digital offers ZERO support for its software - I cannot even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem
when I went to use this product i didn't even have it  for a day and the antenna broke
product came broken  now your out of stock,  and i do not have that credit card anymore.so now what. i would like my money back. address 2655 forest blvd. jax, fl.3224
The seam came apart and the gel leaked out in the first 6 months. The non-skid, underside surface has a peculiar and distinctly unpleasant smell
I purchased this cable as a replacement, and it is far worse than the original I had.  There is noticable shadow distortion. My advice is to buy a higher quality cable w/ ferriete beads. This cable was not useable
I've been using this remote since it was released.  Better than any others I've run into, but when it gets a glitch which all software driven devices are susceptible too, be prepared to give up a couple of hours.When it's working, it's a 5 Star device, however...read on as to why I give it a 2.As I type this, my hold time is up to 45 minutes on the phone to 2nd level support.  3rd call today.I simply got a new PVR.  Programmed OK, but it isn't the default device when I watch TV.  Also, it took two calls to find out my DirecTV PVR is not a PVR, it's a "satellite".  As a "PVR", it couldn't be added to Activities because "you don't have a device that will change channels".  News to me.  Never known a PVR that couldn't change channels.Literally, 4 friggin' hours so far and it still not right.At some point, the TV suddenly stopped turning on.  2-3 hours on that issue and it's still not right.  TV does not go on until I hit the "Help" button on the remote.To add insult to injury, I can't access the website.  Enter my email as an ID and am told it's already in the database.  I ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized.I hate that the software doesn't have a simple "Home" button.  You have to go through several menus to get back to it. Hold time now up to 52 minutes.  I have to hang up for an appt., so the hold has to be repeated....AGAIN. Oh yeah...I also dislike the size of the buttons, especially the numbers. Cell phone sized. No doubt designed for a dainty child. I could go on, but if another comes out with a product like this one, I'll be looking hard at it
Issue solved!  I returned the Harmony for a full refund.  All thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team.  After screwing up everything on Christmas day (it was a Christmas present)), your support staff said "level 2" would contact me within 24 hours.After waiting 72 hours, I called "support" again yesterday.  After waiting 30 minutes, I finally got to speak with a real-live agent who "could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor's approval."  This was after providing the incident number.  That took another 15 minutes.  I then waited another 30 minutes (total now 1:15) before I had to leave.I tried again several hours later.  After being told "level 2 was not available."  I hung up and immediately returned my Harmony to ....Thanks, Logitech.  -Keit
Horrible - the first time I slid my nano into the case it put several scratches on the front; defeats the purpose for even buying it. I would recommend getting an Agent 18 case.
This unit will not fit all lighter sockets.  I've been unable to get the unit to work at all in my wife's Saab 9-3.  The 33185 version does fit
I have the same criticisms as many others.  I had to put on rubber gloves to open the battery compartment.  After turning it off after the first use, I couldn't get it turned back on again and returned it to the store.  I loved the size, but I bought a nice wireless by Microsoft; not a mini, but easy to use, a battery compartment that opens without difficulty, and a nifty little snap-in receiver that turns the mouse off automatically.  Take it out, put it in the usb port and the mouse is back on again.  Price was comparable, even though I pay a lot more for these items, living in the Caribbean.  Amazon does not ship anything but books, cd's and dvd's to the Caribbean
if you can make it work or if you are lucky to get a non defective unit:it can only read 1 card at a timeneeds specific usb power requirements (needs the usb power be +5v and not +5vsb) else you will get "USB hub power exceeded errors" the worst part is that the mainboard i tested is +5v... and still didn't workthe cards inserted on the lower card slots have to be inserted upside downfrom time to time you can get the message usb device not recognized...contacted support... service there = average/not so good (support forum has several topics complaining about this product)couldn't get a replacement since 30 days tigerdirect warranty have expired, can't send the unit to ultra because currently I'm outside the US and as i stated customer service is not good.bottom linedon't buy this item
The Sennheiser PMX70 had excellent sound quality and volume compared with others I'd used recently. I had high hopes on first listen. However, these semi-in ear headphones were moderately uncomfortable after only about 20 minutes. I later took them on a 40 minute run. The design is such that in any position I adjusted them, the speakers tilted slightly upward in my ear. Once I started perspiring, my sweat poured right into the little speakers. I had to stop every few minutes to shake the collected sweat out of the earpieces. The right speaker was filled with sweat and non-functional pretty much the entire run. Who designed these? Consider these headphones only if you 1) never plan to exercise while using them and 2) will be keeping them on for 20 minutes or less
I bought a Netgear WG311T wireless card to replace one from another manufacturer that had failed.  First, I coudln't get a connection to the router.  Two conversations with tech support in India produced the information that I had to download a new driver for Windows XP-SP2 from the internet.  I installed the new driver, which allowed me to connect to the router, but not reliably to the internet.  A third attempt with tech support produced the suggestion that I change my web browser (I'm using IE!)  Instead, I bought a Linksys card, which worked straight out of the box.  Don't buy this product!  If you're not convinced, go to the Netgear user forum and read the horror stories there
I bought this hoping it would cure my busted Superdrive on my G4 iMac but when connected via the Firewire it would freeze any program I was using to burn cd's or dvd's.  I thought it might have been a messed up product so I returned it to Lacie and got another one but the problem still persisted.  I then thought it was my computer, but the firewire ports worked when connected to my old iPod and even worked when connected to my Lacie external HDD.  Finally figured that the product was defective after I purchased the Sony DRX-830 dvd burner and that burner worked perfectly when connected via firewire.  This product however worked when connected on the USB port but the burning speeds were so slow that it was just about useless
Everything is fine and dandy except the fact that it doesn't come with the USB cord to hook the printer to the computer, and that IS a LITTLE important.  Also, I have Windows Vista, and the printer is not compatible with it, I have to download a patch, but that was my own fault.  I guess you get what you pay for..
This unit satisfies in its GPS functionality, but is problematic elsewhere.  When I decided to purchase a GPS, I decided to spend the extra money and get a integrated handsfree bluetooth unit for my phone (Motorola RAZR V3).  The bluetooth connection was easy to set up and reliably would find my phone and connect.  Unfortunately, the bluetooth connection would disconnect after about five minutes, even though the 6000T would still show the unit and phone as connected.  Customer service was no help.... it seems their script only includes the instructions "download the latest software" (I already had) and "reset the unit" (didn't help).  Second problem:  the unit started turning itself off randomly (actually, it went into "Sleep Mode") while driving down the road.  The customer service response?  You are correct.... "download the latest software" (I already had) and "reset the unit" (didn't help).  I finally complained loudly enough that they told me to send the unit in for repair (at my expense, of course).  I received it back and the bluetooth feature was not repaired.  Their solution for the unit randomly going into Sleep Mode?  They turned off the power management so the unit would not go into Sleep Mode under any circumstance.  Well, I suppose that IS a solution, but a pretty crappy one since, if you forget to power down the unit manually when you leave the vehicle, the GPS battery will be totally drained when you get back in the car.I expected MUCH better at this price point.  Shoulda gone with Garmin
First few weeks it worked, and now we really needed it when driving in remotes areas, 3 hrs away from home through a snowstorm.......it gave up working and we never were able to turn it on again,.......we didnot take  a map,as  we were sure with this navigation system we would be safe..however we felt pretty unsafe and lostvery frustrating and we are very disappointed with this recently EXPENSIVE Magellan navigation system, and with Amazon as a usually depending sourc
I bought this because I wanted an encrypted device that I could use to offload personal documents I receive while traveling for work, and then read them using my Mac(s) at home.  Lexar JD II is the only product I found advertised to work with both Macs and PCs at the same time.  My primary Mac is an Intel Mac.  Early on I realized the encryption utility only runs on PPC Macs.  Okay, so I figured I'd use it on the PPC Mac Mini, and everything seeemed fine at first.   Then I hit a problem where my Mac Mini could not read video DVDs.  A little search on the Mac support forums, and I found that installing Lexar JD software disables video DVD support on my Mac!  Fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall.Aside from the problems with the Macs, I also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned, which is that you must be logged in as a LOCAL administrator to use the encryption software under Windows.  Since my work PC is a member of a domain, I had to create a local account, log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway. Kingston Data Traveler Elite works fine under Windows domain logins, unfortunately for me they don't have Mac software yet.  So in summary the current Lexar encryption software:- Can't be used on a Windows domain machine- Can't be used on an Intel Mac- Breaks the DVD on a PPC MacIt's not for me!However if you are using the Lexar strictly on stand-alone Windows PCs, OR you don't require encryption, it should be okay.
Not at all what I wanted.  It is a plastic slip on that pushes the buttons when you don't want them pushed.  Ordered 2 and plan to return them.  I usually don't even bother to write a bad review; I just don't write one, but in this case I'll make an exception.  Yuk!  Actually, I rate it at a "0" but there was no "0" selection.
In my opinion: I own a ton of Panasonic equipment, most recently a DVD recorder. I was using Sony DVD-Rs with no problems, but, being a Panasonic person, I figured Panasonic must be better. In order to save a few bucks, I joined the Panasonic Club at the Panasonic website, and ordered a spindle of these same type DVD-Rs. I did this on 9/20/06. I made several phone calls and emails to find out where my discs were, and, believe it or not, nobody at Panasonic could tell me why they hadn't been shipped. Then, I was promised that they did ship, but I never got them. After being talked into placing a duplicate order by a Panasonic Rep, I didn't get that order either. I finally received one order on 10/16/06. They were so poorly packaged that the holder was broken. Now, I finally had my discs. Guess what? They were only 1-8x speed (the Sony discs were 1-16x speed), and my thermal label printer wouldn't print on them because of the finish. I had been assured that I could print on them with a thermal printer. I did burn a couple of movies, and they worked, but I saw nothing special that I can report. It gets worse: I logged into my Panasonic Club account, and saw two charges I hadn't made: one for $10,017 and one for $915. I fell off the back of my chair. To this day nobody has called me, but I managed to get some email responses, and I was told I would have to watch my credit card - that's just what I need! You know, sometimes you buy a brand and think great things about how wonderful a Company it is, and then one day you have some dealings and realize how wrong you were. I'm going back to Sony, and let me tell you, Amazon Customer Service blows away just about every company I've dealt with (sorry about the preposition). I should have bought on Amazon. 
I am glad I purchased my Cardscan 700, but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all.  My impression is that this is the best product on the market, due to its scanning properties, which are quite good.  There are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed, and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless, since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place.PROs: It does a pretty good job of scanning.  The algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive.  Even cards that catch and rotate as they go through, producing a funny smeared image, have some of their contents scanned correctly.  The superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product.  There is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards.  Operationally the product is especially nice- I can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one, glancing at the screen to catch errors.  The card image is retained in the record in the Cardscan database, which is important. CONs: 1) the exit path has places that cards can hang up, and they can catch as they go through.  This happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat, so part of the operation is to try to prevent that, by straightening out bent corners ahead of time, and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck.  Quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous, this wouldn't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case.  2) Although the product retains the image of the business card, there's no way to pass that through to Outlook or export it to any other format.  This is very unfortunate.  I could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one, except that Cardscan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image.  Why not?  It's easy to implement.  3) Every time I start the program it harasses me about registering, even though I've been specific that I do not wish to.  It also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though I've asked it not to do that.  It therefore ignores the user wishes.  4) The data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file, in a simple text or csv format.  There is no way to create an Outlook format .pst file, which would simplify importing, and allow for the future option of including an image.  Outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record, but apparently Cardscan folks aren't even close to thinking about this.  5) If I indicate that a data export for a file is destined for Outlook, the field names are not set up correctly, so unless I do some heavy editing of field names, nothing much other than the contact name gets across.  If I export directly to the running Outlook program, it isn't perfect, but it's close enough to be usable.  Why did Cardscan get one right and not the other??  In neither case can I send the card image over.  6) I was forced to install Microsoft .NET software even though I intended to do all my exports via files.  I didn't get a choice- if I didn't install .NET, the installer stopped and exited without installing any Cardscan software.
This is a cheap cable in both cost and quality. When connected between my Voodoo3 3000 card and my Mag Innovision DX17F monitor, the picture quality was poor, with severe ghosting of the screen.  This cable does not have the cylinders on each end as most monitor cables do.  I assume the  lack of these cylinders is what causes the degradation in signal quality
We've been through 2 generations of this phone and they suck. Why we gave them a second chance I don't know. The buttons that get used the most stop functioning after about a couple of years. Then it's off to the landfill. I am FED UP with this trend in products to stop working after a limited amount of time. So long Motorola
My first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my HP Deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing. I replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all. While repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested, the etch tore. When examing the inside of the printer, I found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage.  The next new cartridge would not work either. $$ wasted.  Tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure (after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out). Printer repair would cost me more a new one
Beware -- this unit does not work with Toshiba laptops.   Tech support is non-existent.   You will never get through on the phone.   Email support is non-existent.   You will have to wait weeks to hear back.  If it does work with your laptop, this unit does a great job of recording and playing. 
These speakers are big in size but short on performance.  Except for the price tag, not much else excites one about them.  They make a good surround sound system with the Sony 3 speaker set for surround sound, but for listening to music you are better off with a set of good bookshelf speakers with a decent sub.  These speakers lack bass inspite of their size, and sound quality is poor at higher volumes
I found this paper on Amazon as an accessory to the Olympus Camedia P-400 Printer.  This paper does NOT fit the P-400 because this paper is TOO wide.  Thus, with the P-400, this paper is useless
Item is advertised as working with all rino series but it does not work with the rino 53
Please be aware of an important issue with this cable, even though it is recommended for the eTrex GPS series it will not fit their flat 4 pin connector.I had to return mine and bought one at the local REI
This was terrible. I returned after hours with tech support and days of email exchanges with Apple Support Desk. The product will probably be better with future software updates, but in my experience, it was fairly unreliable in its current state. Examples of problems: wouldn't download drm managed content online, had problems when downloading itunes purchased music (the first time I've had that problem in 4 years of ipods and itunes), couldn't connect to my corporate VPN, and finally, just as evidence of the lack of QA on this device, the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the Apple Extreme. The images were of the previous white, button-shaped device.This was a genuine disappointment, and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad QA.  Others seem to have had more success, but I'm back on my 802.11g airport extreme and all problems have magically disappeared
I spent two days tried to have it formatted by my Powerbook G4 and set up a wireless network to replace my Microsoft wireless router.  No luck.  It is on the shelf ever since. People at the Genius Bar in local apple store may be able to help but it is too much troubel.To set up other routers with a PC you can easily hire some one to set it up for you at your home for a couple of hundred dollars.  Not Apple.  If you don't have time don't buy this product. 
I got this for christmas 2004.  Played 5 DVD's on it and started to get the No Disk reading.  I only had it for 1 month.  I sent it back and they are replacing it since it is under warranty but they are replacing it with a different model.  We will see if it has the same problems.  According to reviews of the 1700m model I expect the same.  I suggest you spend a little more money and get a better DVD Player
I bought my wife a Nuvi 350 for her birthday last August (overall, we love the Nuvi, but the mount...no). The biggest "advantage" of the Nuvi over other GPS systems is its portability. Unfortunately, the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. The cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it). What this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in. The mount and the charging/power wire (which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount) are pretty darn expensive ($60-70) which is ridiculous for a "portable" system
I do not think suction cup mounts work very well.  This one is no exception.  While attaching and detaching my Garmin Nuvii is easy enough, the cup does not support the weight.  I was disappointed that a Friction bag was not available for my Nuvii.  However, I was able to Jury-rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise.  I ordered the Friction mount, removed the screws on the bottom, detaching the mounts that would not fit my Nuvii, and stapled velcro strips purchased at Walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount.  I have been cross country using this system and it works.  the Garmin Portable Friction Mount for GPS 010-10306-00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself
I called Garmin tech support yesterday (10/17), did wait about 15 minutes to speak to someone.  I called in the morning so it wasn't a long wait.  Since my nuvi is still under warranty (1 year warranty) I requested a RMA for a replacement suction cup mount.  The tech asked how it had failed -- mine also had melted to the windshield so I had to rip it off -- and responded like he was very familiar with the problem.  He also mentioned the rubber material of the original design was defective and that they had a new rubber material design and would send me a new one.  I didn't have to pay for it and should get here in 7-10 days
The item is good, the sound is decent but i tought than a refurbished item was an item that you can hardly say it's used. The speakers i got did not look good at all. Scrached and dirty, you can see it was used for a very long time. No too happy about this item
When it works it does extend the range. However, every time you turn off a wirelessly connected PC and turn it on again, the PC is not assigned an IP number. Unplug this extender, and the PC is assigned an IP number by the router without any problem. A brief power blackout will cut IP numbers to your wirelessly-connected PCs. I purchased this particular D-link range extender because I wanted to ensure that it works well with my DI-624 router. I wasted my money buying this device. It's useless, and it's too light to even serve as a door stop..
I have the luxury of writing this review a little bit further out in the technology cycle than most of the others, so I can say:  Just get yourself a better wireless router.Based on the reviews here, several online fora, and my own personal experience, I can confirm to you that you have about a 30% chance of actually getting this to work, and you might get that percentage up a little bit if you keep returning defective ones and trying another.  But why bother?At this point, there are higher-power routers, high-gain directional antennae, and there are even products sporting 802.11n, which inherently has a better range that -a, -b, or -g.If you've gotten into a situation where your router is inadequate for your needs, research and get yourself a top-notch router with good broadcast power--I would strongly recommend against trying to remedy an inadequate router by trying to add this product to your network.I understand that my suggestion may be more expensive, but I am seriously saying that you will avoid wasting any more than necesary of the precious remainder of your time on this earth.  Definitely hours (if, by some miracle, everything works on the 12th or 13th try), and probably a couple of days (assuming that after 24 or 25 tries you send back the first one and try again with a new one)
This device is much bulkier than it needs to be. But an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod. The ipod plugs in to the back, and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod. It is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit; then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too
Other than the power switch is not easy to see, the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality  not that good.  Use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you.  Even using it for church meeting recording, you would not get excited for its sound quality.If you can tolerate the size of Sony ECM-MS907, you may like the sound quality of that microphone. If you like a small lapel microphone with true voice, try the AKG WMS-40 wireless system.  Our people are much happier with the AKG wireless microphone than this one.
Why not sell the thing with a battery, it's a special battery, not available in the boonies, so I have a choice....Drive 30 miles or wait another week for a battery to come in the mail.  Iknow, Iknow in the text it does say battery not included but who reads that?  So for the folks who read this... BUY A BATTERY TOO!!!
It wasn't clear from the packaging that this doesn't work with the newer iPods with video.  I had to search the internet (after I already purchased and could see that it clearly didn't fit) to find this information
The thing wouldn't even fit around my handle bar; I had to zip-tie it on.  A waste of $$. 
I've owned the new V.3 product for over a week and have still not been able to unlock it for use. Customer service is worse than I've ever experienced. They won't commit to calling me back and have suggested that someone will be working on the problem and I should continue to keep trying the unlock process until it works.
I truely wish I had found the prior reviews for this product before I bought it. Unfortunately, I am now stuck with a product that will not start and will not run on my pc, running WinXP2!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Support sucks all around and there appears to be no fix now or in the near future to get software working...I lost $100 bucks on this one!!
I've had this scanner for 6 months now.  It worked OK the first month, but since then it loves to "eat" paper. It scans multiple pages at once.  For example, a 20 page document, becomes 15 pages one scanned.  I have to scan the same document multiple times (sometimes up to 12 times) until the scanner finaly scans each page. It gets to be very frustrating, actually, it's the worse piece of office equipment I ever purchased. Otherwise it works fine
The "LP-to-Digital Recording system" is nothing more than a record player. Just a vanilla, run-of-the-mill record player. You still need a sound card in order to record your LPs. Most builtin (on the motherboard) sound cards have very poor audio input, so this product is not suited to its advertized function.I am reminded of the "solar clothes dryer" product of a couple of years back - the box contained a rope and some clothespins.The software is awkward and hard to use, not at all intuitive. It also requires the user to register on the net and donate their privacy. Any buyer would be better off getting Audacity (freely available on the net), which is easy to use and has the same features.I do not recommend this product.
This Linksys stuff simply doesn't work. And don't try getting technical support - it's a complete waste of time. If you can't Google the solution, just take the stuff back.The adapter install took out my TCPIP stack, even for my WIRED connection. It took me 3 full days to figure out that I needed to remove any sign of Linksys, Odyssey, and Funk Software from the registry, then remove and reinstall the TCPIP stack. Linksys support couldn't even get me a promised registry cleaner after 28 days, a dozen emails, and 5 separate phone calls.Linksys support is just embarrassing. Don't be caught having to depend on it
I have purchased the card for my 3 years old Toshiba laptop, which has a wireless card (b) so I thought it is time to go faster. I have connected to various access points with it,but for the first  week I could not get it to connect to internet, so it would see the networks but it would not connect at all. After installing the latest driver i connected to internet, however even it shows a stronger signal than my laptop's card it is very very slow.Plus, it did not see some of the networks, which i could see with my laptop's card. The Tech. guys have been very kind , but their advice did not help.I am very disappointed.
My title is my review. The thing worked for a week. After that it wouldn't power up anymore. Chinese junk
I purchased this cable and the pins were weak and clumsy.  I could not even plug it in and one of the pins broke.  I threw it away.  It is a piece of junk
I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work
I had the TX-SR304.  Everything sounded great.  However, certain times when I played my DVD, the Onyko produced a loud high-pitched ear-piercing sound.  Sounds almost like a record scratching.  The most common times it made this sound was during the DVD menu, when it replays the music theme.  The receiver would transition from Dolby Digital to stereo then back to DD again, then making that loud sound. Everything was great, but this one problem made me return this item, which is a bummer because I would have kept it otherwise
Amazon was great about shipping this product, but I eventually returned it due to several problems.  They were also great about the return -- they paid the return shipping and I got a full refund.I never tried any recordings with this card using the Media Center software that is part of Windows MCE. I was using it with SnapStream BeyondTV 4.1. If you record using anything but the Best (DVD 720x480) quality level it would crop out part of the picture. This is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue. The latest Hauppauge driver did not solve the problem. The other problem I had is that several times when I was recording two programs at the same time, one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it. I don't know if this was a problem with the card or BeyondTV, but I think it's probably due to the card. I don't know if I had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards. I also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured. I have Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other PCs, and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card. After reading some reviews, it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also (and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card). BeyondTV works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above; but I also only have one tuner card in the PCs that I use these cards in, so I can't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using BeyondTV. I returned the 500 card, and I instead purchased two VisionTek Xtasy Theater 550 Pro cards. Thus far I'm not having any of the issues with them in BeyondTV that I was having with the Hauppauge 500 card -- I can record at a lower quality level with no cropping, and I've had no audio issues so far. The quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card (although maybe not as good as that captured by the Hauppauge 250 and 350 cards).
I bought this hub less than 2 months ago.  It has stopped working!  If I plug it in, it is no longer powered.DO NOT BUY THIS P.O.S.!
This phone stopped working just right after I threw all the packing material away.  Horrible, horrible static.  Non user friendly buttons as well.  I wish I could have returned it.  Do not buy this phone
The sound quality is fine if you are in range.  The dual headsets work as advertised, in other words:1.  You cannot talk on both phones at the same time (instead, you can transfer a call to the other phone).2.  The range is not great (though I have no complaints with the sound quality when in range of about 30 ft)3.  The voicemail alert system sometimes indicates voicemail even though you have none.Other than that, it's a phone that only needs one phone cord and works for a small household
Make sure you know that these will work with your camcorder before buying. Apparently, they work fine with Sony camcorders (the packet too says so) but not with Canon. Also, it's incompatible with my new Panasonic camcorder too. Interestingly, it was displayed as a combo offer when I bought my Panasonic camcorder, which is the reason why I bought it anyway, but got duped
These discs do not work with my Canon Camcorder. I think the label should inform people they may not be compatible with certain devices
When outsite temperature is around 0 Celsius degrees or below, and the car and the unit it's not yet warm enough the detector acts very strange, it gives sudden false alarm like K 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 55 5  0 0  0 , Ku alarm 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 in spots where when it has normal temperature gives no alarm. And sometimes when on the highway , from nothing it gives a sudden alarm of strength 5 5 55 5 and then nothing my old cobra had no strange alarms like this one and it was smaller . the spiral coil it's not good to short , you need a straight one maybe the scale would be better if it was from 0 to 9
tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper.i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you.but if you wanna save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality
Switch did not work with my Samsung 191T monitor. Customer service people were slow to respond and were not helpful
The Apple Remote is included with the iMac G5 and works great with it and Front Row.  However, for the iPod, it's almost useless.  The lack of menu navigation capability using the remote is crippling.  In short, don't buy this remote, look at other non-Apple remotes that are more full-featured
This antenna is too directional dependent. Almost always I have to re-adjust its orientation to obtain better reception on any one channel. In addition, if you live in an apartment very close to or surrounded by adjacent apartment blocks, forget about this antenna. Given most of the previous reviews, it will probably work okay if you live in small buildings
I've had my Micro for over a year now, and when it worked, I loved it! However, I'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue; the sound is output in layers, and I am constantly trying to "reposition" my headphones to get full sound. My husband called Creative Labs for assistance, and he was told that it would cost him [...] per month for a "customer service subscription." After reading these reviews, it seems we'd be paying Creative Labs [...] so that they could tell us there's nothing they can (or will) do. Next brand, please... 
7 out of the 25 disks would not write.  I didnt much care for the product considering this factor. 
I cannot speak for all devices, but this was a total failure in my case.  I am a fast typist, and it seemed that about 20% of the keystrokes were not picked up by my Treo 270.  This was simply unacceptable, so I immediately returned it.  I cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard, the software, or my old PDA.  Newer, faster PDAs might have a better success rate, but the potential for problems will still be there.  My suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your PDA
Pros: CheapCons: Bad video quality. Moving diagonal lines are clearly visible
Purchased Cobra 75 WX ST All-in-handset Mobile CB about 1 year ago. Easy installation, up-front controls, very convenient. Six months after installation speaker in mike failed, could only get sound through external speaker, using external jack. Repair shop said it would cost almost as much to fix as the unit cost. 
I purchased this mouse 5 months ago and it has been total frustration ever since. The buttons on the sides are not easy to access or use. But most frustrating is the way the two main buttons perform. When I clicked on them they end up double clicking which caused a lot of problems with retrieving my email messages. I know some may be thinking I haven't configured the settings correctly but I went over it several times and couldn't get it to work right.  What's even more frustrating is the support at Razer is non-existent. They never responded to my email questions which I submitted several times before giving up. I ended up buying a Wacom Intuos 3 tablet which works amazingly well and gives me so much more. I am a commercial illustrator so it is the perfect mouse/pen tool for my needs. Don't buy this product. I would have given it a negative 5 stars if that were an option. At $43.65, it's a steep price to pay for the frustration and a complete waste of time and money
I use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the GPS-360 device further down the dashboard. This adapter apparently can't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle. I've only used it twice - first time, it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half. The connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable, but I'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again. I don't want the connector to snap off next
This cable looks nice, when you don't linger on a digital channel.  What happens to me is that if I leave the TV on a digital channel overnight, the next day it will be a split screen mode, showing double image of the broadcast.  To fix it, I have to change it to a non-digital channel and switch it back.  I guess it is possible that it is the cable box, but nothing happens like that on the Component outputs
Returned it.  Wouldn't work with Vista and a Canon MP780 and it certainly won't work with Mac OS X clients (note: the product doesn't advertise support for Mac).Why is it so difficult for manufacturers to create a wireless print server that works with multifunction printers
True to its name it has high sensitivity. Too much that on a very smooth surface this mouse becomes live.Start moving in all directions.On my couch the mouse is dead.If the surface is smooth the mouse laser is too sensitive.But when the surface is soft or rough the mouse gets stuck. The paws/foot of the mouse is sticky.Not sure if this is a defective but really hate this mouse....I am returning this product.Even at the slowest speed it is difficult to click a checkbox on the screen.
[...]The mouse is larger than needed and lighter than the average mouse.  I have dual screens and need an extra accurate mouse.  This is NOT it.  Unfortunately with this one, the sensor doesn't stand still.  My screensaver hardly ever turns on because when the mouse is just sitting there, the arrow jumps in all directions about 2-3 arrow spaces around.  Don't be fulled by the laser technology in this particular mouse.  My old optical was better. 
I've had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light. So I was happy to find this one. However, with my first "Eagle" the alarm didn't go off. Amazon was great about the exchange for a new one (kudos). My repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight won't light up and I have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on. I second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle. The loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning, but I put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough.
This phone would not charge for us - we had to send it back for a refund
I have this setup with my new laptop that runs Vista premium.  The device installs ok and it works with media center.  It's great for watching tv, but if you have scheduled recordings and you like to have your machine be in "standby" mode until it's time to record, you may be disappointed.When coming out of standby, sometimes the tuner is recognized and at other times it is not. When it's not recognized, I have to unplug and then replug the device in order for it to be recognized.Because of this, I have missed several recordings.I contacted pinnacle support and their recommendation was not to use standby. 
Why pay $46.75 for this battery when you can get the same thing made by another manufacturer (Impact) for only $19.95 at B Photo and Video. I have both the the DL-150 Pentax Battery that came with the camera and the Impact IMDL150. I can't tell any difference between them other than the price. Camera makers make a hugh profit on propritory items that can be obtained elsewhere at much lower prices. 
Bought this product to stream HD media from PC/USB Storage. All though advertised on the box and website  it does not play the HD media. I tried to play the media from all 3 available inputs (802.11(wireless), Ethernet, and USB HD) and several formats that are supported (avi,mpeg2,ts,mp4). The HD movies were choppy at best. Plays all other non HD videos without a problem. Divx videos as well(even though it doesn't say it plays them on the box). Worked well with 500GB USB Drive but not needed. Would not recommend because HD feature is useless. Dlink technical support said to take it back to the store. There technical support grade is D- .
The new iPods do not have the connections to work with FireWire. So this cable will only charge the new iPods with video. Besides this this is a good product for the iPods
I purchased this from Amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included.  However when it arrived, there was no battery.  Upon questioning Amazon about the battery, the customer service rep said he could give me a $5 credit for the batteries.  I asked how the battery could only be worth $5.  He said that is what AA rechargeable batteries go for. The bag is ok, but don't order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers
after few months it just stopped working.also, it is not rechargable, and need to replace batery every 1-2 week
Computer Brain sent the wrong product right before Xmas so the present that I intended had to be shipped back and it is Jan. 16 and I am still awaiting the right one. So I don't even know what the product is actually like yet
Purchased thinking it was gold-plated as advertised but actually is not.  Quite noisy - settled for a Monster Stereo (Male-to-Male) cable instead
I love the idea of this product, and I loved working with it. I created a great layout that looked fabulous on screen.  But unless you have an Epson printer, it is very difficult to print out a great copy.  My hp deskjet could not handle the supplied photo paper, so a friend printed on his Lexmark for me. It worked better, but still had a few problems.  More paper should be included in the package in case of printing problems because after several printing problems, we ran out of paper and I could not find the same photo paper in any store; I ended up buying a second package just to get more of the same paper.Next time, I will make a book using the ofoto site -- much more professional looking (2-sided) and just as cheap
I bought this cable to connect 50" Plasma TV to computer. When we connected the cable with TV we could not get it to display computer screen. We spent 2 hours with Plasma manufacturer on telephone troubleshooting the connection. At the end, at our dissapointment, we found out that the cable was defective. When we tried different cable everything worked
Functionally, the iFM is great. I like to use it for workouts at the gym to watch FM transmitted TV's. However, the construction is extremely cheap. I bought two of them and both fell apart. One fell apart the second time I used it. The construction is so cheap that I couldn't put it back together because the controls don't line up. I wish there was an alternative but I can't find one. I like being able to switch between iPod tunes and FM, but will have to carry two devices from now on
I just received the printer. In trying to set it up, I realized there is no computer to printer cable included, nor any explanation  of what kind you need. You have to bail out of the setup and solve that little dilema
Price reflects quality.  Poor sound quality, NO features, not that easy to use.  Don't waste your mone
When I first got this camera, I was satisfied.  It is complicated to use (definitely not intuitive) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want.  However, it took pretty good pictures.  However, soon after the warranty expired, it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn't stop it from doing that.  We tried to contact Fuji but have gotten no response.  My wife found that this is a common problem (overeposure and lack of response from Fuji), which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell.  Hopefully, they have fixed the problem but I wouldn't bet my money on it.  This camera has given us more frustration than it is worth
Received my camera today (05/22) and all items are not in the box.  I am missing hand strap, Ni-MH batteries, Battery charger and Cradle adapter.  Worse part is I DID RECEIVE A USB CABLE BUT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT SIZE AND DOESN'T FIT.  This is very frustrating.  How do I get the missing items
Camera died after firmware upgrade using the ethernet port to perform upgrade as Dlink recommends. I bought from Ebay new and Dlink refused to replace or repair. So beware if you pay several hundred dollars make sure you buy it from a authorized dealer or Dlink want work on it or even attempt to help you get it repaired. Think twice about buying Dlink because down the road you may have to throw it away regardless of the price you paid. Need to research other brands and see what their repair policy is after warranty, from unauthorized seller, or buying used.
I'm not a system analyst, so I need really clear instructions for any new device. I bought this camera 1 year ago to use as a home security camera which I could view from the Internet at my office. Troubles I encountered: 1.) Set up was impossible. I finally figured out that I had to disable the wep on my wireless network thus inviting all my neighbors to free Internet connection. I wasn't willing to do this. 2.) I could view from the Internet within my home network, but not from my office. 3.) Had to convince one of my company's IT system analysts to visit me at home and trouble shoot the camera's system. Took her 3 hours of guess work but she successfully set it up and keep my network secure-- which worked until I had to reset my router. 2 weeks of use in one year.4.) I have never been able to have the camera send "snap shots" to my e-mail or ftp folder. D-Link tech support confirmed that I was setting it up correctly... but the feature doesn't work. I was told by D-Link tech support that I may need to disable my Internet security program. No can do.5.) D-Link tech support may not have access to this product- they are not able to respond to my inquiries. They would send me answers- but not to the questions I asked!6.) The weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time I have tried to purchase- so I have not been able to install on the outside of my home. It therefore must be used inside which is not what I need. I could have paid  $80 for an indoor camera.  Every so often, when I have a few hours to burn, I drag it out and try to make the thing work. For the couple weeks it was viewable on the Internet it provided a nice view of my home, but it wasn't useful without snapshots or any type of archived image documentation.  
There is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger.  It works fine.  However the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me.  1 -- The connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for Zune so you have to take it out of the case.  2 -- The signal is VERY WEAK and did not work for me in either of my cars.  I ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100% better sound quality
Reception is not that great with the stock rubber duck antenna and also the press to talk button and the channel changing buttons are way to close together making it awkward to use,would not buy again.
This mic is a piece of trash ...I bougth it and you have to shout to be listened..es una completa basura y una perdida de recursos
Our company bought two of this model in 2005 for our new branch office.  After we set them up, it works just fine.  We didn't use any of the advanced features at that time.  After reading the user's guide and online forum at the Linksys web site, we found out that there are a battery inside the router that is NOT user replaceable.  You need to send it in for replacement.  Sure enough, we now have two routers that can't retain any configuration settings.  They all reset to factary default all of a sudden, one after 1 year, the other after 1 and half year.Also note, we updated one of the router to newest firmware, which prevents any kind of connection from the internet.  Needless to say, my boss is really crossed with me because I was the one recommend the model
I'm sure it would work well somewhere, just not for our small business.  I put it behind an ADSL router and used it to authenticate PPPoE.  It was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was, it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected. After hours on the phone with tech support from Linksys and the DSL Router people, nobody could help.  While it connected, it did work very well, it just did stay up.  Too Bad
VERY DISAPPOINTED in this phone.  I have an early generation Uniden phone (without answering machine) that was a total joy.This turkey has weak audio and ear-piercing intermittent static.If you bother to look at earlier reviews, you will see that this is a common problem with this phone.Avoid at all costs
It was time to get a new cordless phone and I bought this because it was on sale, and featured hard number buttons -- I find it more difficult to dial phones with soft, squishy buttons. Bad decision. You can't hear anyone even with the volume set to maximum, the answering system is just as bad in terms of registering voices, and apparently no one can hear me. I plugged in my headset to the jack, and they can hear me, but I can't hear them. There is static everywhere -- you can't use it in range of fluorescent lights, TVs, computers, speakers, etc. In a small house with compact fluorescent bulbs everywhere, try that! This phone is worthless and if I can return it, I will
My Cyberhome portable DVD player worked for all of 1 day. It is unable to play DVDs or CDs of any type. Also, if you charge the battery according to manufacturer specs, it will completely drain out within 24 hours. I attempted to get service from Cyberhome to no avail even though product is still under warranty. Their support number is unreachable as is their support email address. Attempts to locate the company via the web were unsuccessful. This would have been a great product at a great price if only it had worked.Purchase at you own risk. Check out the manufacturer web site. You have been warned
Product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web. In addition, no "all region code" supportted! I will return it ASAP.
I bought this antenna hoping that it would improve signal strength as they advertised 6dB on the box.  The performance was worse than the original 2dB antenna that came with my wireless adapter.  Back it goes
I have just now tested my signal strength at various locations with the D-Link DI-624 router's original antenna, and with this one.  The HAI6SIP made no difference whatsoever at any location, regardless of its orientation.  It's going back to the store tomorrow
I purchased this battery as a replacement for the original battery in my cordless telephone.  Although I fully charged the battery upon arrival, it will not hold a charge for more than 24 hours.  I would not purchase this battery again
The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.If this is an example of Grundig's work, I'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products.
I must say that I had to return my Atdec wall mount, cuz it's made in a cut corner  way that should be rejected. VESA measurements are 75mm or 100mm, and usually 100mm we would be using. This Atdec wall mount has one piece @ 100mm, but the second part is only 75mm, so it has the smaller 75mm screw-ins. On my 2 LCD PC monitors, the monitors had 100mm screw fittings, so I was forced to put the 75mm piece of the mount afixed to the wall. This made the piece on the wall set in w/ small distance between screws. Ifelt unsure, and after turning my wall mounted monitor on  off a few times. the wall mount 75mm piece started to loosen. Don't buy this mount. Peerless is a far better unit to get for yourself
I don't want to rate this product, since I haven't used it.  I had to, though...  I just wanted to share with everybody that this product still does not come with a charger.  I received them, left them unopened upon not seeing a charger, called customer service (they didn't do anything about the posting), and sent them back.  A waste of time and effort and extra hassle and waiting to get the money back.  Do not get mislead by pictures or descriptions
The battery packs in these walkie talkies last for about an hour only- I am very disappointed in the quality.  We need them for emergencies throughout the day- this is a farmed animal sanctuary- non-profit and we cannot afford to purchase new batteries after paying for these already.  I am willing to change my review if we get new batteries.  They came on time- they are good quality- other than the batterie
This product didn't work with my wireless mouse, scanner, and it would mess up my print que and I would have to restart the Keyspan software to get it working again.I returned it
It was very bright at first.  Then button began malfunctioning.  I emailed customer service and never heard back.  Don't know if it was a problem with my unit or a poor quality button
This cheap piece of plastic broke within 2 months of me owning it!! Buyer beware!
I have returned this item to Amazon; I paid $43.99 when they had it in stock. The audio out on this dock is a stereo mini (1/8") jack, the connection is terrible from then getgo, with low volume, distortion, and noise when the jack is jiggled.I would highly recommend the dock they're currently selling at Radio Shack for $29.99. It has RCA outputs on the back and excellent sound quality, it charges, and the remote has a menu button
I bought a 700 series iRiver to use at the gym, which came with this Armband, at first it was great, but it didn't last, there are two clasps which don't sta attcked well, and the pocket that holds the mp3 player itself is held together with a glue that comes undone after a few weeks of daily use
4 months into it and it stops playing, jams up and i can't remove the cassette or any or the Cd's.....won't ever but Pioneer again
This was ok for the money, decent sound quality, however it died on me after just 2 months of use.  The USB drive still works (sometimes) but the built in player no longer works. I found the controls less than user friendly and difficult to use
do not buy this system.  for the money there are much better systems out there.  I bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers.  The main problem with the system (which bose has corrected by the way) is that the "acoustimass" component (bose's fancy name for a subwoofer) is not active (or powered) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges.  The result is that you get a very "tinny" sound out of most applications including dvd's.  I ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better.  In hindsight I would have bought a different brand than bose, but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely, and the size of the cubes is nice.  Still pissed that I spent that much money on a substandard system, but hey, got sucked into the bose marketing machine
these are by far the worst headphones i have ever bought. I did not know they could make headphones whith such horrible sound quality. They also feel like they are made of cheap plastic. Definently not worth the $15 i paided for them
i bought this to replace an 80gb portable firewire drive. wanted more capacity and the same convenient portability. there's nothing convenient about its need for 2 USB slots and the data moves slower than the firewire drive it is replacing. nice little glitch on the small type of the packaging... if you're reading the requirements for Mac OS X you miss the bullet point in the Win XP section calling out the need for 2 free ports. Amazon's description of the product is similarily misleading as completely negelcts the mention of needing TWO USB ports...boooo seagate. i'm offended that you're offering such clumsy connectivity
I spent $60 on this and it broke after 6 months.. I guess the old saying, "you get what you paid for" is true. :(
Do not by this product. It has several issues. Go to the forums on the Linksys website and see for yourself. Most people, myself included, have problems with the cable modem crashing and requiring a reset on a regular basis. This device also has firewall issues that cause problems with the Wii and Xbox360. It's SPI firewall component is at fault and can not be disabled without turning off the entire firewall. Even in the face of the number of users having problems Linksys has never released a firmware update and it doesn't appear that they will
This combo cable gateway and wireless router seems like a dream come true.  Instead, should you fail to heed my warning and purchase this item, you'll be subjected to a nightmare that will only end when you seek another wireless solution.As a cable gateway the WCG200 performs as expected.  Setup with my ISP (Cox in southern California) was a breeze.  I was up and running in no time.Wireless connectivity, however, has been an absolute nightmare.  None of my devices (laptops, bridge, print server) will stay connected for any length of time.  When the router is performing well, I'm lucky to stay connected for an hour.  When the router is performing poorly I can barely stay connected for 15 seconds.The Linksys forums are crowded with other users reporting the same problem.  I've been unable to find any official acknowledgement or response from Linksys.Do yourself a favor and avoid the WCG200.  You will regret purchasing it
When we brought this home and took it out of the box we were rather impressed with the sleek design and the Cisco label. When we got it all hooked up all our dreams of surfing the internet at the speed of light turned into nightmares with constant connection drops and NO TECH SUPPORT! If you read the boards on the Linksys site you'll see that there are no end of connection failures across many different ISP's and areas of the US since this item has been released. PLEASE don't waste your money on this worthless hunk of garbage, you'll end up sucking down 2 bottles of ibuprofen and a 12 pack of your choice before the night is even through
After less than one week of use, I am forced to return this product due to its inability to maintain a reliable network connection.  In 5 days, I have had to cycle power on this unit, on average, more than once per day after it locks up.  The Web UI fails to respond to connection requests, it loses the ability to communicate with the internet and the only solution is to cycle power.  I have tried to work with NetGear technical support, but their suggestions (e.g., lower MTU) have been useless and their responses quite tardy.  If you are looking for a firewall/VPN unit, I suggest you pass on this particular product
After just one week of use and installing the newest firmware, this router began showing sickly signs requiring a daily reboot. By week two it began needing to be rebooted every 15 minutes. This now seems typical of previous experiences I have had with other Netgear products.  So much for plug and play.My recommmendation: leave Netgear to the passive routers and use another brand for firewalls and DHCP serving
This is the only card that has ever failed to work on my Palm Tungsten C, so I know it's not a hardware problem with my PDA.  The handheld device recognizes the card and FileZ shows that the programs and databases are present and available, but the program doesn't run -- the only response I get is "Loading from card. Please wait."  But nothing happens.  My repeated queries to tech support via its Web site have gone unanswered.  Don't count on any help from the company if you also get a lemon
I sincerely hope iPods have improved... I bought a 30G iPod Photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently, outside the warranty (which of course goes from original purchase date, not replacement date), it's kaput again. Now if I have to pay $275 for Apple to fix or replace a three month old player! No way. THREE players on the blink, each after a few months - that isn't just bad luck. That isn't even mentioning the difficulties with the iTunes software or if you change computers. I get a new PC and have to re-transfer 100s of CDs! How lame. That negates all the convenience of the large capacity (I wish other MP3 players had the storage space the iPods have). I just can't justify spending more money to replace this limited, inferior POS again. So essentially over the last year I have spent about $1 a day to have a player and now I'm left with nothing. I will be buying a different player. I will spend far less than $275 and get something that will last more than three months, is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use - obviously not an iPod! Unfortunately I can't transfer the music I spend hours and hours loading up (over and over). What a waste of money and time
Despite what the Belkin folk told me over the phone, this does not work on a mac
After constant dropouts for the past 6 months and no help from the "Belkin Bozo's"(support). I received a long delayed canned e-mail answer to my problem which didn't help a bit. I finally got rid of this piece of junk and installed a Linksys Network Card. Both Linksys hardware and software are a vast improvement. No more dropouts.I would suggest that prospective purchasers of Belkin products hesitate before buying.. It's one thing to have a product that works intermittantly, but it's really frustrating when Product Support is worthless
I wish I had read the Amazon reviews of this item before I paid $19 for it at an office supply store. It may seem a bit trivial, but the smell of this wrist pad was a deal breaker. It's unfortunate, too, because everything else about it is perfect: the color, the comfortable gel support and soft fabric, and the size (it runs the length of my Mac keyboard and provides support when I use my mouse). But the smell: a piercing, toxic smell that does not go away. It doesn't matter if I spend five minutes or five hours in front of my computer, I still smell the synthetic backing of the wrist pad, and it's made it impossible for me to work. I finally had to get rid of it
I love this minisisc. It holds an incredible amount of songs--the equivolent of an I-pod mini-- and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great. BUT DON'T BUY IT HERE! Just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by $9.00 while everything else in my order would have been shipped free. And you can get them at your neighborhood Radio Shack for the same price as here. I got a HI-MD recorder instead of an I-Pod and I'm glad I did. Just don't buy the disks from Amazon
Don't waste your money on these things! You can get a far better pair of headphones for comparable or less money spent. These things are nothing more than a marketing scheme to sell a look and fashion accessory. These headphones sound terrible and are very uncomfortable. TOTAL P.O.S.!!
Skull candy ear phones do look nice...but it stops at that. Within 2 seconds of putting them on, they hurt. The things are HORRIBLY uncomfortable and do not look or feel very solid. The sound was ok, but not great...and not very loud even with the in line volume turned all the way up.Yes they do look good, but head phones should sound great and be comfortable, looking good should be a bonus....not the entire sales point. I am very disappointed in Skull Candy. If you want good ear phones for a reasonable price, go for Sony or Senheisser. If you want a fashion accesorie...go with skull cand
I have 8860dn - it based on the same engine as this one, the only difference - wireless.  So here is my experience - hope it will be helpfull.I was with HP for 15-20 years, needed MFP, read all reviews here and decided that MFC-8860DN will be a good choice (other option was HP 3055).  It has everything I need - copier, network print, scan, fax.  Easy setup (I am in IT for 25+ years).  Everything was almost perfect.  The only complaint you need to keep in mind - IT EATS 1100 WATTS when starts printing - light could flash.It was OK, until I reached 1500 pages mark - it start printing small dots every ~3".  No problem - need to clean everything (per my experience and confirmed on Brother's web site).  Cleaned - it was the biggest mistake - all outputs were with tons of small dots all around the page.  Called Support 2 times.  After few hours of troubleshooting - they advised me to replace DRUM.  Hey - its only 1500 pages, nowhere close to promised 25000!  After I mentioned it, they offered me 75% discount on it.  What's about warranty?  Sorry.  I spoke to supervisor, he explained that Support in Philippines can't do it, the only option - to call USA office.I replaced DRUM.  Now counter shows around 2000 pages and I have same problem again.Hey, I heard this before - never say never.  Still as of today:I would NEVER, NEVER buy Brother printer/MFC again!!!
Let me start off by saying like some others out there, Theses seemed like a dream come true.  Got my First PAIR( yes i said first) and used them with my existing motherboard soundcard.  They sounded about the same as my old ones but that was to be expected.  I was saving in the meantime for the AC-1 soundcard that goes w/ the head phones.  One day i come home and go to play a game and no sound is coming out of the left ear and one of the lights on the vol control is dead.  DOuble check with oter PC's and verify bad headset. OK no problem amazon was great with the exchange. got my 2nd pair in a week. I decided to wait til i got the soundcard to hook the headphones back up.  got the card for my B-day and went to town and set every thing up only to find that the left rear channel was not working but if i pushed on th cord a little you could here a small sound. Plus one of my 3 dvd roms now did not work on account of a IRQ conflict i believe. O' Well just bad luck i guess.  Sent it back, again amazon very good about it.  Soundcard sound ok with my old headphone but does not have EAX or X-fi which alot of games use.  Today i got an email saying that Amazon realizes there is a problem with the headpones and will not send me a replacement but will refund me my money and will take back the sundcard as well. so there you have it. Razer seems to have issues with it's production, thats what you get for outsorcing manufacturing. Amazon was great and I'm Happy they didn't just ship me another POS
So, I bought this a couple months ago.  At first, I was in love.  Great sound quality, and the surround sound aspect works well in FPS games.  Also VERY comfortable, much more so than any other 5.1 headphones I have owned.  The initial favorable impression wore of pretty quickly, though.  First of all, the microphone *sucks*.  I've seen better microphones on 20$ radio shack headphones.  These are GAMING headphones, and expensive ones at that.  You would think the microphone would be at least passable.  It isn't.  Secondly, the build quality is pretty bad.  Within a few weeks, the control brick started giving me problems.  The sound would go off on one side or the other.  A bit annoying.  This only happens sporadically, and can be "fixed" by squeezing the sound controller.  Not quite bad enough for me to seek a replacement, but annoying nonetheless.  I've also discovered that the headphones are assembled with screws -  screws that aren't properly inserted, and they have a tendency that fall out. Now I have a washer flopping around inside the right headphone, and I can't find the tiny screw.  So I'll have to either try and repair it myself, which means trying to find somewhere I can buy tiny rare screws, or have to send it in for repair.  I might as well send it in for repair, because maybe they could also fix the volume controller...Really kind of disappointing for supposedly "premium" gaming headphones.  The microphone is bad enough to almost make it worthless for ventrillo or TS.  And the problems with build quality are really unacceptable for headphones of this price.  I bought some 5.1 headphones for 40$ a few years back...  they only lasted a year, but they had none of the issues that the Razer has.  Kind of sad that a cheap Chinese imitation is actually of better quality than this expensive crap. 
Installed quickly, great image quality, but within three days the card started to overheat and cause the computer to reboot. I was told by others and ATI forums that the 1650 pro with ATI stock heat sink is KNOWN for its problems. Do not buy 1650 Pro unless sapphire or other upgraded coolant system on the card. Also note, this may be an unrelated issue, after so many crashes the motherboard was fried and needed to be replaced. Cannot tell if related to video card or not yet.  If you are wanting an ATI stock card, there have been no known issues regarding stock cooling with the AGP 1800  1900 series cards.
This product is not worth the money or trouble.  I also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up.  It was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up.  Save your money and don't buy this. This would actually qualify for a zero star rating
Simply put, the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely. There are always bubbles.  If you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you.  The keyboard soft material cover is not so bad, but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard.  So, when you close the lid, the material then transfers some of that dirt right back.  My resolve...just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft, clean, semi-wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster
I purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle.  They are were very uncomfortable from the start, but I could listen to music.  That didn't last long.  The connection would not hold and if I didn't hold it together, the music faded out. Also, music faded in and out from ear to ear. I finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less
When you buy a name like Sony, you expect to get decent stuff.  This DVD Recorder failed miserably.  No S-Video inputs in the rear so you have to run S-Video to the front panel (which my 2 year old loved to unplug).  Nice editing features if you have the time.  Unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done (who knows if I will get it back).  I replaced it with a Lite-On DVD recorder (at less than half the price) and am very happy with it
I bought this DVD recorder because it was one of the few that recorded onto virtually every format.  Plus, it's a Sony, and I've never had any problems with Sony before.  The recorder works intermittently.  It recorded a few hours worth of shows, then it would corrupt the disk, rendering it useles (abaout 2/3 of the time).  I thought maybe it was the media, so I bought Sony media (this time it only corrupted the disk 1/3 of the time). I sent the product to Sony for repair and "they could not duplicate the issue" so they sent it back.  The Sony repair service center is located in South Texas, where the labor is cheap and it shows.  I got my unit back, and on the 2nd disk, it failed!!  Now the door is jammed and I can't take the DVD out.  Don't buy this product.  I'm buying Samsung from now on
Awesome concept, however I live in an apartment that doesn't have any south facing windows, so I was unable to get a signal.  I strongly advise against calling the XM radio help # from a phone that won't use up your cell phone minutes.  Had to call them four different times, and all they did was read me the instruction manual, and tell me that if I don't have signal my radio won't work (I had clearly established that fact already).  I recieved the radio for free because of a rebate, and didn't even intend on getting XM radio, but figured since the unit was free, and an MP3 player, to give it a try.   I was going to break down and buy the $70 car kit but then I ran across the AGT sportscaster for $20, which came with a car kit.  Since I can't use it in my house, I hook up the home base to the car kit, and at least I can use it that way.  This ended up being a lot of work for something I wasn't sure I wanted in the first place.  Haven't used the MP3 player yet, but napster does not seem the most user friendly.  (I have the majority of my songs on Itunes
I'm sure this item would have received a 5 star rating if I had used it; I have found Samsung products to be very good.  I did not use this item because of the additional charge it would have added to my XM Satellite Radio Subscription.  I already am paying costs for two radios.  I purchased this item to have more portable capabilities, but I did not want to incur an additional charge on my XM account.  Consequently, I returned the product without using it
Memorex changed the cases in this package, yet failed to reflect this on the packaging.  I purchased them at a local Office Depot.  It's the one with the patented hub that's supposed to protect your DVDs center.  Anyway, the two packages I got are no difference in comparison to regular cases I've gotten with sets I've bought.  I felt ripped off and will be returning these to the store for a refund
For the price this is not a bad keyboard.  Here are the two major problems I have with it:1) The feel is nothing like a real piano.  The keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note.2) The instructions have a big sticker on them, stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and/or birth defects (including lead) and to "wash your hands after handling".  How on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot, very possibly by children?It's going back...
Claiming that this fan's "3-speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling", is very misleading. On low, the fan barely moves any air. On high, it still doesn't move much air, and is incredibly quiet, nearing silent in my opinion. If you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads, this is NOT the fan for you. The 3-speed switch is useless, as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high
The buttons on the remote, although many, are not useful.  The only button we use (to advance or back up slides in a presentation) was difficult to use, poorly located, unreliable.  NOT a good selectio
This stuff is great.  My wife and I use it to label things we don't use often so we can tell at a glance what is in a box or what a bottle contains.  It goes into the labeler without a fuss and works the first time every time.  The glue on the back (once the backing is peeled) requires the the surface be dirt and oil free or it will eventually come off.  The printing will "wear off" if you are using it in a high friction environment such as on a book in a backpack.  However, it lasts long enough that whatever it is on becomes habit and the label is no longer necessary.BTW, if I did not have fingernails, I could not peel the backing off without using a large paperclip.  There ought to be suggestions from Brother about the best way to get the backing started off the label
I purchased this product to share my DVI monitor and Logitech Bluetooth keyboard/mouse between my two main machines - the exact use promoted by the manufacturer.  I successfully patched the firmware to eliminate the incessant beeping, but am extremely disappointed with the DVI video at 1600 by 1200 (severe streaking and noise), and the audio is totally unuseable given the severe hum and noise.  BTW, I am using Belkin KVM cables.Don't even THINK about purchasing this unit
Warning: This unit has flaws that can render it useless. My intention was to share my DVI monitor with my USB keyboard and mouse between my PC and Mac.  Simple enough, this unit fit the bill according to the specs.  However, as soon as I hooked everything up per the directions, the unit started beeping like crazy and would not stop.  I had to disconnect all the cabling to get it to stop as everyone in my office ran to my desk to see what the noise was all about.  Alright, 20-minutes Googling for support lead me to the conclusion that I needed to perform firmware upgrade.  WARNING: DON'T DO IT!  Attempting a firmware upgrade on this unit from XP will most certainly render it a paperweight.  There is no fixing the unit after the firmware upgrade fails, and it will under XP.   When I tried the update I the utility reported "tramsit error."  Note the spelling on the word "transmit" - that is how Belkin spells it in the utility.   If they cannot spell correctly in a vital utility such as a firmware upgrader, what chance is there the code is quality?  Anyway, that was the kiss of death.  The unit was dead and had to be sent back for RMA.  Unacceptable!I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It is the WORST.KVM.EVER
Not worth one star! Lasted about 1 week, and then started emitting a high pitched whine loud enough to wake people in the next town. It is now officially DEAD and USELESS. Even the short while it "worked" it was almost useless. Switching speed and mouse response was frankly terrible, the keyboard lagged several characters behind my typing and fitting the cables into it was simply not possible. DO NOT BUY THIS. Don't even THINK about it.
I'm sure this product is fine. But don't order it through Amazon, through Ritz Camera. They just cancelled my order without warning, having listed that the bag was available. Freaking idiots
I bought these headphones as a replacement for my second pair of blown iPod earbuds, hoping to get stronger bass and better sound isolation. I got both. Unfortunately, the sound coming out of these headphones is extremely muddy and overly bass-heavy. Furthermore, they were quite painful in my ears the first several times I wore them and the mini-jack has a poor connection, often leaving me without sound in one ear. Do yourself a favor and spend the money to get a quality pair of headphones, particularly if you're looking to buy in-ear headphones.
I bought the Terk antenna in an attempt to pick up some AM and FM radio stations I was struggling with on my new bookshelf stereo system.  Perhpas because of my apartment building, or the quality of the stereo, the antenna didn't offer me much success in picking up stations any better than the factory-provided antenna.  I did notice improvement in the static (or lack of it) on stations that were already tuning in fairly well (they went from great to excellent), but the stations that were tuning in poorly got no better with the Terk antenna.  Overall, it was probably not worth the money paid
I was pretty excited about this player, having read about it in Runners' World. There are a lot of problems with it, however. While it is advertised as a sports MP3 player, in a lot of respects it isn't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports. My issues are:- Headphones are not at all appropriate for sports, particularly running.. they keep falling off, so I had to invest in a better pair of headphones. Kind of weird since it's supposed to be a sports player. Also, I spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before I could use them.- Hard to change music while running, and it often ends up doing something I don't want it to. You can't change the music without removing the MP3 player from the armband, which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can't tell from any picture.- Not easy to figure out the features of the player, such as the stopwatch, pedometer. Also hard to use once you do figure it out.- Software is a pain to use.- Organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player.That being said, I still use it. There are some good features:- Long battery life, recharges super quick- Very cool-looking player- Very easy to carry around.. can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size. I would not recommend this player and if given a choice, I would not buy it again.
The software is terrible, slow and glitchy. I have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player. The operators manual is just under 100 pages, so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls. Granted, the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive--assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual.
Purchased this TV December 10 after much research. Unfortunately for me the TV was defective on arrival!When it is working it is a very nice TV, but the customer support from both Olevia and Target leave a lot to be desired.Target will not replace the item... the corporate policy I am told is the item must be returned via shipping... you are responsible for packing the item and putting it outside for the shipping company to pick up... and once target receives the TV back and it is processed thru receiving a credit will be issued... they say within 30 days... my credit card company AE says it will take 6 - 12 weeks... All this time with no TV, paying interest on the credit card or paying the balance and not be able to purchase another one until everything clears... I don't know about you but that is pretty steep!Now Olevia... though it is under warranty I again must pack up the TV in the original box, ship it back to Olevia and when they receive it back they will ship another one to me... the TV weighs 100lbs packing it up is not easy and again I am without TV for a month or more while the transaction takes place. If I want a TV at the time the defective one is shipped I must give Olevia a $1600 credit card hold while they process the transaction. EITHER WAY THE CONSUMER GETS SCREWED!!The television has a one year warranty, I purchased the extended warranty... What else could I have done!?!I am told by both TARGET and OLEVIA this policy falls under the "other terms and conditions" ... I wonder why they don't actually say that?BUYER BEWARE OF TARGET AND OLEVIA!!!
This switch works really well.  I use it between a Windows XP and Windows 98 operating systems.  When switching to Windows 98, control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly.  However, when switching to the XP OS, control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds.  I also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one USB port on the PC.  It frees up a port.  Using the Numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch.  It also has buttons on the device itself to select which PC to control.  I rate this product 5 stars.  When I posted the first time, I thought I put 5 stars; but I must have accidentally selected 2.  I recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price
We used the CD player one time.  The next time we attempted to use it, it would not play the CD. We ended up having to return it because it was defective
I am a person who actually uses these items, alot. After 2 weeks of using these headphones, the right earpiece quit playing. And I hear MS is not suppporting anything that stops operating. Also, it is too expensive. I am enjoying the Zune, but all the accessories should be a little more accessible
SONY advertised this as a 18x burner for DVD+R media. I used the recommended brand (Verbatim) and Taiko-Yuden which are very high end media. I was only backing up home movies from my panasonic camcorder. The movies are in .mpeg format, I was only writing data and it should be no problem for any writter.  Unfortunately, I got only 12x write speed with the provided software, in a mac as well as in a PC. (Just slower than advertised, no clusters).It is a noisy drive too.I spoke with SONY costumer service and I could not get any satisfactory  answers. I had to wait a long time to be helped. They said that the drive was probably damaged. I returned it and I do not think the drive quality or the customer support represents the price of this drive.
I bought this to work with my eMac/700.  It met all of the system requirements given.  What wasn't said was that it wasn't supported by the Mac's 10.3.9 operating system and would only work while running the Toast 6 lite.  In other words I couldn't read or write disks from any other application on the Mac.  In fact it would immediately eject the disk when I quit Toast.Luckily, Amazon took it back.  They even paid the postage.  Unfortunately I'm still out my hours of research and 30 mile drive getting it to the post office.  Additionally,  having found a new "hi tech" way to fib,  I'm discourage from buying computer peripherals from Amazon.  I blame Sony for this.  I know Amazon can't check out every manufacturer's claims
the case was advertised in a size large enough to accomodate my camera but when i received it the size was very small.  now i am stuck with something i cannot use.  your return policy was that it had to be in original packaging and unopened.  how is one to know unless they open it
Usually I discount negative reviews.  I think people may have sour grapes against a company, or not understand how to install or work something.  I somewhat tech savvy - I installed our wireless network that took a little doing.  I work as a technical recruiter, so technology doesn't intimidate me.  I like technology.  So I had been nudging my husband for a print server so that I could print without going to the printer and plugging in.  He came home with this Belkin product and went about installing it.  Usually I like to research before I purchase a product, but he wanted to handle this.  So, he installed it, and I went back and checked his work, and he had followed the instructions exactly.  I know he had some trouble, and had called tech support at my suggestion - I would never have gotten the wireless router hooked up without tech support.  The only problem is, that the printserver doesn't work.  So, I tried installing the software on my pc, and trying to problem solve from there.  I called the tech support hotline back, and got an operator who promised to have a technician call me back in a short period of time.  I waited for 2 hours, then went out to run some errands.  There was still no message from a technician when I returned.This morning my husband needed to get some work done from home.  He created a document, and knowing that the print server did not work, he wired up to the printer to print that way.  But now, the printer won't respond to the signal, so he can't print that way either.  So we deleted the Belkin software and rebooted the computer.  He still can't print.  So, I went back to my PC, and tried to delete the software through the control panel.  It won't delete.  I am getting an error message.  I can't print either.So now I am on hold with Belkin customer assistance.  Maybe it's a coincidence but as good as the english is that the person who refers to himself as an operator is, I swear I hear a little Indian accent.  That doesn't mean that customer support has been outsourced to India, and even if it is, that doesn't mean customer support is bad.  But my experience with this is that while I can get a real live person on the phone, he can't do a thing to help me except promise me that someone will call back.  When I tried to get my problem escalated, I overwhelmed him and he put me on hold.  I am still on hold.  I have been on hold for 35 minutes with no help in sight. I called back from my cell phone, and someone who sounded so much like the first operator I spoke to said he would escalate my call to a level 2 technician, and someone would call back in 1-2 hours. When I strongly protested, asked for his name, asked for a number I could call directly, he offered to transfer me immediately, and now, I have been on hold for for an additional 10 minutes on my cell phone.I am starting to sense a trend here. My husband - boiling over his inability to print an important document, has gone off to work to print it there. I am sitting on my sofa with phones going on in stereo, waiting to see if anyone in cyberspace is going to pick up my call.  I usually discount negative reviews, but this is really my experience with this product, and if you are considering purchasing it, I would encourage you to think that through a little further.
Worked great for about a week, then i seemed to get an average of 12 telemarketing calls a da
I purchased this drive 6 months ago as a spare and just recently installed it. The drive has a controller board error.  I contacted Western Digital for a replacement, but they tell me that it is out of warranty.  Apparently the year warranty starts ticking the day the drive leaves the factory and not the day you purchase it.  If it sits on a store shelf for over a year you do not get any warranty from Western Digital. With other manufacturers providing 5 year warranties, I will never buy Western Digital again
If you want to talk to some that is soft spoken you better not be using the ATT5995 or Handset590-3. Turn the handset volume up all the way and you will still be looking for more, not even close. I do not have a hearing problem, but this phone had me thinking I did. The speakerphone volume is loud enough but very poor quality.
I bought this phone based on a review in Wired Magazine.  I love their reviews usually, but this one really let me down.  I read another customer's review (I forget where) saying they had sound quality problems, but I thought yeah right...one in a million.  Well I bought the phone and had the exact same experience.  Very poor sound/voice quality.  It sounded worse than a cell phone in an underground wind tunnel.  I cannot imagine why. I charged the battery for 48 hrs, I had it on a separate circuit, and it had it's own line. I plugged in an old GE 2,4 ghz phone an whamo...no troubles what so ever. Needless to say,  I took the phone back and bought a cheap desk phone with a cord.  Sometimes you don't get what you pay for
I purchased the MD781 + MD71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the MD681.  I really like the MD681 but I could never locate one of its expansion handsets (everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock).  Overall I'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use I am already looking for another phone.  Handheld phones:  I like them more than any other phone I've tried.  Unlike most phones these days they're big and have a very solid feel to them...it's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation.  The buttons are a nice size and easy to use. The hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well. With one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good, but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation.The shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better. It's a few clicks and slow to access...almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand...or copy the number to the local units phonebook...which defeats the purpose.As for the Answer Machine:  Once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of  how many messages, if any, are in the system (is it just me or is that poor design), so if you listen to messages when you partner isn't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages.   The quality of voice messages is a bit grainy.I also like how the handset docked in the older M681;  it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base...the MD781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk.
I loved this phone, but after only a few weeks the button is stuck and the phone can't pick up.  I want it fixed but don't know how
Unreliable pile of 'you-know-what'.  Worked fine for about 2 months then refused to power up.  Fresh batteries, no go.  Called customer "service".  Outsourced call center to India; rep followed generic script telling me to: 1) use lithium-ion batteries, and 2) press "power + NAV" simultaneously.  As suspected, bogus advice.  Fresh batteries metered out to 1.62 volts each / 4.84 volts total.  Yes, I tried lithium-ion batteries anyway.  Still no-go.  Am still waiting for Magellan/Thales to respond.  Am still owner of unreliable GPS.  Still have about $400 invested in unit plus software and maps.  Still kicking myself for buying a Magellan product.  Don't do it.  Really -- don't do it
I purchased my 500 in September, it's now January and it has never worked correctly at all. It would say that I am in Russia, then lock up (I live in NJ USA). The first time that I sent it it, my expense, Magellan support sent it back to me within 24 hours; and it was not fixed. It still said that I was in Russia and would lock up. The second time that I sent it to them, they sent me a shipping label via email. They had it in their paws for about 2 weeks. It came back said that I was in Peru and then lock up. I have an old Lowrance and never had a problem receiving a signal, it always locked on to my location (albeit a little slow), and it worked.I've been trying to get a new shipping label for this piece of junck now for one month. First they said that they sent it to me via email, but they said that because I have anti-spyware sw on my pc that my Outlook is rejecting the label. But, I use web based email. Then they said that they will send a label to me via regular mail. It's been two and a half weeks and I have not yet received that label. They told me that they sent it out 3 days before Christmas and that I didn't receive the label because of the delays in mail due to Christmas and New Year's. But it's now January. Who knows, maybe I'll be lucky and receive the label before 2008.It's clear to me that they have no intention of fixing this piece of junk. It was a mistake to buy it; don't you make the same mistake.
This is a great idea: a small CD player to match the rest of the Tivoli line. Unfortunately, the quality of the units I tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the Tivoli line. All in all, Tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems: one wouldn't play the disc, one wouldn't eject the disc, one had an LED readout that would go blank, and one had variations on all of these problems. The Model One is a great product and the PAL and the others are close behind, but the Model CD needs a lot more work
Setting this unit up has been impossible, and I have not been able to use it.  I have sought help of Dlync website, dlynk phone support.  The have not been able to work me through it.  I have paid for a machine I cannot use, have spent countless hours on phone and computer in trying to set it up.  Another person who has the same system with which I wanted to communicate has had the same problem and cannot use hers
If you are not  an IT person you will need help setting  up .Using D-Link customer service is a chore due to language issues .I bought the video phone to contact my son in Taiwan and it never would connect ==D-Link HELP LINE ?? ==could not understand why and were  of no  help  what so ever .I could reach the test location but that was it .=Complete waste of money !!
My daughter bought this for me so I could see my grand children who live in other states.  I have spent 6 days and almost $450 trying to get it to work. I even hired a computer repairman who charged me $184 and could not get it working.  If it was not a gift I would send it back to get my money back.  I called the help line, lots of times and usually got someone who didn't speak English very well. They would end up telling me it was a problem with the router.  Then I would call the router and they would tell me it is a problem with the D-Link.  No one wants to take responsibility for getting it working.  I even went on the support page on the internet and read pages of things that could be wrong.  Tried them all in six days and I still don't have it working and has cost me alot of time and "money".  Good Luck if you buy it you will need it
I have to admit, the main reason I purchased (2) of these DVC-1100's was because of the stellar reviews posted here on Amazon.  I bought one for my in-laws and on for my wife and I so that they could watch our children grow up over long distance.  Great idea, bad solution.  The main problem I had was that the camera lens is fixed, and does NOT focus.  I waited 1 hour on the line with D-LINK tech support only to learn that the lenses on these cameras are designed to be fixed and only focus when you are approximately 6 - 8 feet away from the camera.  Unfortunately, the ones I got did not focus at all, and the video quality was absolutely terrible (washed out color and bad contrast).  Please listen to me, save your money and do not buy the DVC-1100.  This device is cheaply made, and just not there yet..
A nice idea that doesn't provide adequate audio quality in my experience. The unit would pick up "noise" from the operation of my CD player, resulting in a background squealing that was especially audible between tracks. In addition, on trips I had to frequently flip through the various frequency settings to avoid conflicts with radio stations
FM transmitters of this size don't last forever. That is a fact I accept but I had hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks. I bought my first one from Target before a road trip in a uhaul without a cd player. The sound was marginal at best and by the end of the three day drive to Oregon it was extremely noisy. I plugged it in to my computer to transmit some streaming stations and it had trouble hitting the receiver (direct line of sight) no more than 40 feet away. Two more days and it crackled its last and died. I exchanged the transmitter at Target for a new one and a week and a half later I was returning that one as well. Spend a few extra bucks, save yourself the hassle and get a Belkin.
I ordered this product and put it in my Nikon D200.  The product was improperly manufactured, and caused the pins in my camera to bend, rendering it inoperable.  I had no idea what the cause was, and went to my camera store, and ended up damaging one of their cameras as well.We took a quick look at the card, and the holes were obviously improperly aligned.  The damage to the cameras was repairable, and the replacement card I received worked ok, but this is really not an acceptable situation for such an expensive piece of equipment
The one I ordered works, but the plastic nub in the rear of the unit I received has a slightly-flawed location. The nub is intended to insert into the ground hole of your recepticle (outlet). My nub is slightly too high, preventing it to be plugged into a top outlet -- because of this nub, it'll only work in the bottom outlet. I see little reason for this plastic protruding nub to exist in the first place..
I purchased 16 of the Allsop 26625 DVD/VHS Organizers. After I had 4 or 5 of them on the floor, loaded with DVDs, I was going to move them to load the next batch. But, when I picked them up off the floor, two of them came apart, dropping the DVDs on the floor. Knowing they were weak, I tried to hold the next one together, but pressed a little too hard on opposite corners; the other two corners gave way, and my hands came together, scattering DVDs all over the floor.Looking at the pieces that came apart, I saw that hooks were molded into the plastic and were supposed to snap over ridges on the next piece. But the hooks were too shallow to hold against the strain of holding them with the DVDs facing upward, and they were the same on all 16 boxes.I emailed the manufacturer (from whom I had bought 12 of the boxes) and asked, since it would be time-consuming for me to send them back, and costly for them, what would they offer me if I just kept them and glued the corners together. I had absolutely no response.I ended up spending two evenings snapping the boxes apart, glueing the 112 attachment points and reassembling them. I think they will be OK, now, but I would not have purchased them if I knew they were so poorly manufactured. And, I do not have any good thoughts about Allsop's customer service
PNY memory is not very specific on its products, check and re-check that the specs. are what you need. PNY is more a reseller of dubious memory brands of asiatic origin (not that others are'nt, but...), pay the extra and go for respected brands like Viking and Kingston, you can't go wrong. In the long term, it's a better investment
Nothing that uses FW400 responds to being plugged into this device, whether is it bus powered or not.Bloody useles
Just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced.  This is a $5.00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit.  It will protect against scratching, but only the areas of the unit you're not really concerned about.  The screen is totally exposed, so it can be scratched when in the unit.  I'm sure that's so you can see the screen better, but a clear protective cover (that can open and close) over the screen would have been nice.  Anyway, at $25.00 this is too much to spend.  I'm ordering a leather cover with a kick stand (which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table) for less than the price of this product.  I feel I just flushed $25.00 bucks down the drain, hopefully you will not. 
Did not work with my Palm T|C right away.I've not used this for any other purpose. I expect either Palm or SD to release proper software to have it work with Palm T|C
Do not order this item and expect to get what you see.  I ordered the Super High Speed card (RPSDH01GU1A) and what I got was a low quality High Speed card (RPSDK01GU1A).  Seems to be some kind of a scam that Ritz is running with Amazon's blessing.  Buyer beware.  This has happened to me before when you order from one of Amazon's partners, and Amazon will do nothing to help you
I paid $35 for a barely adequate product case. It does not securely mount or protect the Creative Zen. It is overpriced and underperforms. As others have mentioned, you must cut it out of the protective covering only to discover that the internal configuration of the case does not protect the screen nor clamp or positively hold the player. The set up feature is a joke -- you have to configure the assembly with an elastic band. taking it out of case voids the ability to return the product. The Design engineer should be fired.DO NOT BUY -- THIS IS JUN
The product didn't do what it said it would. I cut the power to use it in my car (I shouldn't have assumed it worked properly) so I couldn't return it and ended wasting $50. I was extremly dissapointed in this product
For $99 this should be a much better remote.  If you watch movies in the dark, you have to use the glow button, guess what, you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least.  Also, Logitech has over simplifed the remote.  You can't program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly.  If you have to go into the device menu  a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume.  Why not have an option to program each button period...  But the remote is useless now because of the low battery life.  Do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month.  Ridiculous.  Only remote I have ever had like this
It is very hard to update the remote. Very seldom we can delete and if there are two DVR boxes remote get confused and keep on turning off and on, even though we choose the right one such as A or B.Software update is cumbersome and take 45 minutes on a Intel Quad computer with 2 G memory. Can supply some patches. I have the remote sitting on my coffee table useless.
wow, how i can write a review about the item i have not received so far. i ordered this case on march 7th and to day is april 10th and it seems out of stock so far.well, i,m still waiting........
I love the Saitek 880 wired gamepad.  So I figured the wireless would be that much better.  Unfortunately, my next purchase will be another wired pad to ensure no problems.  There's nothing worse than the few times I really need two gamepads that the wireless one poops out.  I bought this and the batteries died.  I sent Saitek an e-mail and they sent me two new ones.  Great, they worked!  Then they died soon after.  Hopefully their new wireless, which runs on one AA battery will not have any issues.  However, this one's a dud
After 3 days of having this controller, it already started to have problems.  The docking station would not pick up charges from the battery anymore making my controller useless.  For the amount of money I spent, I am very disappointed
When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time).  The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it.  I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs).  This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced
but the touch wheel is harder to use. I bought this case about a month ago and immediately put my baby into it. Since that point time I had a harder time turning it off/pausing, adjusting the volume, using the back and forth touch points, and setting a stop point in a audiobook. This is the result of the mini being recessed into the case.I took my mini out of the case today and had immediate ease of use with the touch wheel again. The case will protect your mini without a doubt - but you lose the functionality that the wheel is so popular for.Also, make sure you tighten down the pivot head with a screwdriver since I nearly almost lost my mini because it came apart from the belt clip. I'll only use when absolutely necessary now.
I don't like these radios becase they only go about 1/2 the mile. The battery doesn't hold full charge. I would recommend going with motorola model or midland that will give you better range
I purchased this product to replace a really good 802.11g unit from Linksys, hoping to set up a Gigabit home network with ethernet storage.  I initially considered the WRT300N model, but the reviews were mediocre.  So I went instead for this newer model, hoping that Linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the WRT300N model.  I am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the WRT300N also apply to this model.  I am returning it after 5 hours of use.On my home network set up with my current Linksys 802.11g unit, I am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house, and all four movies display flawlessly.  On this new unit optimized for streaming video, I was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the wireless unit.  The movie had interruptions every 4-5 seconds.  This was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the wireless unit.  Performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with G cards and N cards.  And performance degraded as I tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time.The speed of the links to my laptops equiped with N cards was 144 Mb/s, and was 54 Mb/s on those equiped with G cards.  So the connection seemed fast enough.  It might be that by tweaking the wireless unit in some way, it might be able to perform as I expect.  But I don't have time to waste on such tweaking, and given that my 802.11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box, there is no point to "upgrade" to this new flawed model.  I'll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out
I doubt that they are all this bad.  Maybe I just got lucky.  The first time I put the tape in, the motor could hardly pull the tape.  When I tried to record, it played back all shaky, like a playing a record off-center on a turntable.  I returned it
I purchased this item recently at a local Radio Shack because it was on sale for $7.99.  In my case, I did not get the abysmal product that others here have encountered, but I did get a disappointing one.  I use an older CD writer (NEC NR-7800A) which is capable of burning at a maximum speed of 16X, and I have achieved that speed with other media (notably Imation).  In my system, however, these Sony discs are limited to a maximum of 8X no matter what data is being burned or what program is being used.  Either the disks are substandard or they are not fully compatible with my drive.  On the positive side, all the discs used so far have burned successfully and can be read by my DVD-ROM drive, DVD player, and CD player.There's no point in buying this Sony product when there are so many others out there.  Find a brand that works well with your burner and stick with it.UPDATE:  The current model number on Sony's web site for the 50-pack CD-R spindle is 50CDQ80LS3 (not 50CDQ80LS2).  If you still want to buy Sony, try to find the current model number
you may be tempted to buy these because of the 'sony' name...but be warned, DO NOT buy sony cd-r's off of amazon....I bought this same 50 pack, and had to throw half, yes half as in 25 of the discs, out because they had read errors and God knows what else.  I find this strange though, because I've  bought (and still do) these same sony cd-r's from best buy, and at target, and at staples...and they've always worked fine.  I thought I would give it a go buying the online and I'm sorry I did.  If you want the sony cd's, just go to your local target and pick em up there...at least I can tell, based off my experience, they'll work.  Can't say the same for the ones coming from amazon
My CD player has jammed in a similar fashion to those described above. I called the Harman Kardon customer service line, and they kept me on hold for ten minutes. Then I went to their website, which is poorly designed and slow to load due to an overabundance of flash graphics. The website told me to fax a warranty replacement form to Harman. I had to do that three times to get a response. Finally I got a return authorization after two days and several emails. Poor quality, poor customer support. Guess what H-K, I won't be buying any of your products in the future. This is a replacement for a Sony changer that worked flawlessly for 18 years. And, I may take HK to small claims court if the replacement doesn't work.
The Keyboard Protector fits very well on my MacBook, but in the end I got tired of how much slower my typing was when I used the protector. It claims it doesn't slow down your typing speed at all, but it really does; you have to push on the keys harder when you type and for me it took a concsious effert to do so. As I'm typing this review now, I'm not using my protector anymore. If you don't mind how it slows down your typing, then go ahead and get it.
This review is more about the Hi-MD concept in general than one particular player.The sound quality was excellent.  The rest of the product and concept deserves to die in the marketplace.Complaints:-The only thing that isn't proprietary is the headphone jack and the AA battery.  Beyond that, Sony's dual role as a content provider (complete with nasty intellectual property lawyers) and equipment manufacturer fatally compromises usuability of this line of players.  No Macintosh support is just the beginning.  Proprietary compression algorithms. Weird and twisted upload/download rules.  Wrong choices made at every point of the PRD process.-100x recording speed?  Make that 4x on a good day.  100x speed is a specification that should attract the attention of Elliot Spitzer, if he only cared.-The players are flimsy.  Just walking with mine caused it to skip.  And one hard fall to the floor and it stopped working entirely.  Sony will charge you to honor the warranty (parts only--no labor).  By contrast Apple replaced my daughter's iPod no questions asked when it started developing hard disk hiccups.-Trying to find Hi-MDs offers the thrill of the hunt, if you're into that kind of thing.  But their rarity suggests that Sony is at best half-hearted about supporting this device.I used to be a loyal Sony customer, but now believe they have gone almost irretrievably downhill.  Sleek designs do not compensate for disfunctional product management and shoddy manufacturing.  In fact, I'm planning an HD TV purchase next year and have Sony far down on the list of possibilities.  You can find better quality and value almost anywhere else these days.Howard, are you listening
 will not hold bose souround spkrs, will not mount for key hole speakers, also  i paid $11.99 for these on amazon, the saw them in wal-mart for $7.78 good for a cheap system, but if your speakers  weigh more than 5 lbs.  step u
I returned my Banshee stereo. It sure was loud, however the music seemed to wave in and out.  You cannot charge your iPOD either.  There is no remote.  There is no battery compartment - not portable at all.  There are many other choices for less price.  Save your money and look for something else
I thought I was getting a terrific deal on 6 ink tanks, they look exactly the same as those that came with the printer and those that are packaged individually.  But when I later bought a one-off replacement -- not "custom" -- tank I noticed the ink level bar on the printer LCD was not only full but also longer than the other bars!  If the "custom" tanks hold only about half the ink, this isn't the bargin it appears
There is a reason that the value pack is so much cheaper.  The cartridges are not full!  I just got off the phone with HP tech support and they confirmed this.  The cartridges sold with the value pack are labeled as *custom* cartridges that have enough ink to print 150 4X6 photos.  In fact, the tech support rep discribed the *custom* cartridges as having "way less" than standard cartridges, "less than 50% full".  On a related note, I asked him if the initial cartridges that came with my  new printer were full, and he said they should have been full standard cartridges.So this value pack isn't such a great value now, is it? 
I will never buy a brand new product release from Linksys again. Their Q.C. stinks. I am on the third WRT54GX4 router and it is the first that was not defective. I got it set up and tried my new WPC54GX4 network card(SRX400) and got a weak signal, but I had my second laptop with a WPC54GX card(SRX200) on the desk getting 100% signal strength. I switched cards in the two computers, and the old SRX200 card was better in either computer(both XP Pro). After hours with semi-English speaking techs, they came to the same conclusion I came to in five minutes...a bad antenna in the new WPC54GX4. So once again Amazon will replace a defective Linksys product for me. I had been a Linksys fan in the past, but not any more. Here's a link to a picture of the first router I got and its defect.http://vowe.net/archives/006639.htm
I tested this along with the Neuros MPEG4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the Neuros.  The picture with the SanDisk is very pixelated, especially with fast action sports like football and basketball.  The SanDisk does have a better interface, and is easier to understand and set up quickly, but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor.FYI - I'm using a PSP as my viewer
I got this CD player because I thought sony was a good company, plus I liked the look of it. But after just 5 months after purchase, and not even using it that often, it has already broken. I paid about 40 dollars for this CD player, so I am very disappointed. If I were you, I would buy a different CD player
I have always been a fan of Sony because they make quality products that are "user-friendly".  That is why I was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by Sony, because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture.First the bad...the control buttons (sound, changing tracks, pause, etc) are tiny and nearly impossible to read.  I found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button, and I do not have any vision problems.  The little lcd screen is hard to read as well.  Next, the sound quality is poor and has a cheap "watered down" feel to it.  Then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with.  These are cheap and don't fit well.I bought a yellow "psyc" sony walkman a couple years ago, and that one is 3 times the product that this one is.  The sound is near-perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use.  The headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all.I wouldn't write sony off simply b/c of this product, but I would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them. 
when I received my cobra nav system the cord to use it was missing and I have had to call three times and still nhave not received the cord.  I contacted Cobra, but I think it came from Target.co
I ordered this antenna to enhance the reception of the UHF channels. I live in a big city and I thought I shouldn't have a problem with any indoor antenna. it seems I was mistaken. this antenna is useless. it is almost no better than my previous 99 cents store antenna
I was tempted by the low price of this item. The only reviewer before me gave it a 5-star rating. Although aware of the unreliability of a single review, I decided to gave it a shot, and paid $10 for shipping--no other way since it's sold through a third party. $28 later, I was holding the biggest $#!* I've seen in a while! The construction feels very cheap, and the instruction manual makes absolutely no sense as if written by a 3-year old. And the worst of all, only one of the two microphones worked. Even the one that works is horrible--the sound out of the speaker is very weak unless you cup your hand around your mouth and the mic. It uses a 9-volt battery in each of the two mics, and that's another 5 bucks out of my pocket. You know what?  I'll probably have to eat the $33, since the seller does not refund any shipping charges and charges a hefty fee for returns. Well, I learned a lesson...things are cheap for a reason
Completely useless. Only shows a digital display when Ipod is "fully charged" -- how long does YOUR Ipod stay fully charged? Even when showing digital display doesn't actually broadcast. Maxell replaced it with the p-4A for a reason. Amazon shouldn't even be selling this, it makes me distrust Amazon. I got it as a Christmas present but it was bought in October so they won't even take it back. Follow up: After I emailed Amazon, they issued a complete refund, which they refused to do over the phone. Now they just need to pull the product, since they (probably wisely) aren't carrying the P-4A and therefore can't recommend it as an option.
The Pros: -You can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it's adhesive.-It allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well.-Doesn't prohibit any functions of the ipod (i.e. sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on)The Cons:-Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. I've carefully applied and re-applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways, and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime, especially on the screen. -If the screen is not lit up, all you can see is bubbles on the screen. -It doesn't do the ipod justice, because it looks so cheap when applied.-After 2 days with this product I'm already looking to replace it. 
I guess this is a bad review owing to bad item description, not bat quality. Turns out, it is NOT a universal ipaq stylus set, so make sure your ipaq is combatible!!
This router has been in operation for about 3 weeks.  When it is functioning correctly, it is a pleasure to use.  Unfortunately, it requires almost daily power cycling to keep it running - all the idiot lights show normal operation, but there's no wired or wireless connectivity until it's power cycled
This device worked great for a short span of time (a few weeks), then just stopped working.  I returned it to Amazon and received a new replacement.  It worked fine for a while, then stopped working.  It's a great idea, but very weak quality
I received this item and it proved to be defective. I have returned the original item and Amazon has been promising me that they would ship the replacement for over a month now but has failed to make any of their estimated ship dates. Right now I am looking for another source and about to cancel the order
The ad and description clearly state that it includes both a receiver and transmitter.  I received only a receiver. This is false advertising and is patently illegal. They ought to be ashamed of themrselves
I purchased one of these just shy of three years ago (Feb 2003). I have taken very good care of it (it stays in a pocket in my briefcase when not in use) and used it several times a week while I teach. Over time, the silver finish wore off around the "on" button (apparently from perspiration from my hand), exposing the copper underneath. Last week, the button froze in the "on" position, so it is now effectively useless. The laser diode still works, however.Also, the company offers "Geek Points" for future purchases that are supposed to be good for 36 months. I checked the site earlier this week and, while it's now only been 35 months, the ones I earned from this purchase are no longer on record
I bought this item with good price. Good deal for the space 300GB. Moved all personal videos and data with confidence. After 6 months no power coming up. Unable to switch on. Went to data recovery center and told $700 to $3000 depend on the issue. Seagate want to replace the drive but helpless on the data. Be careful when you buy these "Seagate 3.5-inch Pushbutton Backup External Hard Drives".- Venkat Vinnakota
I have been a subscriber for 4 years.  Back in November my account was turned off due to a billing issue. The week prior to it being turned off I started receiving 3 calls a day for payment.  I advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment, payment was made.  Calls stopped for another week.  The radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again.  I explained to the bill collectors I owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio I told them not to bother, at this point I wanted nothing more to do with XM.  They offered me 3 months of free service to come back, anyone who cancels can get this by the way, and I refused.  The 3 calls a day continued for the next week, I was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system....  2 more months go by and then I start receiving a bill saying that I reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that.  40 dollars.  I call in and state I never reactivated my radio, thus I don't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed.  The customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of, 2 weeks later I get another bill.  I call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences.  I even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved, and that rep confirmed that I no longer owed anything.  So then last month I start receiving COLLECTIONS NOTICES. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO PAY THIS BEFORE IT GOES TO COLLECTIONS.  I called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back.  This apparently has taken care of the issue, though I never received the call back.  This week I called 6 times, 3 of which I was promptly hung up on for no reason, and was told each time that it had been resolved.  So hopefully this time it really is...  To anyone considering XM I suggest you just get an MP3 player
I've purchased and attempted to install three of these adapters. One of them was on an older Dell laptop,installed without any problems at all and connected seamlessly to a Linksys WRT54G router with WAP encryption.The problems really started showing when I tried to install the second and third adapters, both on desktop computers running Windows XP SP2. The software installation was a breeze, but when I plugged in the adapter - nothing happened. Connect to network...which network? Scan..who? What?It looks like this adapter has a very, very short range and doesn't work very well a wall or two in between the routers. It would see the router and connect - to drop the connection and not find one. But then it would find it again, and on and off.Never really worked as expected on the desktops, so I've given up. I've had to disconnect them and reconnect them multiple times. Downloaded the updated software from Belkin's site, and still have connection issues with the desktops. The laptop works fine as long as I don't take it one room away from the router.Avoid at all costs please. I've used other wireless devices with the same router that I'm trying to connect and they work fine - a few rooms away and all.Spend a few more dollars and get something worth the money spent. Spend less time troubleshooting and more time surfing.Good luck
It may work fine for those who use ps2, but using usb it frequently locks up. I have my laptop and desktop plugged in, but if I unplug the laptop. I have to shut everything down, unplugg the kvm and start over. What a total pai
I tried it on 4 laptops, and none of them was able to sustain the signal. It kept on dropping out! Mind you, two of the internal cards did a much better job than it.
The bag is very nice looking, nice material, everybody loves it.  Lots of compartments inside fit all accessories I need plus some documents.  But the top part (the zipper) is a BIG problem, it just has to get 200% in a way, while the notebook pocket doesn't provide any flexibility.  I just have to scratch my brand new notebook in and out, very frustrating.  (same as another review here).  My opinion, find another one, I'm gonna do it myself
I have an HP Pavillion ZE5000 series laptop. My laptop hardly fits in this bag. The battery holder is also too small. Practically unusable. Very disappointed with the product
It came within one week of being ordered. It is an excellent product and is as advertised. I received a manual for Sony's Compact Disc Recorder instead of the manual for the VRDVC30
I ordered this cable a few weeks ago. Although I must say that it does work fine, the cable looks cheap (in fact, it is very thin) and its length is less than 6 feet. As you may agree, length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that. So for $20 (including shipping), I think it was not exactly a good deal
I bought an Airplay2 from am Apple store for around $60. Other than the fact that "blank" FM stations are hard to find in the New York Metropolitan area, and that you need to keep changing to different "blank" stations as you drive, the product itself is simply terrible. Even if you are in a parking lot, and find a "blank" FM station, the quality of the music the Airplay broadcasts is very bad. The bass is almost non-existent, and there is a constant hiss in the background that you cannot get rid of. This product is not worth buying, especially for $60
If you don't use the printer on a daily basis, these cartridges dry up only days after you stop. Given that the BJC-80 is a portable printer, I only use it while traveling, which means having to buy new cartridges for every trip. A real money drain
I've bought one of the 12c platinum because I needed a calculator in my office. I don't do financial calculations, so probably I'll use the calculator only to make elemental arithmetics, but I like RPN and the programmable features.Build quality is below expected: intro key responsiveness is different than other keys', the soft case finnish is bad and the support pieces are not well adjusted, so the calculator is slightly unstable. With the tag price this machine has you expect to get a perfectly assembled piece.Disappointed
Antec has dropped the ball on this one.  My power supply came in DOA.If you read reviews there are lots of reports of short life on power supply.  The case weighs 25 pounds.  It is a major hastle to uninstall everything and mail it back to California.  It is a pretty case with some well thought out features, but not worth reliability hastles
This cartridge does NOT fit my HP 648c as advertised. The color cartridge that accompanied it did, however
The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.If this is an example of Grundig's work, I'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products.
I did not like the fact that this microphone needs a hard to find battery which is not included in the box it was sold
What company would make a router that you can set up wired and then take it wireless and it won't work. Incredible. My experience mirrored exactly that of many who have already written. It just shouldn't be this way.When I finally did get it working, after tweaking some settings, and spending all freaking day on the Linksys forum it had virtually no signal in a very modest house.I do have to say the their forum is top rate. The people were very helpful and very friendly and a great place to turn if you don't want to go through scripted support suppliers.Product wise a very disappointing experience. People wise very good but long gone are the days that you put up with an inferior product because the people are so good
First of all, I am a dyed-in-the-wool techie.  I design products like this in my job.  I know what every single one of those "what the heck is that?" settings in router set up screens are.  So I do take a bit of umbrage when one reviewer called the many (most) who have had trouble with this router "MORONS".  Yes, I got it to work.  It will work right out of the box IF used with most pre-N wireless cards and, definitely, if they are Linksys pre-N cards.  That covers about 1% of those who would buy this router.  After three hours of tweaking a dozen plus of the settings from default, I succeeded in getting it to "hand-shake" with b and g mode cards most of the time.  It would still randomly lose the IP requiring rebooting everything.  Not something my customer would accept nor would I sell.  Some of the techie specs are a long way from what Linksys claims. Linksys marketing obviously wrote the specs and ads then engineering tried to design to both.  They failed.  A non-techie spec important to everyone is range.  It has 20% the range of an old b mode Linksys router I had sitting right next to it.  Adding encryption dropped range in half again!  The wired router portion of it works out of the box, no adjustments required.  But you're buying this for the wireless function.  Yes, I could have tweaked some more and probably managed to get it stable enough to live with.  But Linksys didn't used to be that way.  I used to buy only Linksys considering my time worth too much to putz around with unreliable equipment to save my customers a few bucks on hardware.  This is the third Linksys router in a month (the other two were g mode) that have been unstable or DOA.   Then why did I buy this one?  It was on sale and I wanted to give Linksys one more chance before they lost my business for good.  They've now lost it for good.  I exchanged the router for a Netgear and it worked right out of the box into a network running both b and g mode wireless network cards.  Plus it was a lot less money.  Has Cisco ruined Linksys?  Got me.  Did all the good engineers cash out?  I wouldn't be surprised.  Are they rushing unfinished bug-filled product to market to meet quarterly profit numbers for Wall Street?  You bet!  I'll stick with Netgear and Belkin from now on.   
I ordered this cable and ended up sending it back to Amazon.  And I advised them why.  The THX 800 cable is not blue.  The THX 600 cable is blue.  I called Monster Cable and got hold of their technical support.  They said they have NEVER made a THX 800 cable in blue.  Amazon obviously has not followed up on this issue
The material and ergonomics of this phone is average.  The selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to 10 handsets using one phone line.  Below are the factors that I considered before purchasing and my experience:Range:  The range of the phone is very good.  I can be 80-100 feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop.Call Quality:  Average.  I have a Plantronics CS50 wireless headset that is on the 900 Mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit.  The call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear.  When I have switched during mid-conversation from the handset to headset, or vice-versa, callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call.  The Uniden is much more muffled and less clear.  It is however comparable to most cordless phone.  Not exceptional, but not bad.Durability:  Average.  I have dropped my handsets on rare occasions, they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well.  One of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor, which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it didn't scratch the hardwood floor.Special Note:  I suffered a power outage during a major windstorm.  The base unit will not boot up.  This appears to have happened to other reviewers.  This problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house.  On this issue, I have to drop my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars
The product shipped is not the same as the picture.  Apparently this is a common thing for this item. 
Terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features.  Pulls multiple papers through, so you must start again.  Is a G3, which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-G3 fax machines - WRONG - so you can't fax to 75% of the community that has a non G3 unit!  I thought I was buying quality from Canon when I paid $250 for this hunk of junk!  The cheap Brother and HP's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use, and much less expensive.  Save your money and save the headaches!  Sorry Canon, this product was a disaster
I think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine, is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder, and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax!  I especially got this machine because I thought it was a quality machine, and wouldn't do that, but I was wrong.  Sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating.  I would stay away.  It prints nicely, but it doesn't help if it ruins your faxes.  I see other reviewers have the same problem
I have always bought and liked Uniden phones.  Tried this one based on Consumer Reports recommendation and because I wanted caller ID.  AWFUL reception - too much background noise and you cannot hear the person on the other line.  Turn the volume to high and you get feedback from your own voice.  Good range (which is useful in finding the perfectly quite place in your house to finish your call!).  Stay clear!!!!!!
This is the worst phone that anyone could ever buy. there is constant static and clicking in the background, making it hard to hear the person on the other end. To make it worse it only has room for 10 programmable numbers and only two choices for ringtones, both obnoxiou
The range on this product is no where near what was advertised.  I purchased (2) units and neither will work consistently beyond 4-5 feet from mac.  Attempted to improve operation by relocating mac, using USB extension cable, and changing ID on transmitter with no improvement.  Extremely disappointed
I was very excited to try this product on my powerbook G4.. it worked the very first time.. but after a restart.. it no longer worked. was quite disappointed as i tried to reset it and try setting ut up again. it was fruitless. So I dont recommend this product as I'm truly upset with its performance
First I rated it great and it was, for two movies. Then it broke and the picture was scrambled and rolling. The end.
This transmitter requires me to remove the case from my iPod 5G.  Even with the case removed the device doesn't fit snugly and works it way loose as I am driving.  The sound is fair even though the area where I live has many unused stations.  I would think it would sound much better than it does.  Poor quality product; has too many flaws to justify the high price.  I'm very disappointed and I'm returning it
it's a super idea, but i cannot say it works well. getting a free station is a real challenge, even in the underdeveloped Italy. and if you get one, but you are driving, within 5 minutes (or 5 miles) you lose the signal... however the sound is perfect when you enter into a tunnel.is not good for cars, but works at home, connecting it to the radio. it needs to be improved
Waste of time. Software had some bugs but more importantly performance was horrible.  I wouldn't pay 10 dollars for this product- yes it is that bad.  Accuracy rate was about 25% and the mistakes were beyond spell check.  They look like some new form of reformed egyption. Don't buy!
Did not do what it says it does.  Only thing this does is remove large scratches.  No matter how many times you put this stuff on the small scratches are still.  Plus it leaves crusty white stuff on the disc and smears.  Not sure if discs are better before or after the application of this stuff.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Wait no you don't.  All I got was a jewel case, two pads, and two tiny packets of solution.  What a rip off.  Didn't even get a manual.  What kind of advertisement is this?  I know, the black market kind
I purchased this item on 6/3/06 from Amazon, and a 250GB ATA/IDE Hitachi drive to go in it from another vendor. It all went together fine and I could mount the volume easily enough.The first thing I noticed is that it's wi-fi wouldn't work with WEP with my Powerbook. It'd work without encryption on the Airport Extreme, but not with WEP or with WPA. I noted that and used it without the wi-fi for a few days. I noted it wouldn't hold time at all consistently. It wouldn't register a network time server's data and was always in the wrong time zone, so I had to fidge by seven hours to get it to match my time, but it would still drift about ten minutes per day, and then jump an hour or two randomly, making sorting which file is the more current a bit iffy.I found it slow to mount, and it would sometimes unmount over working WEP wi-fi or hardwired Gigabit connections, which was disheartening. I then decided to call Tech Support, which is when things went from bad to worse...Calls took a minimum 25 minutes to get through initial screening to tech support staff. The tech support staff were not familiar with the product and would transfer me around, which too up to another thirty minutes. Folks with extensions rarely answered or returned calls or e-mails. After *** 12 hours *** with customer support over two weeks and a not-yet-released firmware update, it would work with WPA_PSK or open, but still no WEP. They couldn't fix the time drift issue. I repeatedly asked for a replacement, but they always had a few more hoops to make me jump through, whether it be repeating a test for the upmteenth time, or another firmware update... they just wouldn't spare me the trouble and replace the unit until I was ready to scream. By this time, I was out of Amazon's return policy timeframe.They refused to give me a refund after repeated attempts. I even sent a letter, telling them to please send a refund check and not another unit or I'd post my experience here on Amazon. Of course, I got a replacement unit with no other reply.Now I've got to get rid of the thing oneBay or whatever, take the loss and move on. I would never buy another D-Link product. I would avoid this thing like anthrax - weaponized anthrax.I bought an Iomega NAS unit, which works very well, has multiple drives and RAID and, though it costs more, provides decent value and it WORKS.D-Link has a lot to learn about customer service and should NOT release beta, untested products to the consumer market. Shame on them
It says it supports Mac all over the package. However it doesn't support,  and cannot be made to support Mac  files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files. For instance, when I drag a folder over this icon to copy it starts copying until it comes to a file that has been named "ilegally" or uses a prohibited character. It says that it cannot copy this file and gives you the prompt "OK"?.  "OK" is your only choice to click on.  By clicking on  "OK" the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder.  How is that for compatibility? How is that for delivering backup assurance? I feel swindled.  The product has a geeky feel to it also with lots of acronyms an geek speak.  Mine will probably become landfill and be written off as an expensive education about doing more research than simply trusting the copy on the box. It's Mac compatible as long as you adopt PC conventions in how you operate your Mac.  Run Mac owners... Ru
I previously purchased a SIIG Firewire 800 Expresscard. After several weeks with SIIG tech support I'm told it is a known issue that card won't work with Dell laptops. So ... i phoned Belkin TechSupport before buying this card. They tell me they know of no such problems. Well, card gives exact same problem as SIIG! Works fine on Firewire 400 but the minute you use 1394b (Firewire 800) drivers, my Dell Inspiron 9400 bluescreens and reboots! Emailed and phoned Belkin tech support but no response/solution. From my experience, Dell Inspiron 9400/E1705's can't support Firewire 800.Update: after almost 2 months of trying to get a resolution from Belkin, they advise their product development team is "still working on the problem". Would I recommend buying a Belkin product, no way, that level of customer service is a disgrace
I didn't purchase this one...it was a gift. I was hoping for a laser printer like one of the Brother All-In-Ones.I opted to install the Lite version of the software from hp.com. I would suggest that everyone do this. The Lite version only has the drivers, none of the HP bull software that is included usually.The thing that bothered me the most was the Automatic Document Feeder. I would start a scan job and everything is going fine, and then on the 5th or 6th page the whole process would just hang. I had over 500 pages of documents to scan, and this machine really let me down.Amazing how Hewlett-Packard can't even write reliable drivers.I gave the item 2 stars because I got it to print sometimes. No buy
Installation: express install is over 200MB, full install about 650MB!!!It REQUIRES you to upgrade to Internet explorer 6 to continue installation (how it this related to printer installation, and what if I don't use internet explorer - I do not). Install takes forever, is memory hog, then tries to sign you up for some services. I used to like HP printers. I'm completely disappointed with the software to the point that I would rather have other printer than deal with this type of software.
Since we bought this to work with our Mac, we have had nothing but problems.  If asked to print one page of a document only, it freaks out, all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down!  Have had long sessions with HP customer service on the phone and they haven't a clue.  If we could have been bothered, we would have taken it back, but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages (at least we do recycle).  There are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash, can never work out specifically what, we just sigh and reset it.   Will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon
This printer sucks! It started out working wonderfully. Then all of a sudden (after the third month in use) it started printing very slowly. Then it decided it wouldn't print at all unless I completely shut down my computer everytime. Something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge. It also uses the color ink when it's not requested. I only needed the color ink a couple of times (not for pictures) and it went just as fast as the black. I used to love hp. They are now making garbage. I'm thinking of looking at the OKI brand. Don't waste your money on this one
After nearly two weeks, I'm still waiting for Kingston to ship out replacement ram. The ram was installed and after just one day, the ram caused several of the programs on my system to quit functioning.After calling Kingston several times, they still have not shipped the replacement modules yet. It's been two weeks.I would strongly consider a different brand next time. This company is not responsive.
I've had a 660 printer a couple of years and gone through 6 color  cartridges. Four of them had a couple of the jets clog after 1 or two  weeks. Running the head cleaner just wastes ink (a lot) without opening the  clogged jets. Then you have the choice of throwing away a $30 cartridge  you've hardly used or printing with gaps. I will not buy another HP  printer. I've wasted more on cartridges then the printer cost
I bought this cable, but it suffered from an unacceptable amount of interference. Faint green and purple rolling bands ruined my picture. Replacing it with a shorter cable fixed the problem.Don't buy a longer cable than you need, and consider spending a little more for a higher quality wire if you need all 50 feet
Despite careful aiming, this has exactly, and I mean exactly, the same signal strength as my cheapie $6 Airlink 7db omni, and is weaker than my homemade Pirouline cantenna. Probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap, but save your money if you're expecting 15db performance
I was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop.  Everytime I opened the lid a POPPING sound would occur.  Turns out the rear right back panel was rubbing the lid casing.  I took the laptop out and placed it back in thinking it was not properly installed, same issue.I'm not telling anyone not to buy this product.  Just be cautious.. and I hope you have better luck then I did
Have used many types of dvd-r. This the only one I have found that didn't have a record speed encoded in it and was unusable. Tried different locations on the spindle and the same results. Would have been a good buy if they worked. Gave it only one star because there was no 1/2 star
the alarms don't pay any attention to the settings in sounds and notifications. they repeat twice and then quit. the light doesn't flash except the first time. half of the time they don't work. i sent it back for repair and they didn't do a thing to it but send it back to me the next day. same problem, it is the way it is designed but they won't admit it
The 3M Privacy Filter does not work unless you are at a 50 degree angle or more to the screen. Otherwise you can see the screen. You can see the screen clearly from any distance if you are directly behind it. All the filter does is make the screen a little darker. Don't waste your money
As a musician who's dealt w/ opening many CD packages for many years, let me save you some money.  You don't need a special tool to open CDs.  Just run the bottom edge of the CD against any solid, rough surface (like a sidewalk or concrete wall) a couple of times.  The plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie, allowing you to take it off effortlessly.  Getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the CD off is easy, too.  Again, no tools required.  You'll notice that the CD cover is "hinged" at the top  bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back.  It just pops in  out, held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other.   Gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top  bottom, then bend the whole thing back, toward the top of the CD case where the sticker is affixed, so that the sticker becomes straightened out.  This will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece.  (Try peeling the front cover off the sticker, rather than vice versa.)  And you're done!  All you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy. The whole process takes under a minute, and you'll still have the money in your pocket that you didn't spend on an iffy CD opening tool, to buy another CD with
I'm using this in an area where, as usual, there is no map data for the trails and roads. Navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain, to known trails I've been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when I should have my chin up navigating. Even then, the functionality is very limited. Seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool, but so far it's only a novelty item. In order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded I will need to purchase the $100 Mapsend software which contains no useful data for me, only provides the functionality of editing/creating my own base map. A function I can only do on my laptop, something I usually don't carry out into the wilderness. Basically I bought this to use it to document my assaults on various ridges, passes, peaks and unknown road systems, while understanding my proximity to previously traveled routes to help me make progress. So far it's a 0/5 points in this department. If you want to find your way back to points this is useful, however for other types of navigation involving linear objects, such as trails and roads, waterways the software isn't there yet
I paid 300+ dollars for a NEW Magellan GPS less than a yearand a half ago from boat Us and they have already declared it obsolete. If you expect any support DO NOT BUY Magellan.
Anybody with a cheap pair of cutting pliers will be able to cut through the cable in seconds. I know because I just did it. The cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire. You could even use household scissors to gnaw through.Having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer. However, if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer, you might as well get something with a stronger cable
Bought my Go510 on November 14 as a Christmas present for the wife. It comes with only 90 days of warranty. Today is April 6 and the thing is broken. For a few days it had trouble finding the satellites, then just went dead. It was never abused, never left the car. Out of warranty for just 45 days, $600 wasted. It is junk! Stay away from it
Pen doesn't work as fast as I thought it would have. Very slow to upload text to computer. I bought this for a law student and it turns out to be more of a burden to scan and proof the text as you go. If you can type at a decent speed I would strongly discurage purchasing this product for note taking
These headphones have no bass whatsoever.  I would never buy these, please keep shopping as there are better products for the money out there.  The headphones that came with my MP3 player out of the box are WAY better then these
My job requires a KVM switch for QA purposes to test different OS/browser combinations.  In building the lab I decided to go with Belkin after researching various switches.  I'm configuring a lab with a Mac G4, Mac mini, NC6000 laptop and HP DC5100 mini tower.  I'm using the HP supplied keyboard and mouse, and a ViewSonic 19 LCD flatscreen.The first KVM worked well for right at 30 days.  At that point the mouse began to act erratic, followed shortly by the switch only working in the #1 slot (laptop).  I ordered a second switch and the same thing happened within 30 days again.I'm going to return the switch and try the well rated IOGear MiniView 4 Port USB KVW.
Followed the instructions to the letter.  PCs would not work once connected and even worse stopped XP starting up - had to go back to restore point.  Belkin email support is next to useless.  I would strongely recommend buying a KVM product from another supplier
Besides the fact you have to buy the cables separately as others have mentioned, Belkin support is horrible. The automated system consistenly disconnects the call, requiring going through their operator. My 4-port KVM stopped functioning after six months. There's no information on the web to help either. It's as if there IS no way to fix a KVM that doesn't work. Flash upgrading is a joke. I followed the procedure directly from Belkin's website. So I had to RMA replace it. Trust me, Belkin doesn't care about its customers and arrogance will be their downfall. Go with IOGEAR - they include all the cables with the KVM switch for the price of Belkin's without cables
I also was misled into thinking I was getting TEN of these tapes, not one.  While the tape is ok, it is absolutely not worth the price for a single basic VHS tape.  I am usually a big Amazon fan, but this advertisement is very poor
Agree with the prior message.  I was duped into thinking 10 VHS tapes were being sold.  DON'T ORDER THIS
The best thing about the Magellean 3000T is the large screen.  Sometimes this gadget works like a charm--other times it just seems to pay no attention.  Actually, the touch screen function decides not to work.  You can sit there and touch, rub, hammer; to no avail.  I got tired of the whole process and was ready to send it back to Amazon.  First, I called Magellan's help line (the phone number was hard to find); apparently you go to the diagonostic page and touch each touchscreen icon.  If you hear a click, it's okay.  Finally it works most of the time.  Damn bunch of trouble and frustration for a machine designed to reduce trouble and frustration. 
I agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download. In this day and age, there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers. A voice recorder is tool for on the go. So we should have to carry a CD with us as well in case we want to plug the recorder into a different machine? This is just a case of wanton disrespect of the customer by a big company
It's worth it just to take a regular size optical mouse with you. This one doesn't save that much space. It works fine, but it's not comfortable to use
Got the Archos to be able to take it with me when I travel for work and have movies on my flights.  The recording with the DVR station is great, but in order to hear what I recorded in a quiet room I had to have the volume turned up to 99%.  Hearing the audio with any background noise is impossible.  I contacted Amazon and got a replacement, that part was great, but the new one I have to have the volume up to 80% to hear anything in a quiet room.  I also found the that for the jack out to TV you are required to by the archos cable as it has a different pinout than a standard cable that comes with your video camera etc.  Needless to say, I will be returning the ones I have an buying another hoping it was just a bad manufacturing batch
This is my fourth Epson printer and probably my last.  The Epson RX580 needs several ink cartridges.  If ANY of them is out of ink, you can't print at all.  If you're out of yellow ink, you still cannot print a purely black/white document!!  The system should at least default to black printing when a color runs out.  I really resent that Epson is taking advantage of customers like that
 For those considering the purchase of this unit, keep in mind that only podcasts and videos will be displayed on your Tv. Menus and playlists will not.The very slight increase in video quality via the use of the s video cable isn't worth it. Get some 10.00 cables for your ipod and save  mone
I would love to try this. First one was shipped broken (make a clanking noise and woulnd't work). Sent it back and got a new one that didn't read a DVD.  I may try one more time.Its pretty heavy, but I am hoping the larger screen is better then other small portables or i-pod type machines
I purchased a Sony 5-disk CD changer in 1991 that could shuffle between all five disks. This model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time. What were they thinking? The ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs. a single disk CD/DVD player. THIS BABY IS GOING BACK
I had trouble with installing the firewire port. I did not get any help with the company.
I was not sent a firewire cable as was advertised.  They sent me a useless USB cable.  When I contacted the seller, they did not send me the proper cable.  Don't buy from this terrible company!
I bought the Archos 600 mostly for the picture- and video viewing and sharing ability - the large screen and good portability seemed ideal to share photos and videos with friends and family. The device didn't disappoint - also has coolness factor going for it with the sleek design and easy navigation.My opinion quickly changed when I ran into connectivity problems a few days into using it. While I was able to download and synchronize (via Windows Media Player) easily the first couple of times the device all of a sudden wasn't recognized as a USB device anymore and also froze the "external hardware" management function on my PC.  Right now I cannot even connect using it simply as an external hard drive, and so far customer service at Archos has not been able to help me, blaming the problem on driver issues on my PC (seems to defy logic - works fine first and then without warning stops), a  really frustrating experience. Seems like this is along the lines of problems that another reviewer experienced, so this may not be as isolated as I thought.
The picture is good and the combo was convenient.  However, after 1 year, the DVD broke.  Now I have just a TV.  This is the problem with combos.  It is better to get components separately
Poorly designed. I slide my 2400 into it and the case is so tight it pressess buttons on my iPaq for me. Turning it on in the case. Cheaply constructed. You can buy better for less. Check out the cases [...
So I really like this case besides the velcro.  Basically I have it with me all the time and use it frequently.  The only thing is that each time I take my hp ipaq 4155 out, the velcro makes the loudest noise I have ever heard and everyone looks up and stares at my case.  I wouldn't recommend this one... I am actually shopping for one that snaps or zips
I've been a BIG fan of MS keyboards and mice for years now, and the Desktop 7000 is the first huge disappointment.  I do love the design and the feel of the keys, but the keyboard is constantly issuing commands from the 'touch sensitive' areas when I don't even touch them (I type 120+ WPM).  In addition, the middle mouse button only fires 50% of the time, and the delay in the bluetooth is problematic for anyone who needs precision.  On top of that I began having USB stability problems when I started using their USB Bluetooth connector.  This is with Vista x64.  I've already returned one unit and am having the same problems with another, and will be returning it for a full refund.  Rumor has it MS is issuing a recall on certain units of this particular keyboard.Oh, and there's a bug with the IntelliType software that renders the pause/play button for media useless in Vista...Guess it's time to look for something else :
I bought this premium priced product because it has both built-in voice-mail and speakerphone. The latter was the key feature I sought. Well, it works intermittently, just enough so you can tell (occasionally) that it's "on" but infrequently enough that you can't actually use it to carry on a meaningful conversation. It reminds me of the "Can you hear me now" commercials. I'd rather live with Courtney than own this piece of junk one more day!All the other complaints from others are absolutely true as well.Ugh. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!
I bought 2 of these and they are horrible!  Youu put them in and they sometimes work and sometimes dont its such a pain in the arse!
I used this maybe 4 times when the "in" stopped functioning, but it mysteriously *would* work in reverse.  I wish I read other people's reviews on this before I bought it. Horrible waste of money
We purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house. With all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft. At first it worked like a charm, but then it suddenly started to jam up for no reason. We take good care of our electronic stuff so we were very surprised when the shredder stodecided to stop working. Then last week I added 2 sheets of paper and the shredder broke. Useless!!!
I placed an order for this Kingston memory stick only to have my order cancelled without explanation. Very lousy customer service
Beware of KINGSTON rebates!Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible.I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate.  I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way.  Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date.  My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer).The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1  business cards when flattened.  No problem.About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying "your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer."Well, now  WHAT?  I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession).  I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said.  I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase.After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam.  They simply wouldn't honor the rebate.  And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements.If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair.  If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk.For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products.Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices.Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced.I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams
My first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my HP Deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing. I replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all. While repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested, the etch tore. When examing the inside of the printer, I found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage.  The next new cartridge would not work either. $$ wasted.  Tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure (after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out). Printer repair would cost me more a new one
I was very disappointed in the Lexmark P450 printer.  The colors were very dull and the picture quality were definitely not up to the Lexmark standards that I am used to.  (I have several Lexmark products) I returned the printer
I ordered this, as I have many items from Amazon and had not received it after 2 months.  I cancelled the order
Received the product, it was not fully functional.  The buttons worked but the mouse would not track.  I loaded the software, trouble-shot everything, even put up with maddeningly insane questions from Kensington tech support ("Did you try unplugging it and replugging it back in?")  However, Amazon.com was very quick and gracious in the return.  Remarking on the design: seemed to fit well in my hand, though it was a bit bulky; usb cord was very long -- a desktop user would not have any issues with its reach; might have been an enjoyable product if it worked properly.I'm a bit disappointed, I was always a fan of Kensington products, starting with the 90s trackball.  I also have a cordless optical notebook mouse.  I've been seeking a replacement b/c it chews through batteries like none other.  So far I am 0-2 on satisfaction with Kensington mice
I have now been shipped two iSkins for my 60Gig, and both of them had the holes in the top in the wrong place. There are at least three flavors of 60 Gig iPods in the marketplace at present, and more coming, it appears, so be careful which one you order. The manufacturer's website is very confusing and unhelpful about identifying the correct model of skin, even if you know the model number of your iPod. I also agree with the other reviewer that the belt clip is a mistake. Throw it away.
I bought it, and USB was fine, but the FireWire ports didn't work.  Lost time and money sending it in for warranty service
I have a mouse intensive job with dual screens working on digitizing maps.  Unlike the reviewers before me I have a normal size hand.  Over the years I have developed a slight pain on the top of my wrist.  My favorite mouse so far has been a Microsoft Wireless mouse similar to the 5000 design but with the fake leather on the palm, which is no longer available.  I saw this "ergonomic" Natural mouse advertised on Microsoft's website six months ago and purchased one the second it became available.The mouse caused instant pain in my wrist.  I tried using the mouse for a week in different positions thinking I just had to get used to the mouse.  My wrist pain just got worse.  After a week the pain in my wrist was so bad I wasn't sure it would ever go away.  Not only did I have pain while using it but for days after stopping.  Although I have a mild pain in the top of my wrist from normal mousing this mouse caused pain in a different location at the base of my thumb.I returned the mouse and returned to my old mouse.
Sound wasn't too bad for price. Tinny yes, but cheap. Used it a dozen times and then started having trouble getting it to play CDs. And then it wouldn't turn on at all.
I have had this unit for just over a year.  Beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out.  Because of this design, it is prone to misalign the cd, which will either not load and the "no disc" warning will show or when it does play, there is a significant vibration.  To try to remedy this I had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit!  Alas, I just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime.  It is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a Sony.....By the way, the buttons are cheap and the overall construction is poor
worked for a month on and off and now doesent work at all.
I took the TV out of the box, plugged it in and nothing.  After pushing the on/off switch repeatedly, it finally came on.  Picture and sound were terrific so I was very pleased.  Turned it off with the remote.  Of course, the TV wouldn't turn on again with either the remote or the switch.  Pushed the switch about 10 times and it finally came on.  I called Panasonic customer service who could not do anything to fix it by phone.  So now my new TV is in for a warranty repair less than 24 hours after I received it.  Talk about frustrating!!
These actually left my screen dirtier than I started with. It left behind annoying streaks and film which I ultimately ended up having to clean off with my usual homemade solution. I suggest keeping a soft cloth with some 1:1 water and rubbing alcohol handy; it's cheaper and more effective
They clean the screen, so to speak, but also leave a slight film behind which can be seen when the monitor is off. It doesn't really affect viewing while the monitor is actually on, but I still don't like the fact that the screen is not completely clean after treatment. The monitor would have been cleaner overall had I just wiped it with a dry lint free cloth. Perhaps some people would view this film as a relatively minor flaw, since it doesn't affect picture during use, but regardless, I am extremely disappointed to pay money for a product specifically marketed as a screen cleaner with results anything other than excellent. I thought these would be a solution but they've turned out to be just another problem I have to figure out.
The cord design of these is terrible.  You'll have about 6 inches from the attachment point to your left ear and about 20 inches from  your right ear to your attachment point.  This is especially agravating for RIGHT HANDED individual (pshh hardly any of those).  Why is this an issue because it really is only not awkward if you hold your mp3 player (or whatever) in your left hand as the normal cord is too short.  I always use the extra extended cable, which makes the entire cable maybe a foot too big for ordinary use.The sound is good for the price (doesn't compare to my normal set of headphones), but sporadically I feel like they are hurting my ears (not in a physical sense).  I have a feeling this has to do with either improper wma encoding or (more than likely as I've never had this before with other headphones) improper sound design of the speakers.Question is though... would I spend the $30 amazon asks for them?   Yes, as they are definately the best in that price range, but don't go to Best Buy or Circuit City to get them as the price will be too high.  I expected more from Sony
I have used this _RW with my Sanyo DVD recorder. The result is that I cound not play the recording. It wil freeze up. and some times they can not be formatted. They will not function well if they are used for the VR mode. I have used other brands such as TDK or Fuji. they are OK.
This drive has a great aesthetic design, but did not work out of the box when I received it. Amazon delivered promptly as usual, but quality of this product is definitely lacking. Look at the Western Digital... that's what I now have and have had no issues.
This printer works fine as a USB printer, but it does not connect to a network. HP will not replace, says it must be something wrong with my network. Nevermind the 2 other printers, 2 Macs, and 3 WinXP computers connected to it. No more HP for me
Pros: Uses less batteries than the Space Shuttle... (6 AAs)Great idea gone to H*** quickly due to LACK OF PRODUCT SUPPORT! Apparently the person in charge of designing and marketing tapes for these units suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder and is totally unable to remotely consider any meaningful COMPLETE LINE of tapes. Red, blue,white pearl (paper?) - Yellow smiley faces. Green metalic. Black on clear - but no white on clear...There appears to be little, if any, hope for those who might actually like to COLOR CODE products in any single medium - plastic, paper, polyester, metallic,etc. Just whatever come to the designer's head is what's released. Five types here. Two there. One over here... No rhyme nor reason.Dymo has done themselves NO FAVORS HERE
I got this CD player because I thought sony was a good company, plus I liked the look of it. But after just 5 months after purchase, and not even using it that often, it has already broken. I paid about 40 dollars for this CD player, so I am very disappointed. If I were you, I would buy a different CD player

These headphones have a dececent sound but genuinely no noice cancelling effect.  The battery powers the speakers a bit which does make them a littel louder, but nothing special.  As you see, the price is down to $22.00 which is probably a good price for these (unfortunatly, I bought them at $50.00 and had to return them
Stylish, comfortable, good sound quality...and utterly useless at noise cancelation. Great for allowing one to conveniently eavesdrop on seat-side passenger conversations while listening to your favorite tunes, and you'll be sure to not miss any important safety instructions on your next flight. Perhaps there's a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box. I suggest you insist on this. Sure, turning on the noise cancelation sliding button would seem to somewhat reduce ambient noise, but as far as I can tell the only thing it does is slightly amplify the music volume.
I bought these today so that I could review an mp3 presentation.  As soon as I put the headphone on I wanted to take them back!  It has the most annoying buzzing sound.  What Philips means what they say "Noise Canceling" is that the buzzing sound will drown out all background noise!Well I'm taking these back
This little scanner is not worth the price. It's got a very limited user interface making it very slow and aggravating to use. There is no possible way to directly input a specific frequency, large gaps in between the frequency ranges it's programmed to receive, and very limited memory capabilities. The small display is hard to read unless you are directly in front of the device, looking from any angle and the backlit LCD display is unreadable. Reception of this scanner is poor on all of it's (very limited) bands, though can be improved with the use of an aftermarket antenna. The scanner is very prone to intermod from paging systems and other sources. The squelch is practically useless on this thing, it's either on or off, it seems that any setting in between full and open are pretty close to full, as it takes fairly strong signals to break the squelch even when it's set just above the static level on any empty frequency. The sound quality from the built-in speaker is tinny and shallow sounding, but at least there is a jack for an external speaker.On the bright side, the chassis is well built and strong, the buttons have a decent feel, not to light nor too stiff. The knobs turn with ease, but will not change their settings due to road vibration, they stay put where you set them at. The fit and finish of the scanner is actually quite good overall, but it's not enough to make up for it's lacking feature set and poor performance

I bought one of these about 3 days ago and it's already broken. I try to charge my ipaq1940 with the suggested tip and the adapter begins to continually reset my PDA. Not only that, but it drains rather than charges the battery. This is an extremely overpriced piece of junk, you'd be better off taking the large amount of money you would invest buying this product and consolidating whatever various devices you're trying to charge into one smart phone/pda/whatever that does everything you want
I travel a lot, especially to Europe, and hate taking lots of cables with me for the Vonage, router, laptop, cellphone and crackberry. The iJuice unit looked like a good idea.HOWEVER, the unit just failed during my trip, leaving me stranded and badly caught out with no back-up.  BAD IDEAA friend switched me on to charging everything via USB.  I just bought a cheap $5.00 USB charger for the Nokia, the crackberry charges via USB anyway, so I just needed to buy an ordinary laptop 110/240v adaptor  and I was all set. Laptop and nokia phone all charging away at the same time.Single point of failure is the laptop. However, Apple does a great universal adaptor (you can get UK./US etc plugs) with USB for charging Ipods for $20, all in one neat unit. You can just stick the USB for the Nokia in the back. Seriously, don't waste your money, unless you use more than one laptop or really need a particular tip you can't charge via USB. Using USB is far lighter, far more reliable, you don't loose the tips.
Either the item is faulty or my television is too old but it didnt work for me. I needed to use the component from vga to avoid taking up my s video and dvi openings on ym video card and the television never picked up the signal. Instead if you have a component open for video just use the s video converter not from this item.
this thing doesn't work, nothing but black and white image and off center.  my video card is ntsc like it said but won't work on the 3 computers i have.  don't buy this, buy a video converter box
I ordered several ink cartridges at one time and was appalled when I received a slew of large boxes to deliver my order. The increased cost of shipping the cartridges separately made one magenta cartridge go from $9.35 to $14.93. All the cartrides arrived within a day of each other. I would rather pay for one shipment rather than separate ones.
Why do I get the feeling that some of these later reviews were written by Kensington people? The fact is, this light has some unique features that most USB lights don't, including an On/Off switch and two brightness levels. However, that doesn't come close to overcoming the drawbacks.  First of all, the price is way too high for what you are getting. Also, the brightness difference between four and eight LEDs is negligible. But the biggest flaw in this light, by far, is that the flexible arm is not NEARLY strong enough to support the weight of the lamp. I have had to resort to clamping the arm to the side of my monitor, which is just plain ridiculous. For the price they are getting, they should have produced a more durable product
I bought this adapter thinking I would be able to print documents from my pocketpc. I installed the adapter to my 6300 hp printer only to find out that you can only print images. I was not completely satisfied with this adapter
I want to believe all of the positive reviews; I really do!  But at the moment I'm still having problems with the downloading and uploading of the firmware.  I know, I know:  do it in recovery mode!  Whatever that is!  (Don't worry, I've been to the site and followed the directions 20+ times!)And as for customer support...I got a message giving hours and "Good bye" ( I did called during the hours CS was supposedly open).  I had a MPIO and wanted something more reliable but once again find the software package and manual (so big and so little information!) are not intuitive or easy to use.  Maybe the Mac Nation is right.And as for that first review posted here on Amazon.com, I hope that guy got a bonus; he must be working for Cowan!Don
At first I loved the compact iAudio player, but after the first week, the earphone input (hole in the player), didn't hold the input jack securely, resulting in no sound.  I could jiggle it in the hole resulting in sound for about a second, but could not get it to work continuously.  Unfortunately, I threw away my receipt and box, or I would return it
It seems nice enough and it's cheap, but it is apparently incompatible with the Canon Powershot Digital Elphs. For use with those cameras, buy Sandisck instead. Seriously
The Cables To Go 4 port USB PS@ unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on. But I have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the KVM is not switched to that device. The video card goes into some blacked out video mode. The pc has to be shutdown. The box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error. The box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc. You must bo the port and watch the reboot. Then card is OK until next reboot unattended. Frustrating. The keyboard and mouse are OK. But with wireless keyboard/mouse combo, the box can not be on auto scan mode. Too many drawbacks
Not only was this difficult to set up (even a generally polite but sadly ill-informed technical helper from Belkin was baffled regarding the simplest steps and keyphrases) but once I finally managed to get it to work (by simply as a last resort resetting the router with a paper clip) it had practically no range whatsoever; in fact, my MacBook Pro placed within 2 inches of the router itself only received a 75% signal, and once the threshold of the room was crossed, the signal disappeared altogether. A free four-year old Linksys router which I received with my Earthlink "home networking" package (and which this Belkin was supposed to replace) always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed, and Linksys is supposed to be notoriously Mac-unfriendly. Anyway, I hope that there are enough UPS trucks in America to handle the returns that this item -- mine included -- will require.
Having had very good luck with two Belkin G routers, I thought that the G+ would be a no-brainer. NOT. First of all, the router would not install at all from Windows 2000. I called customer support, and after interminable waits and two tech support people (who were very polite), we finally decided to install from another computer with Windows XP. All seemed to be going along fine--the router installed--but did not allow me to set a security password for the wireless in the regular set-up process like their G-router setups did. Only when I logged on wirelessly, it let me set a password----meaning had any of my bandwidth-thieving neighbors tried to log on before me, it would have been THEM setting MY password (which would have effectively locked me out of the wireless!). It also came without a user's guide (though that is listed on the box contents) and the CD-ROM also was supposed to have a user's manual, but when I clicked on the "user manual" tab, nothing came up! After all was said and done, I did manage to get my XP system connected, but the Windows 2000 would not connect even with a cable (it was working fine on a Linksys direct cable before). Overall--a very painfully long installation that was not Windows 2000-compatible (or perhaps a firewall problem), items left out of the package, and a big step down in ease of installation from their G router. And if that isn't bad enough--the signal strength was no improvement over the Linksys G router I was replacing. Belkin, sorry--this product was below your previous standard. This one's going back to Best Buy
I wanted some earbuds for my Zen player which fit in my ears and wouldn't fall out. These earbuds did fit my ears. However, a month after starting to use them one channel went out and now I have sound coming out of only one earbud. Also, I have no idea why these are called, "high quality" earbuds, unless it was a sales tactic. The sound quality is not as good as the sound of the original Zen earbuds. I am back to using the original buds, but I'm $20 lighter in the pocketbook. I was dissatisfied with this purchase
I bought this Samsung model in September because of the superior picture and excellent glare reduction.  It went black the day before the Super Bowl.  It is now NCAA playoffs and it has not been repaired or replaced. The service technician has tried 3 times to repair, now having replaced every component.  I am finally on a replacement list with no ETA.  The Samsung Customer Service reps have been unhelpful and unconcerned.  The repair technician is the only person who has apologised and tried to push Samsung - with no success
I bought this unit for my wife and we received it this week. It works great. When I registered the unit on line I found that Magellan's website showed there were software updates for this unit (Roadmate 2000). I downloaded the update and after some difficulty I was able to perform the upgrade. I then found that the voice prompts no longer worked. I logged back onto their webpage and found that the firmware upgrade had been removed due to a technical issue they are working on to correct. I verified all of my settings and finally called Magellan support. The support group was hard to understand (they are located in India) and were unable to help me. I asked if this was a problem related to the upgrade since the voice prompts worked fine before the upgrade and they would not say. They asked that I upgrade the unit again (although the screen showing the firmware and OS versions showed the new version numbers) but by this time I was low on battery charge and could not perform the upgrade. This unit did not ship with an A/C adapter. I asked if there was a way to backout the upgrade and he (Tom) informed me there was not. I asked the tech again if this was a known issue and what other issues I might experience with this "upgrade" and after some time on hold he once again was evasive and would not answer my questions. I asked for a supervisor and after some more time on hold he told me one would call me back within 24 - 48 hours. I was not happy with this and said that was unacceptable to which he put me on hold some more after I told him I thought 1 to 2 hours is more along my expectations. He came back and said a supervisor would call me back in an hour. It is well over an hour and no call so far. I tried their Corp office and was routed by an ARU back to India. I called their Corp office again and after attempting the dial by name directory got to a receptionist named Marti who would not connect me to management. She said she would send me to Quality Assurance and they could escalate to management if necessary. I spent about 15 minutes on hold and was finally disconnected. I love the Magellan GPS units and I have three (Blazer 12, Explorist 210 and the Roadmate 2000) and each time I have had to call tech support I am very disappointed. I have to say I will not recommend their products to anyone else since I am really getting the impression they are disconnected with their client base and provide at least some answers. To be fair Tom (tech support) did say the updated firmware will be out within a weeks time. However, until then I have a nice map on a video device with no audible prompts whatsoever. If my wife was not already used to the unit I would pay 100 bucks more and get something by another manufacturer. In summary be careful with firmware upgrades and don't expect good customer service if you need Magellan's help.
This wireless speaker system failed to work right out of the box. However; I had not problem with the return , which included return postage. I will purchase from Amazon again
I've owned three of Interlink's units, but that was before  competitors came to market with well-designed units. The Interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily;  there is no OFF switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one's pocket; the advance and go-back buttons function most of the time, but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least 2-3 times per 30 minute presentation.  Although I agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this Interlink product better than I do, it seems these other reviewers have not compared the Interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features. For example, the Kensington pointer is half the price; the case is sturdy, has a no-slip outer coating, has a comfortable feel in the hand, and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use.  Placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip.  And the advance and go-back buttons function all of the time, not just most of the time!   
I bought the version of this cable with the audio pair for an outrageous $60 at Circuit City out of dire necessity. I have never liked Monster Cable because they use physics mumbo jumbo and deceit to market some seriously overpriced cables to unthinking consumers. I opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection. At their usurious price point, I find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore I would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations. Thanks to Circuit City's return policies, I was able to return this junk and get my money back. Caveat emptor - cable buyers - spend your money wisely and stop the Monster Cable insanity
Purchased a total of 20 of these. I previously sold the American International brand Sirius antenna but there was a temporary shortage in the market.Four of the twenty Terk brand units were dead on installation. Sadly, I thought Terk was a quality brand. My mistake!
I own one of these, it came packaged in my Dell XPS Renegade. Sound in a Windows environment is good, as indicated by other reviews. But in a gaming environment for example World of Warcraft, and not just this game, I and other user's have experienced the squeal of death, wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal, and may hard lock your computer. Either way this can only be corrected by rebooting. Check out the forums before buying any creative labs products. BUYER BEWARE!
This cd storage unit isnt the greatest cd rack but if you want something that will do the job and isnt too costly this is the thing for you.  it is made from plasti
This tv only worked for three weeks.  Then, for no apparant reason, it suddenly would not turn on.  I sent it back to Coby for servicing and they sent it back still broken and with a new crack on it.  No one should by from Coby
I bought this as a backup drive several months ago for my home business after the iomega backup drive I was using crashed and took my backup with it.  The Maxtor software installs automatically when you plug in the drive so that part was really easy and it took just a few minutes.  The initial backup was really easy and went pretty fast too.  So far, so good.  The problem is that once the initial backup takes place the backup function doesn't backup new or updated files! The scheduled backup doesn't work at all.  The light flashes so you think it's working but it doesn't backup ANY new or updated files.  The synch is useless too.  It's like the backup function.  It will synch your files one time but then after that it doesn't synch any of your new or updated files like it's supposed to.  It's like it takes a snapshot of your computer at a specific time and that's it. To get around the fact that it won't automatically back up my files I have to manually transfer my files every few days or so which is a real pain as I have to remember what files have been updated and/or are new.I would NOT buy this product again.  It's not an automatic backup drive, it's just an external drive that will back up one time but then isn't reliable AT ALL.   If you need a backup drive look elsewhere. Sorry to say, this one is a complete waste of money.
I just got it and am fighting my way through getting it to work in Vista Ultimate. It claims to have a QAM tuner, but I'll be damned if it can find any digital/HD channels on my cable. My QAM TV gets many. Very disappointed, documentation is at best lacking. Look elsewhere.
Functions absolutely flawlessly under Vista 64bit (unlike most other cards such as my older WinTV PVR-150).  If not for the next paragraph, I'd give it five stars for just this.  Heck, it does better under Vista x64 than my old card did under WinXP 32.  (Disclaimer: I tested the analog video only, not the digital.) But I discovered that it was running extrememly HOT, even when just sitting their idle.  So hot that you literally can't even touch it.  Ouch!  I ended up removing it from the case as I didn't trust it. Perhaps it's a vista driver issue in that the driver is not card go idle even when it's not in use.  Emailed tech support but they offered no real answer other than it shouldn't be warm at all
Very clear image! Probably the best that I saw on this kind devices! No software availble. Device is useless if You do not have Windows Media OS. Absolutely no Linux support. Good hardware... but useless...You have to buy software for ~$70-120 to be able use it...
Along with reception of new HD stations I expected high quality FM  AM to go with my complete top line stereo system. Instead, the HDT-1 gives me very poor quality, even less than a table-top clock radio. Very high output - can only turn amp up to lowest level - and painful to listen to. No response to inquiries from Sangean.
I loved these earbuds for 5 weeks, right up until they stopped working.  The wires to the iPod (the stationary wires, not the ones that wind up) disconnected or broke inside the retractable casing.  For a while it worked if I taped the cord so it pushed the wires into the case.  But quickly stopped working altogether.Too bad, they're comfortable, the sound is fine (great on the bus), and the retraction works good. 
I bought this router hoping that some of the quality in Cisco's excellent enterprise-market routers would have worn off on adopted child Linksys.  Unfortunately, my experience has me convinced that Linksys is a red-headed stepchild (my apologies to all you red-heads) who has learned very little from its adoptive parent.That being said, the router does work out of the box, and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home-network routers.  My perusals of the DSL reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub-$300 routers on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies, and this one is certainly no exception.Pros:This router is configured to work right out of the box.  You can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on, and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen.The HTML-based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use.  You don't have to learn one single command line to configure this router.Default configuration was stealth mode -- meaning the router did not respond to _any_ unsolicited connection requests, forming a protective "black hole" on my IP for most uninvited packets.Cons:Not all of the features worked out of the box.  Several of the links in the HTML command pages simply did not link to anything.  Strange that Linksys would ship the firmware without at least taking 30 minutes to hide the links that don't point to anything.Turning on the poorly documented "firewall" feature causes the router to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests.  Sometimes the router responds "port closed" to all requests.  Sometimes it responds "port closed" to some and "port open" to others (the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next).  Never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration (with "firewall" inactive).  I'm not sure how the "firewall" in this router is configured to behave, but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature.The router's DHCP functionality works great -- when it works.  It mysteriously disengages at random intervals, requiring a reboot (and sometimes a flash to factory defaults) to remedy.Flashing a new BIOS image is risky; router failure during a flash means shipping the router back to the manufacturer - or File13, if the warranty is out.For what it's worth, I am still using this router.  It serves its basic purpose, and while its functionality issues are annoying, there are workarounds for all of them.  I probably will not buy another Linksys, but the problems with this one aren't annoying enough to warrant a return.-sean hennin
As you may have read elsewhere, this router has a problem with the GRE protocol used by Microsoft for their PPtP server (see Alan Bryant's May 27, 2004 review).This will stop you using it with the built-in PPtP VPN client/server which is provided with Windows 2000/XP.Here is the text of a complaint I have submitted to Linksys..."I am attempting to operate a Microsoft PPtP server behind a BEFVP41 (firmware 1.41.1). I have PPtP Pass Through enabled and port 1723 forwarded to the fixed IP address of the server but the router refuses to pass the GRE protocol used by Microsoft (Protocol 47).In answer ID 737, you suggest forwarding port 47 presumably in a belief that this has something to do with GRE. It does not and is therefore not the solution to this problem. GRE does not use TCP/UDP port 47, it is 'Protocol 47', something entirely different.It seems that the the writer of answer 737 has neither tested this scenario nor has a true understanding of the nature of this problem.I and others have investigated this problem extensively using protocol analysers at the client and server ends and can only conclude that the present version of firmware in the BEFVP41 (1.41.1) is incapable of handling the GRE protocol correctly.Can you please advise when a fix will be implemented? This is seriously devaluing an otherwise good product.I also suggest that you amend answer 737 as it is misleading and will frustrate others less versed in IP protocols than myself."I await a reply from Linksys as I write this review.Having said all that, if you have no interest in running the Microsoft PPtP server, the BEFVP41 may do everything else you require. It functions okay as a basic NAT router and it's stealth capabilities are good (Steve Gibson's 'Shields Up' reports 'True Stealth' as long as you forward port 113 to a non-existant host).The in-built IPSec tunneling works well. I am using one to provide permanant tunnels to a number of BEFSX41's very reliably.The web interface is a little odd at times but it does do the job reasonably and you do get used to it eventually.To summarise:A reasonable basic NAT router.Very good stealth.IPSec tunneling works okay (at least to other Linksys products).Microsoft's PPtP server will NOT work with the current firmware version.  
I bought a pair in January and loved them. Sound is as lovely as everyone describes. However, there are something seriously lacking in the build quality. The soft wires felt flimsy to me when I first opened it, but I thought I'd just take extra care. At 1 month of careful usage, the plastic-covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened that I could almost use them as chopsticks, and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion. At 2 months of careful usage, the wires had half-ripped from the plug--which I repaired the best I could with unsightly electrical tape. However, at 3rd month, the left bud fell completely off. I am very disappointed--it is one of the best-sounding phones I've ever had (I've owned both Grado s60 and s90, and sennheisers), but man, they need to do something about making this baby last
The card works and produces a reasonable image, but the "Catalyst" software used to drive the card is lacking/buggy.  To make work, I had to disable the SCSI CD burner in the system (or the software would hang for several minutes before working).  The sofware is slow to open/respond, beyond that the ability to size the TV window is very limited.  This card replaced a standard TV card in my system that I bought for $25.  I used the old card more because it would open quickly and I could resize the window to be small (non intrusive) while I was working on other things.  On the plus size, I can expand the HDTV card to larger windows while retaining a good image
Heres the thing about batteries. They eat people. Yeah. You can never trust a battery, cause those things are HEARTLESS. Especially Rayovac... those give me the creeps. *Shudder* So the next time you think about buying batteries, think about B.E.P.-Batteries eat people. Dont even think about it, punk
I bought the Zune around Christmas time of 2006. I used it on a daily basis and was happy with it. Early in April, it stopped working. After spending three (3) hours on the phone with four (4) technicians, Microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility. Two (2) weeks later, I received the Zune back with a note that the Zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations. They did not tell me what the problem was - only that they did not fix it. I was more then dismayed. I had spent almost $300.00 with tax and shipping to buy this product. I did not abuse it in any way. Please think twice before buying this product. If and when it breaks - Microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a $300.00 paperweight.
The suspicious side of me wants to believe that HP did a promo with their Deskjet 612C - i.e. they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements.  I would be surprised if there is any difference between the 612C black replacement cartridge C6614 and the much more common cartridge for the 660C other than a little plastic tab on the cartridge case
Let me start by saying I was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going.  I imagined myself able to locate the kids when we tried to meet up, or find them if we got lost (or god forbid worse).  I bought two from Amazon and bought two more from a local retailer while waiting for the Amazon order to arrive.  I took my girlfriend's niece out for a practice run to see how they all worked...five minutes later mine locked up.  I went and found my niece..."Uncle XXXX, why does the screen look all funny"  The units from the local retailer had a problem with the screen locking up...so I exchanged them, but then, so did the two I got in exchange.  I thought perhaps I got a bad batch from the local store, but when the Amazon units arrived, they had the same problem.  We took them out for a stroll with some friends from MBA school...the unanimous opinion after a few minutes of test use by late 20 year old and early 30s self proclaimed gear lovers..."dude, these %!".Forget, locating the people in your party, even if all your friends are incredibly patient geeks.  (I should know, I was so excited when I ordered the radios that I applied immediately for a GMRS license with the FCC).  The Rino 530's simply don't work well.  A combined GPS and family radio seems like such a great concept for a product, but at $400 a unit, they are pathetic.  $1600 for four units bought me disappointment, frustration, trips to the store and time on the phone with customer service agents who act surprised that there is a problem.  Frankly, the GPS is useless because the screen flips out every seven minutes.  You have to stop, remove the belt clip and take the battery off the back and reboot...then it happens all over again a few minutes later.  The product becomes a real distraction instead of an enhancement to your outdoor activity...You wind up thinking how great it was when you had $20 radios that worked.I spoke with three Garmin reps who denied they knew of any problem, one told me it was a complicated piece of equipment and occasional crashes were to be expected.  Every seven minutes?  Come on, Windows 95 was more stable than that.  Finally, I got a guy on the phone who said, "Oh yeah, there's a problem with the 530's, you should avail yourself of the local return policy if you can.  If not we can send you some more, but I can't make any promises."  He explained that they are having an issue with the electric signal to the LCD and said they are trying to develop a firmware solution.  Reading the other reviews, I'd guess they've been unsuccessfully working on one for more than a year now...and through multiple software releases.  I am not holding my breath for working a firmware repair.  I've certainly bought products that had bugs and got better with firmware releases (Linksys routers for instance, Palm Treo's) but this is no $50 router, (or generally stable $400 phone) and frankly, I have to reset my router once every four months at most.  This product is really bad, I wish it were better because the concept is great, but I would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to keep your money and save yourself the headache.
I'm not the most gadget inclined person, and this was given to me as a gift because it was easy to install and use.  But I have to say I've had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out - it's either OFF or ON, but there's not much gradation between the two.  In fact I get almost no gain at all until I reach almost the "3:00" position on the dial.  And then it's a LOT, and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation.  It basically keeps me locked into soft, close singing, and a girl can't do that all the time!  Other than that I haven't had any problems, but that one almost renders it useless.  I don't know if there's something more reliable (and sane) out there, but if there is, go for that instead.  Even if it costs more.  Why spend money on something that doesn't work
Buyer beware! Item was shipped with a short in the electronics and had to return. Even though item clearly states that "this is not returnable", I returned it anyway, only to receive more problems. Stay away from this. I am refuting the credit card charges and plan on winning this one
I purchased this to replace my 10 year-old Bel 846i, and was really disappointed.It is difficult to tell in the picture, but the portion of the detector that appears light grey is actually kind of silver. On its own, I wouldn't particularly like the color scheme, but what makes the design terrible s that the shiny silver reflects on your windshield. I can't believe they'd think this was a good idea. For some reason, I was getting false laser alerts like crazy -- empty subdivisions, on the expressway without a police car in sight, parking lots... At first, I thought my phone might be interfering with the detector, but I was getting just as many falses with the phone turned off.I'd expect this with a Cobra detector that cost half as much, but this is pretty terrible. Based on other reviews, I don't think this is isolated to a defective unit.
I bought this because I wanted a cheap no-frills phone with answering system, but it's performed very poorly compared with the one I had previously.  Specifically, it's very hard to hear anything on this phone, even with the volume set to maximum.  Definitely not worth buying
I bought the C. Crane FM transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an FM tuner with headsets as I worked around the house and yard.  It broadcast 5 or 6 feet, max, out of the box.  I performed the power boosting "fix" and now it broadcasts 10-20 feet, if I'm lucky, before static overpowers the signal.  This was a disappointing purchase directly from C. Crane that in no way met my expectations.  If it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities, build it that way from the get-go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly.I kept the transmitter because I wanted one for the car.  It's physically well built and works fine for that.  I also use it to play my Ipod through a radio...but, understand, the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter.  If you want to transmit throughout your house and yard, look elsewhere
I purchased this item per other recommendations and that of Stereophile magazine, thinking that this would be useful for broadcasting iTunes and internet radio programming to other parts of my home.First, reception was terrible even with the reciever placed only a few feet away from the Transmitter.Second, I tried the tweak (turning up the volume pot)suggested in other ratings.  This didn't help matters from a reception standpoint, in addition, the unit is so poorly constructed that the mere act of opening it dislodges the volume potentiometer. Third, the volume pot itself is of very poor construction.  In short, it doesn't work, you won't be happy--even if you attempt to "fix" it yourself-- don't buy this product
expecting big sound and good FM station reception, buy something els
Don't buy these batteries, because they don't last long like Energizer or Duracell. These Eveready batteries ain't never ready
These batteries didn't last at all. They worked OK in my remote control for my radio, but on everything else, the quality was either below-average or just horrid. My digital camera didn't even turn on with these. Only recommended with low powered devices; actually I'd recommend a Rayovac or an Energizer rather than these. I know they're only heavy duty batteries, but the quality is still below-average
The overall construction of the pedal is pretty sturdy aside from the fact that most of it is made of plastic.  The sound it produces ranges from a hard overdrive to the hariest shreding distortion. The pedal deminishes tone quite a bit and doesn't have a very good range (very high notes are not processed correctly and deliver poor results).  not bad for the money but not an investment in the least bit.  i just got this because i had a gift certificate that i wanted to get rid of, otherwise i would not have purchased the item
   For the first few weeks it worked fine, however, it started skipping and stopping DVDs after two months. I called customer service on 85th days after original purchase date and been told to send the unit for replacement since it was still under warranty, no case number was given at the time. The unit was shipped via UPS and received on 92nd days from the purchase date, and they charged $50 for warranty service since it was received two days after warranty expired. I called customer service again and the representative declined waiving charges because I don't have case number issued within warranty period. In addition, please keep in mind that their service fee includes returning handling and shipping fees as well. Next place for my DVD player? Trashcan *sigh*   Go buy another brand with 1 year warranty unless you purchase extended warranty along with this unit.Pros:   Cheap   Dual screen   Comes with gaming pad   Detachable screens which is very easy to use.Cons:   Sub LCD screen isn't sharp as main, I thought it was defective for the first time.   All the games are outdate
but 20 dollars more and hideous. I have a platinum Intuos2 tablet (a high school graduation present from 2004), and when I broke the pen, I ordered the regular intuos2 pen due to it's being slightly cheaper on Wacom's site. Here, the platinum is 20 dollars more (and in my opinion, much uglier). I recommend buying the classic intuos2 pen
Product arrived damaged.  Company (ANTOnline)was unwilling to exchange for new item.  Would never buy from them again
Got it in December; CD player stopped working in April and now the radio reception is so bad I'm tossing it.  Can't provide paperwork for refund as it was a gift
This makes no sense. If the industry standard is 4x6, why did they, Kodak, cut the paper to 4x6.5 and then advertise on the carton that it is 4x6 -- yes, I see the fine print on the back side of the carton that reads "actual paper size is 4x6.5"I still don't understand why they did this.  Now I have cut the pictures down to the correct size...what a waste of my time!!!!!!!!!!
Pro ---* Compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket, yet opens to a comfortable working size with full-sized keys, including a number row. For those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets, this is decidedly a deal-maker over the Stowaway keyboard which requires alt-key combinations to access numbers and symbols. The full-size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the Freedom Keyboard.To my knowledge, there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has *both* full-size keys *and* a number/symbol row.* The bluetooth connection is clean, lag free, and accurate. Con ---* The software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome, requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use, and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement (see below).* Flimsy Locking Mechanism / Not Usable on a Lap. The manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat "while on your lap or on a non-flat surface".This "lock" is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip, which travels 7/8" along the top of the board from the left half into the right.Even when locked, the keyboard doesn't lay flat, and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user's legs, held in place only by one thin piece of wire, the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated "V" shape after any amount of light-handed typing. HP could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics. A user must find a solid flat surface to type on, such as a book. And of course, when sitting on a flat surface, the lock isn't needed. * The manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to "enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your...PocketPC". Unfortunately, the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non-removable cradle.A quick look at the Freedom Keyboard's pull-out cradle offers HP a lesson in how to do it right. * The keyboard ships with no case, as do most other portable keyboards with non-rugged exteriors. The attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys.* It doesn't turn off.Yes, you read that last bullet correctly: You can't turn this thing off. There's no power switch. The button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld; it's not a power switch.What this means is, even when folded and not in use, even when appearing to be dormant, and even when the software shows that there's no bluetooth connection,  the keyboard is still eating your batteries. The automatic "sleep mode" simply disables the wireless connection; it does not power down the keyboard.Two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard, you'll return to find them dead. Not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes.The only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries. The battery cover, need I add, breaks easilly.Sound unbelievable? Go to the major websites dedicated to PocketPCs, and do a search of their forums using the keywords "bluetooth keyboard". This is not a case of a know-nothing customer who needs to read the manual. The manual, such as it is, makes no mention of an absent power switch.For the mobile user then, in addition to the keyboard itself, one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on, to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired, to carry the batteries separately, and to re-enter the access key into the software after reinserting those  batteries.Although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket, the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user. Add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use, the HP iPaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1/3 it's $100 retail price, and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full-size keys and number row.How HP ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me.All potential buyers of iPaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what, if any, emphasis HP places on quality of design and the integrity of iPaq name. It reflects also the degree of respect HP has for the intelligence of their customers. One might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non-removable cradle, or the parsimony of not including a case. One might even forgive the useless locking mechanism.But when HP is either too dumb to include an on/off switch, or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care, then I must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the iPaq name. If HP is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for $100, then I cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a PocketPC for $300-400. My next handheld upgrade, I'll probably stay with Fujitsu-Siemens Loox (I currently use a Loox720, a truly excellent PPC), or maybe go with a Dell Axim. I won't even consider an iPaq. The HP Bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality. Those at HP responsible for protecting public perception of the iPaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves.
I WAS VERY UP SET THIS WALKMAN WAS A GIFT. IT COST $90.00 6 MONTHS AGO. IT DID NOT WORK RIGHT I COULD NOT GET GOOD RECEPTION AT ALL IT WAS COMPLETE STATIC ON ALL STATIONS. I THINK IT WAS DEFECTIVE BECAUSE I ALWAYS BUY SONY PRODUCTS, AND THEY WORK GREAT I STILL HAVE THE WALKMAN MY GRANDMA GAVE ME 11 YEARS AGO AND IT STILL WORKS. BUYER BEWARE DON'T BUY WALKMANS FROM AMAZON ON LINE. I SUSSPECT AMAZON MAY HAVE SOLD ME SOMEONE'S RETURN ITEM. ALTHOUGH I CAN'T PROVE IT. YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF GOING TO TARGET OR BEST BUY. IN CASE A REFUND IS NEEDED. SHOPPERS CHECK ALL YOUR PURCHASE'S WITH IN A 30 DAY PERIOD SO YOU WON'T GET STUCK WITH SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT WORK. IF I DID THAT I COULD HAVE GOT A FULL REFUNDGOOD LUCK FRIEN
I put this paper on the wall in my office next to a picture printer on Epson Heavyweight matte paper and the glossy roll picture was yellow in a little over a month.  I will never buy this paper again
Well I got these headphones and connected them and realized when it played the front center channel i only got sound from the front left speaker. Then the rear right channel didn't work at all. After calling tigerdirect to see about a refund. The first customer service rep was Rude and unwilling to help. Said we had to ship it back to them in the orginal big brown UPS box with all the extra millions of packing peanuts. After getting the management on the phone they were more willing to help but its not enough.  The headphones feel cheap and the wires are not color coded like everyone else uses. the instructions are lacking and the speakers that did work in them didn't sound that good at all
I bought this mouse hoping to use it with my new HP dv2000 laptop, with internal bluetooth, I was excited about the Instant View feature and the lazer percision, however when I got the mouse connected it worked, but no instant viewer?  Turns out the instant viewer only works if you have the DONGLE pluged in... but... the reason I bought a "BLUETOOTH" mouse was in order to AVOID a dongle breaking off in the side of my laptop.On top of all this the extra two buttons on the sides are AWKWERD to press, I have to contort my fingers in a arthritus inducing cramp to press them, nothing like my old microsoft mouses' cozy side button.The middel mouse button also is annoyingly resistant to press in order to activate mouse button three... which is set to activate the "Amazing" instant viewer, which is decent, but useless without the dongle.As far as lazer percision, not too noticable, my Kingston RF lazer mouse seemed to preform better.The only reason I gave it a 2/5 is the charger is nice, the battery is good and it has a nice brushed aluminum finish, which feels nice and cool against the palm.This makes a DECENT desktop mouse, if you use the dongle which they include the connectivity is good and the percision is nice.  Not something I'd recomend for a laptop user.  For the price overall subpar
Despite the claim that both units take AA batteries, the unit we recieved takes 9V Batteries.  That is somewhat annoying because one of the reasons we bought this model was because of the AA battery usage as advertised.  Will review performance when we've had a chance to use it.  
I have owned this monitor for a little bit over one year and it died on me right after the one year warranty expired. The customer services rep told me that it will be $110 for a repair which I can almost buy a new one if I pay the shipping on top of that $110. I have other eight (8) LCD monitors in the house and no one has such a bad quality. I'll newver buy any Proview products ever. I will give zero star if there is one
I bought this drive in late 2003, and it's gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then. The positives first - though it has an 8MB buffer it is very fast, and can even stand its ground against some newer disks with larger buffers. It does make quite a bit of noise and heats up a bit more compared to my older 40gig and 20gig WD's, and the newer seagates. 2.5 years after purchase, the drive started corrupting files like crazy. WD has tools on their site to check your disk status, and sure enough it was due for an RMA. When I checked the warranty status online, 6 months had mysteriously 'vanished' from my warranty period. The drive warranty had started 6 months before I'd purchased it! Anyway, it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick.Still, this is my second WD drive to die, and I'm going with other brands from now.
I just bought a 25 pack of these along with my new liteon dvd burner.  To bad only half of the cd players in my house can even read them.  I dont' think its the lightscribe side thats causing the problem as it doesn't seem to matter if I "lightscribe" them or not.The burner works fine with all of the other media I've tried so I'd avoid these discs like the plague
I use to Love Maxtor. Still Have one from 1999. so got this box hoping it would be a flexible way to go between two computers. Well, The darn thing crapped out within two months and all the data was gone. I did have a lot of it backed up but still, what a pain. Now that Seagate owns them, spend a few bucks more and get a seagate drive. OR get a couple of these and RAID them. but sending the thing back to get it exchanged is a pain and you are out over 30 bucks in shipping
This item is absolutely worthless, don't waste your time! I'm returning mine to Target tomorrow. There are laws against false advertising, I don't know why they're not enforced.I will never buy ANYTHING made by Belkin again.
I bought one of these when I bought my Macbook to keep it in pristine condition, just a few months ago.  I just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the Macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my Macbook.They should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the Macbook of a softer material, or created a design where it won't rub against the laptop.Really stupid design.  It may have protected against some very minor scratches,but likely I'm worse off for using this cover (scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity). I don't think in the long run it was worth $40, and I feel very misled by the marketing for this cover.  Given the choice again I would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money
And also gave my children an amusing exhibition of what it was like to try to tune in a station on a TV circa 1963.  Pulled in weak signals from about 3 stations 18 miles from NYC broadcast towers.
This product only works properly if you have a phone line and are using skype.  Do not use this product if all you plan to use is skype, it does not react well to this scenario.  But, if you are looking for a way to get cheap long distance for your existing phone service this is a great device
A Nightmare! Don't buy from Electronics Expo! The 1st Sharp 52' LCD TV was late, had a smashed HDMI  4 dead pixels.  The replacement TV had even more dead pixels  Electronics Expo, Sharp, Amazon  Visa all gave me a horrible time  no respect.  So I am stuck with 2 damaged TVs now  still fighting for a refund.  My advice to all - Get a SONY from a local store for perfection  no worries
Hello,I purchased the AVIC-D2, XM and the iPod kit from Amazon.  I then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup.  After 3.5 hours they failed.  I decided that I'd return the items because I needed to get an alternative gift before Christmas and I didn't have time to find another way to get it installed.  I was able to return the D2, but the GEX-P10XMT and the IB100II  are not returnable.  It turns out that Amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies.  Had I realized that Amazon would sell me something that I can't return I would have purchased elsewhere.  At this point I will never purchase anything else from Amazon ever again
Horrible. The gears ingage before the tape is even loaded. You have to force the tape into the moving gears and hold down the tape door as it does not latch to stay closed on it's own. When the tapes are rewinding it is very loud and slams the tape when it is done. You can just hear the damage being done. This model destroyed several of my daughters tapes. We really needed a rewinder to preserve our vcr and chose this model because it has an option to clean the tapes, preserving them also - this would be great providing it functioned properly. Thinking maybe I got a defunct one I had Amazon send out another, it too functioned in the exact same manner. Nope mine wasn't bad, their all bad, this model is disfunctional. I've advised Amazon not to carry units that they have become aware do not work properly. I wish Amazon direct had good models to choose from, this one is not
I am very happy with my Meridian Color and the other mapsend products I have purchased, however, at first I couldnt get this product to work.I had no problem getting this software to run with XP (even without the patch), however I couldnt view the basemap I had loaded onto my Magellan.  I tried to address this with the company.  It has been three days now and they have not even returned my emails.  Customer service for this product is nonexistant.I joined the Yahoo message board and got a simple answer to my question in about four hours someone posted the answer.  Turns out I just had to go to the Menu -- Card Utilities and maunually select the basemap.  I did not know that basemaps dont change automaticaly like the detailed maps do.I cannt say enough great things about my experience with my magellan meridian color though.  Navigating through Hungary like a pro, I didnt miss a single turn.  I would never recommend any of their products to someone who isnt willing or doesnt have the aptitude to learn about it.  The Magellan Meridian series is in my opinion the finest product on the market for what it does, portability it provides and is 100 percent upgradable with new software and new maps.Get you head out of your a__ Thales.  You have some great products, but you are blowing your customer support base with non existant customer support.  I recommend anyone with a question about softward or the GPS join the yahoo groups and post the question there.  Dont waste your time with customer support.
This unit is not compatible with the Sprint PPC 6700 as posted above! Make sure you call Pioneer with your telephone model number for compatibility. I tried the PPC 6700 and my wife's phone (another sprint phone, not sure on the model number). Both have issue and Pioneer's customer service agent was horrible and would not help solve this issue, only to blame me for not calling Pioneer first! This unit is the first device that was not compatible with my phone that I ran into
The clear plastic windows of the sleeves emit a strong chemical smell.  I bought two boxes; both boxes stank.  Maybe if you pay a little more you get the non-stinky kind.You get red, orange, yellow, green and blue sleeves, 10 of each
I was hopeful about using this mouse for gaming, and its response time did deliver. It is more precise in it's cursor control than any other mouse I've used.However, it was apparently designed for someone with smaller hands than me. I find it's side buttons are difficult to use. They're very small and their action is not to my liking.Further, I was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using Mac OS X Tiger. The Steer Mouse driver provided the best support and it supports everything except the right side buttons. I've found nothing that supports those buttons on the Mac platform to date
I'm a gamer.  I play for hours a day and currently use a simple MS intellimouse optical.  Well I was looking for something a little more pro, and in my searching I saw the Razer line of gaming mice.  I uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out, only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with.  It's got large rubber triming down each side, so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons.  I only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will NEVER, EVER, be able to reach them during game play.  It also feels too long and flat, so the scroll wheel is note easily reached, and your hand does not rest comfortably. Yeah, it looks great, and I'm sure it's doing an amazing job a moving precisely.  However, I can't get it to move correctly in my hand due to its horrible shape, so for gaming, it's rather worthless. 
Comes preconfigured with a private ip address. Upon changing the units' address to match my home network it locked up and became unuseable. I sent it back. Poor product. I might add that I make my living configuring networks. This is a poor product, period
I set up everthing according to the Quick install. All setting is correct but i still could not print. I call Technical support,on hold for 20 minuts then told me he was not the right support agent. Back in the loop i go . wait for 30 more minutes 2nd agent told me the same thing. Don't waste your time calling thier support. if it work out of the box great if not return it don't waste ur life like i did
I bought these head phones because I read all the reviews that gave it 4's and 5's, so I expected a lot out of them. The truth is you really shouldn't...they don't sound particularly awesome and I was rather disappointed that I actually spent close to $30.00 after shipping and stuff. The mid-highs and highs sound fine, but I had issues with bass and mid-low response, especially when I plugged it into my computer. Plus they are not super comfortable either; the hinges nip at your neck when you don't have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses.All in all, I wished i had spent my money on something else. But they do look pretty cool.
I got this and the RangeBooster is a lie. It has NOT boosted any kind of range on my network. It also goes in and out of service often. I wasted my money on this one
I installed this in my new Garmin Nuvi GPS prior to making a trip to Iowa City, Iowa.  Thought that it would provide some information useful about the City and the surrounding area.  Found that there is not a single location in the memory that covers anywhere in Iowa.  This is advertised as a North American travel guide.  Did they move Iowa
The printer works great as a usb printer, a fax machine, and copier.It may as well not even have a network port on it.The networking driver will find the printer ,but then it goes back to searching for a printer, and this loop continues till you give up.I can't tell if thr network scanning works because of the above driver problem.I can tell you that a Dell 1600 works great as a network printer, network scanner, fax  copier. We have 3 of these and we tried this Hp 3055 and I would not reccommend it to anyon
Amazon recommends the $59 Apple Protection plan for the Ipod Shuffle --2nd Generation  ----  Be advised the Apple store offers a $39 2yr plan for just the Ipod Nano 2nd Gen and Ipod Shuffle 2nd Gen.  Both plans work great, If you have one of these two new machines save yourself $20
I bought 2 of these drives to set up a RAID1 array (mirror) and one of them continuously has errors, causing the array to be degraded. I called tech support and they said these drives do not support RAID. Big let down, I have to go for the server version which will end up costing much more
i bought this humidifier reading the reviews here. but when i actually used for a few days, i found that it provided no relief from dryness while sleeping or during the day. it pretty much did nothing except make the room hotter. i would not recommend this to anyone
I have been a fan of Western Digital hard drives for many years, but that ended with this product.  I purchased an Essential Edition 250GB drive for my daughter as a Christmas gift, by New Years it was DOA.  Giving WD the benefit of the doubt, I exchanged it for an identical replacement.  This one made it until early March.  Three clicks and it turns off.  WD says there is nothing I can do but return it under a RMA.  They can do nothing about the lost data.  So much for using this drive for backing up important files.  I've have had at least a dozen WD drives over the years and never had a failure, they just became obsolete because of their size.  This produce however....STAY AWAY
Don't believe the claim that you can "just plug it in and it's ready to use." This product is set up for Windows, and the instructions for installing the drive for a Mac fail to mention that you have to reformat the drive to remove the Windows software. It's easy to become hopelessly fouled up.Don't expect any help from Western Digital. If you can actually get connected to them, and your call isn't dropped while you wait for 40 minutes or so, you'll get a customer rep who reads to you from the same useless manual that came from the drive. Their web site help is equally useless
This kit is neat; I have to admit that.  It comes with all the materials needed to make a nice little coffee table book.  However, the kit itself is a little pricey considering that A) there's only 10 pages, B) the pages are only 5 x 7, and C) the pages are not double-sided.  The software included, although as simple and easy-to-use as can be, is so limiting, it doesn't actually feel like you have made this book yourself.  Instead, it's as though you're in preschool, bringing in the pictures and having Teacher put it together for you.  You can arrange different page setups for different themes as you please, but there is seldom the precise one that you really want.  It doesn't help that half of the themes have these cutesy "scrap book" elements that look absolutely ridiculous.However, the book itself is pretty slick once you make many, many comprimises.  The only reason I gave this two stars is for the materials included
Purchased for my daughter, an English teacher, Scrabble lover. She said she'd rather have a book to look up words and most of the features on the Franklin she'd never use and thought they took away from the mental challenge of the game. She said it would end up on a shelf in her house. She'd rather have a paperback Scrabble Dictionary. I returned the Franklin. She didn't even like the idea of taking it to school for her kids to use when she lets them play Scrabble in class
I purchased the Rino 130 specifically because it also had the  radio and NOAA features.  Fortunately I read the other reviews on this model as well as the 120 and 110 versions that complained about poor radio performance. I tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible, and I was able to return the unit to Amazon in time for a full refund.  Be sure to test this yourself.  Also the buttons are very small, and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down.  I returned the Rino 130 and purchased a Garmin Etrex Legend C (color display) for about the same price.  I will miss the NOAA feature of the 130 but not the radio.  This is an overpriced GPS.  Spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed
Don't buy it.  In the 6 months I had the phone, the screen burnt out so I can see the numbers, the answering machine is horrible, and I get better reception from my baby monitor.  I had a cheap Panasonic beforehand which was much better.  This was a complete waste of $$.  Hooking it up to your PC to get those "cool" features is just a pain.  I'm having a tough time returning this.  Be careful
While I have been very pleased with the performance of this product, configuration and setup was very easy, and even updates to the device are easy to do, it's not reliable.It seems that every 3 or 4 days I lose connection to the Internet. This is a 7 PC network, couple of servers.  There really isn't huge bandwidth being used.  But it is like it gets frozen - you can't ping it, you can't get to anything on the outside like the gateway or DNS servers, and a simple power reset gets it working again.Nothing is in the log, I have to believe this is some sort of firmware problem.  I have checked all the ideas on Netgear's site without help. I know at least some of the time it freezes during the middle of the night, when no one is using it.  Could it be getting zapped from the outside somehow? But it sure is not reliable, I can't recommend it
This router has to be one of the worst made products on the market, and has the poor customer service.  This router was defective out of the box, took 3 weeks of communication with Linksys's customer service before I finally just returned it and build my own router with the same functions
I recently bought this thinking I could use it to upgrade my TI-86 calculator. To my surprise I heard it was incompatible with XP. I supposed the worst that could happen is that it wouldn't work. As soon as I recieved the Cable it said to go to the website...  so I went and updated the software specific to my calculator. After the installation it asked me to restart. After the restart I immediatly recieved a Blue Screen of death and luckily windows XP found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that I would have to do a format. I have not fully installed it yet as now I have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not 100% XP compatible and may mess up your system
This item, produced and marketed exclusively for the iAudio X5, is entirely useless. The carrying case does not comply with the measurements of the device itself. The ONLY way to insert the device into the limited size and shape of this carrying case would be to cut the case wide open with scissors. Even if one could somehow manage to squeeze an iAudio into the tiny case, the designers forgot to install an opening for the charger. I returned mine immediately. If you order this item you will be frustrated with a poorly designed, ill-fitting, unacceptable piece of worthless junk
I just wasted $16.35 on this piece of junk.  It arrived quickly, and became unusable even faster.For those of you used to disposable screen covers, there is only one in this package!  The instructions say you can clean it, but it came out of the packaging with lint on it, which immediately adhered to the sticky side, and could not be cleaned off.  Since the package was opened, it could not be returned. 
This is a good product. Not as good as an MP3 player with internal memory, as it is bulkier. But, it is great for the price. The only drawback is, it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory. Running with it can be uncomfortable at times...if you are a runner, you may prefer a smaller mp3 player, one you can put in your shorts pocket...
 This is my third Asus mother board. All were great, manual was excellent and email support was swift. Now all of these reasons to buy asus are missing. Manual provides no assistance, zero. FAQ online, nothing. email for assistance, no reply. Asus user Forum, no help. Got all accomplished without assistance. Went to register .... and couldn't get that done, so I gave up on it. I've wasted 38 hours on account of missing basic information  support. My previous motherboards (ASUS) were well documented with excellent definitions of BIOS options, etc. Everything went smoothly. I expected the same excellent support from ASUS today, I didn't get it. No more Asus. Be ware
With no mode settings(repeat, shuffle, etc) or shock protection, this cd player is pretty undesirable, but if you're just looking for something to hold you over then this'll do. It has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright. It could be with just mine, but every pair of headphones, new and old, that I use with it, the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers, they work fine. Like I said, if you just want a temporary thing then I guess this is good for you
I thought this item came with or you had a choice of color. It did not. It is silver with black trim. It is also not very portible, you have to play it while its sitting on a flat, level surface.
First off the Software is Horrible!! I have XP Media Center and the Win2000 interface program won't even run. The hardware drivers interfere with other programs on my computer; Now my Cineplayer has no sound and when i double click on my speaker icon in my tray, an error message comes up saying I have no active mixer devices available. I spent hours trying to resolve and my computer is still messed up. The remote is useless, I will have to get a Microsoft remote, and the picture quality using Media Center is POOR at best. Save your money and AVOID this item. IF YOU HAVE TO TRY IT, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND INSTALLING NORTON GOBACK OR SIMILAR SOFTWARE TO UNDO THE PROBLEMS YOU WILL HAVE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!
I find these ear buds to be absolutely uncomfortable. I would rate the product a zero if it were an option. I can't even use them because they're too uncomfortable to wear. Not worth the money, even though they're cheap
These are $10 headphones. There's nothing amazing about them in my opinion.  I bought them to use with my ipod when I'm out, or at work.  Right out of the box, I was disappointed with the fit, and I know everyone is going to be different, but for me they just aren't comfortable.  The sound quality is clear, but very thin and lacking bass. Even when I'm pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit, the bass just isn't good. EQ settings to boost the bass don't help either, and often reduce sound quality even more. The ear clips don't really seem to do that much either.  They kind of keep them on your ears but don't really hold them IN your ears at all.  The ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well.In summary, I wouldn't recommend these for music, but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word, they might be good-IF you can tolerate them in your ears for that long
Just a heads-up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides. You will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them. Given the verbiage on the box, it caught me as enough of a surprise that I returned the scanner. I'm not OK with deception like that
These blank discs are defective. I was never able to record any pictures or audio data to them.The Maxell blank discs that I have did the job fine.
I ordered this item thinking that it would be useful when on the road in hotel rooms to light up my work area.  WRONG !!  The light is so DIM, the only thing it might be good for is a night light! This lamp is a good idea, but much too weak to be of any help
I was looking for a small cheap Mp3 player and I didn't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me. I saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so I decided to buy it. When I got the Creative nano I was really happy with its preformance until I tried to put my subscription music onto it. Thats when I learned that it wouldn't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money.After that I started realising all of its imperfections. You can't use the FM radio in the car without hearing mostly static. You can't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to. Don't get me wrong, there are some good sides to this Mp3 player but I still would definately not recommend it
I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT I RECEIVED FROM TIGER.IT WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED AND TO RETURN IT WOULD COST ME MORE THAN I PAID FOR IT.THE COMPANY CHARGES TOOOOO MANY FEES.I AM VERY UNHAPPY  NOW I HAVE A PRODUCT THAT I CAN'T USE OR RETURN
I've always held the philosophy you are what you're entertained by. So, those who like Ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women. And speaking of women...Ludacris never met one who wasn't a h-o.Ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men: you demean and look down on women for being h-oes, yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you'll have no problems getting laid. But then, you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you, so you go and find a "nice girl" because you can respect her and marry her and procreate with her. But then you cheat on her with a "bad girl" because h-oes need h-oes; but then you can't respect the "bad girl" because she's a slut, so you go back to the "good girl." But she's not nasty enough for you, so then...around and around we go. Women are basically being punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what the heck they want from us.He's OBSESSED with sex and h-oes. It makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. Maybe Ludapis saw his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever. I guess if she had actually RAISED him and shown him how to respect women-- ALL women--then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is. What's the music like? Well I'll give him 2 stars for mentioning TLC in What's Your Fantasy. That's it.Addendum: 7/27-07 Some may wonder why I'm "wasting' my time giving Ludacris negative reviews. Well, first of all, if only people who liked the product were the only ones to review it, everything on Amazon would have 5 stars, which would be an inaccurate sign of its quality. Secondly, I don't like Ludacris. I would give Ludacris more respect if I felt he gave my gender more respect; but he doesn't. My diatribe above shows what my problem with him is, and I feel that argument is valid. There's no way to critique Ludacris' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women. Why should I like him when he seems to have nothing but contempt for us? I'm biased against him because he's biased against me. So he gets a bad rating out of s-p-i-t-e
someone get this band a producer and put them in a decent studio, please.  the recording and mixing on this disc is flat-out atrocious.   download a few tracks and hear for yourself.'feburary' and '99 with an anchor' show promise.otherwise it's taking back sunday meets hawthorn heights meets fallout boy meets .... you get the picture
Tihs Album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day. I like all his other albums better I don't Know why he decided to release this crap.But the only song I really Like is hip hip qurtables
this industry is "goin down"  u call this an album???  LO
I'm sorry but the guy below me doesn't know music if he was slapped with a Gang starr cd. This mess is ridiculous. I wouldn't even want to hear this garbage in the klub let alone banging in my car. They are the modern day version of Young mc....here today gone tomorrow
This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed.
Ok, so the song playing when Brian goes and we see mia for the first time is a song called "Deep Enough (Urban remix)" by Live.  I have the other songs written down, including the one played between the two buildings, so I will find them and tell you.  If you all want only the songs that were actually in the movie, rent the dvd, and take about ten minutes to watch the credits and write down the song names and artists.  That's how I have only the songs that are in the movie
There are 2 really good songs on here.  The first is "Untitled," which sounds like Gibbard was listening to a lot of Brian Wilson at the time he wrote it.  The percussion sounds like it could have been on pet sounds.  "Underwater" is a pretty good song...but the real jewel on the album is "Send Packing."  It really is a beautiful, well-written song.  The rest of the album sounds kind of thrown together and most of the songs would have been much better if they had been recorded with real instruments.  Basically, the novelty of the kid instrument thing wears off really quickly.  All in all, I wouldn't spend 10 bucks on it, but a couple tracks are pretty good
This is not the music from the movie. This purchase was a Major dissapointment. You would do beter searching for the music credits for titles, then download the tracks form your music subscriber
it is beyond me that a record label would put this out. it's so embarassing how bad he rips bright eyes from song structure, subject  the production and even the cover art looks just like fevers and mirrors.
Get's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd. What a mess! Never should have been made. Even Julie is way past the point of playing this onstage. She half talks her way through her songs, her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film. Sorry Julie, should have left it alone.The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal.The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it.Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file.As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked? C'mon Julie, there was a reason for that, the show SUCKED!
Cheap Trick's second album is very disappointing to me afterthe good, but raw, "Live In The Studio", 1977-76 recordedCheap Trick. Almost all of the material here is so watered down that it REALLY COMES OFF WAY BETTER on the later many Live disks they did.After a good start w/ "Hello There", a concert favorite for many years, is the only thing here to write home about when one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the Budokan and other Live recordings later.Tom Werman and Rick Niesen were on a show in 1991 that I hadrecorded on a tape once and Werman, noce a friend of Tom Petersson's said, quote: "My three albums with Cheap Trickgot better and better...", to which the ever sarcastic RickNielsen said, "Selling, maybe." Not realizing that brotherRick was slamming him, Werman then continued, "Exactly"...Oh boy. We now see why producing Cheap Trick albums throughthe years has become like playing Russian Roulette. It's nothard to get better than this and five months later the solid,but somewhat oeverrated 'Heaven Tonight' came out...(And theguys EVEN bought Werman back for Dream Police. Things turned out better when Pete Comita, then later Jon Brant joined theband. Yep - the best was yet to come - in the '80'
After months of searching, I found the out of print cd here.  I had never heard it, but after hearing the fabulous song My Only from the Good as it gets  movie soundtrack, I had to hear the album.  What a disappointment!  Oh well, it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song
Listening to the Standards being sung by Rod Stewart is like listening to Classical Music being played on a kazoo! If you're new to this music, try out some Sinatra CD's. He's the guy who sets the standard when it comes to singing the Standards
Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities.  The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album.  Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song.  The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason.  It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear.  The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'.  Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording.  Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL
"Maiden Voyage" appears on innumerable lists of jazz masterpieces, and it is clear from the first listen that both the composition and the playing are at a level of technical proficiency unmatched on most albums of this era or any time afterward. Nevertheless, the finished product is not one that all listeners will find appealing. To these ears, this album seems aimless and even somewhat annoying. The songs meander without clear structure and Tony Williams' drumming seems at times to be going in a direction opposite that of the rest of the band. The influence of this album is indisputable, but its enjoyability is a more subjective matter. If you enjoy groundbreaking, cerebral jazz such as the music made by Miles Davis' second quintet, then this album will probably work for you. If, on the other hand, you favor Hancock's earlier and more accessible albums "Takin' Off" and "My Point of View," this album may be a bit of a letdown
How can he be such an enormous talent when all he does is copy off of other people? sorry i just cant see it. I dont think he does justice to Nolan Porter's "If I could only be sure" on the first track at all: If you want to hear some great music listen to the original!!!
Might just be me--but this is one of those CD's that the song they play on the radio is the only decent one. Maybe I'm too old for the rest--but wish I had kept the crystal so I could sell it on Ebay
I'm an avid tony yayo fan, but this album just didn't cut it. maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure. i don't know. but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them. Hopefully his next album will be way better. a few songs are good to listen to. I would think, coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about, but "so seductive" being your first single?? come on. i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean. rating C
I can't believe rubbish like this goes platinum. Rap today with a few exceptions is a joke. People like Chingy, Nelly, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Lil Jon and any other idiot with Lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke. What is really getting me angry is how so many people don't give any respect to real rap legends like Tupac and Biggie, and give tons of respect to all these clowns. People are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. All these people talk about is money, bling bling and sex. Rap used to be about the streets now its just all i've got so much money and stuff. If you want a real rap CD then get one of the following.NWA - Straight Outta ComptonIce Cube - Amerikka's Most WantedDr Dre - The ChronicSnoop Doggy Dogg - DoggystyleNas - IllmaticTha Dogg Pound - Dogg FoodTupac - Me Against The WorldTupac - All Eyez On meTupac - Greatest Hits50 Cent - Power Of The DollarBiggie - Life After DeathYou get the picture
I love love tegan and sara and when I found out this was one of their favorite cds I have to admit....I think i was devastated. I just saw pretty girls make graves last night and they really could not have sounded worse.Not just not enjoyable...unbelieveably horrible. I think you should take your money and spend it on a cd that actually sounds like good music. Don't make your ears go through this much pain
Before you get all worked up, let me say that he has a voice, but he really doesn't have a style.  he sings songs way too straight, he makes even Bobby Short sound like an improviser!  He also doesn't seem to be in touch with his masculine side, his vocie is very, well if ying is male, and yang is female, he sounds very yang.  He needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he won't sound so obnoxious, then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying(masculine side) in his voice.  He needs to hear a few Billy Eckstine lp's.  I don't think he can change but here's hoping he'll take my advice.  As far as you buying this cd it is your decision, this is just my honest opinion
Many albums, including this one, have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same; but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting - except for the first two tracks.  The use of many poetry elements in their lyrics can't save the blandness of the music.  "What About Everything" and "Life Less Ordinary" are good songs.  The rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep. 
Sounds like the background music used in the 70's Rockford Files TV crime show...and a little like the CHIPS music too. Similar to music by Tom Scott from back then. The crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky, they are more smooth groovin funk. The sound for the times is very clean, too produced for true funkyness. Don't get me wrong I like the old 60's JAZZ crusaders, just not this 70's phase of their career...they sold out to a large extent, and continue to do so, it's where the money is.  No improvisatory feel either. This is for smooth jazz lovers. hard funk lovers will be disappointed, as will true jazzers.  I wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60's but they keep burying it like it never happened, even to this day, afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid/late 60's true jazz albums. Their 70's albums like this are partly to blame for today's smooth jazz... in other words, not really jazz, not really funky, just kind of smooth groovin, more for casual adults and offices. not challenging, not offensive, formulated to an extent. But hey if you like this, that's cool, just dont think it's real jazz, or real funk. It's smooth and casual, slightly simmers, pleasant background music, but doesn't COOK like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz, funk, and fusion. It just sounds like they are holding back...I know they can play more advanced, and write more creatively, they just choose not to ever since the 60's
Wow, did someone slip the wrong CD into my jewelbox or what?If you're a fan of Allison's other work, epect nothing like what you've heard before.  This is mostly a pop album, and the songs that could have been saved are ruined by the awful engineering.  The sound is way over compressed and artificial sounding.  Even Allisons voice has no drive to it.Steve Earl is no match on the guitar for Joe McMahan who played on the Show CD/DVD.
I really really really really like Allison Moorer.  Have been a fan since her first record, have road-tripped to see her numerous times, and love her songwriting and singing.That said -- "Getting Somewhere" is by far the least satisfying of her records.  No memorable songs.  Over-produced.  No "guts", as another reviewer said.When the Allison Moorer/Doyle "Butch" Primm songwriting team called it quits (in more ways than one), their Lennon/McCartney-caliber teamwork was lost.  Not that Moorer sounds like The Beatles, but Allison and Butch complemented each other well when composing music.  This CD is not only unmemorable but I doubt I would care to ever listen to it again.  Such a shame.  I've never had anything negative to say about Allison in the 8 years I've been a fan.  But this CD left me cold.It hurts a bit to say this, but I cannot recommend this CD.The closest analogy I can think of that relates to how different this CD is from her earlier work is the B-story line from an episode of "The Larry Sanders Show".  In that episode, Sanders' head writer Phil (played by Wallace Langham) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy.  As a result he lost his edge.  When he was a miserable person he was an edgy, cynical, funny jokewriter.  When he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job.      Same with Moorer.  Since her recent changes in her social life she has started "singing a sweeter tune" in her life, but it came with a cost.  She doesn't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that "other" songwriter who was so good -- a little edgy, sad, sometimes bitter, or at least that's how I interpreted it.  Granted, that wasn't her entire oeuvre, but it is what made her songs special for me.  Now she's happy and she might as well be writing songs for Barney the Dinosaur
Now on their sixth studio album (and second on a major label) Carbon Leaf plays it safe with the inoffensive rock/pop of "Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat." Lead vocalist Barry Privett has a warm, pleasant way of delivering his lyrics, and renowned producer Peter Collins fulfills his duties. Nevertheless, the 11-song collection is most notable for its power of subtlety. In fact, it is so subtle that not one song is memorable.Some lyrics are heartfelt ("The War Was In Color" recounts a conversation between a grandfather and grandson, lead single "Learn to Fly" regretfully summons up inner strength) but with such flat, by-the-numbers melodies these songs have little to stand on. Everything sounds just fine, but nothing is endearing. Every guitar strum and drum beat can be predicted ten seconds prior to its appearance, and Privett, despite his appealing voice, could easily be singing one extremely long song. This project is obviously well-intentioned, but many other bands have done this before and better. These guys without a doubt have talent, but this album will soon be forgotten for good reason. Next time they will hopefully carve out a more unique sound than the one on this record.
I was disappointed with the album as a whole.  When I heard the song "Drink to Me Babe, Then", I thought it was great and sounded like The Shins.  The rest of the album was boring lyrically
Layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time. Cream is one of the most boring bands in history. Why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like Dire Straits, and Metallicawho rock.PS.This Clapton compilation has no good songs so please don'tbuy it at all
Having watched most, if not all of John Waters films i was sorely dissapointed by this Album, obviously his name was put to something he hadn't quite looked deeply enough in to. Talk about misleading. As we all know John Waters has a certain reputation for sleaze, trash, camp, kitch and bad taste in all the best possible terms, this album had none of this. Shame on you John Waters for putting your name to a complete load of rubbis
I think India is one of the most talented artists today. Her voice is sensational. Sadly, as with many great artists today, this album feels more producer/market-driven rather than artist-driven. I understand that Regaetton is popular right now. I would even understand including a few Reggaeton-flavored songs to "keep up with the times" (Shakira's "La Tortura" comes to mind). But who mixes two genres within a single song?!? "Soy Differente" flows perfectly as a salsa, until Regaetton beats come in. The style feels very out-of-place in this song, as in most other songs in this album. Maybe this kind of thing will work at a club, but not for extended listening. In my opinion, the producers are making this album more marketable while stiffling India's own style. I hope she will regain contol by the next album
Oh, this is pure adult garbage all right.I have never heard a more disguisting piece of music then this, then again the movie was garbage also
I purchased a copy of this album after a suggestion from a friend.....a few hours later in ended up in the bin.....very dissapointing, bland and not to mention boring and derivative (some people from New York would understand what I mean).  In summary....not only does kylie mingogue (I wont grace her name with capitals) fall flat on cd....she also cannot perform live and rely's on "gay camp it up" imagery to hide behind (a very cheap and politically incorrect exploit).  A very bad performer and a shameful album. 
Mcmurtrys new album really disappoints.  I am a longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album slipping out of character with James past work (as well as somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical).  While Mcmurtry has had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza (See the Elephant) or that provide an echo to the way we Americans spend our time (Holiday), his attempts on Childish things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing.  In past attempts Mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the positive and the negative of Americana, yet all the remains in the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard downside. The thoughtfulness evaporated on this work. Like many aging musicians, Mcmurtry could not resist the tempation to jump into personal politics to replace the vacuum of meaningful verse.  The cliche and empty "We Cant Make It Here" is a meaningless mix of 70s era socialism and the ills of modern era entitlement policies that displays an ignorance of both democracy and personal responsibility.  Mcmurtry, previously able to frame an issue, seems oblivious that those of different political persuasions could easily fit the same song title to a wholly opposed set of social ills.   Criticism is not intelligence, and we can only hope that Mcmurtry can get on track going forward.  Perhaps he should shun the  "PC Crowd" and seek his own space and more thoughtful views of the complex but substantial American Scene for his next album
Is there anything more sanctimonious than filming your last concert and inviting a bunch of fellow overrated hacks (Clapton, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell) to the occasion, as if it's some monumental event? Please! As if the Band were anything worthwhile in the first place. Sorry, but the whole concept of a bunch of Canadians (well, four of five anyway) writing this stuff about Americana always came across to me as pretentious -- and it doesn't get much worse than that stupid shot of Levon Helm wheezing through "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down."These guys were just the beneficiaries of Rolling Stone/elitist rock critic propaganda. (And to think they made fun of prog bands for writing inane lyrics -- huh!) I think Martin Newell put it best when he called the Band "dreadful bearded ghastliness."
Michael Jackson is one of the most gifted songwriters/singers of our time. You can discuss his person, you can discuss his behaviour, and all the other stuff, but you can't really take that away from him. And that's exactly why this album is so unacceptable, coming from someone like him - when you've reached superstardom and gone beyond it, you don't release a record that's so horribly mixed up and full of second grade tracks that it's bound to be a faliure. At least, you should expect to hear for it. And hear for it he did, cause the critics didn't go lightly on this one. And it's not that bad, actually. I mean, that's what I have my program function in my CD-player for, and my CD-burner.The album starts on a fair streak - Unbreakable, Heartbreaker and Invincible - are all fair tracks - below average for MJ, sounds like a watered down selection of discarded tracks from Dangerous that were then discarded for HIStory and then discarded for Blood On The Dance Floor, and full of badly placed guest rappers to top it off - but apart from that, if you forget who made this music, these are actually good, funky dance tracks. For Michael Jackson they're passable, but nothing more. *SKIP*On to track 8 - Speechless - arguably the strongest moment on the record. One of only two tracks that Jackson actually penned himself, and it shows. The amount of emotion in his voice will knock you prone, and actually proves very well what the rest of the album lacks: Joy for the music, and personal emotion. The lyrics are like a poem, and one of the most beautiful love declarations in all their simplicity. Top grade to Jackson for this one track, and if you are into his music, buy the CD cheeply just to get this track.Track 9 - 2000 Watts - is another of the stronger moments of the record. This one is simply plain fun, and that's another important lesson Jackson should have lurned - to let go of the reigns, and stop caring whether it's hip or street or down with the trend - because it isn't - but this is darn good pop music, and nigh irresistable. *SKIP*On to track 13 - Cry - penned by R. Kelley. The same R. Kelley who is guilty of writing one of the most horrible songs of all times (I Believe I Can Fly, if you had doubts), but it seems that with Jackson, he can do no wrong. He wrote the endearing You Are Not Alone - major hit in Europe - and this track is possibly even better. Oh, forget about the sappy lyrics, and just enjoy the wonderfull music. This is pop writing in top class, and if Jackson sounds like he takes the Marthyr role a bit too seriously, it's still one of the best tracks on the record.Track 14 - The Lost Children - is the other song penned by Michael alone, and it's not a bad effort - had it not been for the children choir and sleezy intro, you could probably have ignored the lyrics and enjoyed a nice pop tune. As it is, it falls somewhat flat, and becomes completely choking in the end - but yes, it's a nice tune. Thumps up, mr. Jackson.Track 15 - Whatever Happens. Ok, that's one weird track. Michael Jackson featuring Santane. Wtf? Well, kudos for doing this, and it actually works, in a sort of absurd way. Not single potential, and not a classic, but it's not embarassing, and as an album filler, it's completely acceptable as a cureosity.Well, what about the rest of it then? Lead single You Rock My World was never my favorite - the spoken intro is downright embarassing - but the track is not bad. I can accept that on the record. The same is not true for the horrible ballads Break Of Dawn, Heaven Can Wait, Butterflies, You Are My Life and Don't Walk Away. One is worse than the next, and every time I just try to listen to them, I start chocking to the degree of loosing my last meal. Yes, it's that bad, no really, it's horrible. I. Can't. Stand. These. Songs. Period. There are simply no redeeming qualities for me.And then the two monstrosities - Privacy and Threatened - that just sound like a very - very - bad joke on the man himself. Tabloid Junkie from HIStory actually worked, because it packed a great punch, and well, had not been heart before. Well it had been, it was pretty much the same as Why You Wanna Trip On Me from Dangerous, but still. It worked. Ghosts was a good track of Blood On The Dance Floor. Forget about the movie that was - well, embarassing. But the music was good. These tracks aren't. They sound dated, repetitive, out of place and utterly boring and uninspired. Get over it Jackson, we don't want to hear more about the media nagging you, it's not going to make them go away.Well, all in all, what do we have ... To take the album from A to Z:Unbreakable - 6/10 - A fair dance track.Heartbreaker - 6/10 - same.Invincible - 6/10 - same.Break Of Dawn - 0/10 - Horrible R'n'B overproduced. Vomit.Heaven Can Wait - 0/10 - same.You Rock My World - 5/10 - well, at least it sounds new.Butterflies - 0/10 - more vomit.Speechless - 10/10 - the flower in the dirt. One true MJ song.2000 Watts - 8/10 - Very enjoyable, and stands out tall compared to the rest.You Are My Life - 0/10 - even more vomit.Privacy - 2/10 - Yawn. Repetitive and dated.Don't Walk Away - 0/10 - end of vomit.Cry - 9/10 - beautiful showmanship, Kelly + Jackson works - again.The Lost Children - 6/10 - well, it has potential.Whatever Happens - 7/10 - interesting, and well, refreshing, if somewhat strange.Threatened - 2/10 - same as Privacy, and exactly as boring.This yields and average about 3.6/10, or 2/5 stars, which actually matches my fealings for this album fairly well. Yes, I'm harsh, but from a man as gifted as Jackson, you just expect more. Quality control next time, please, mr. Jackson.On the bottom line: Outtakes The Way You Love Me and We've Had Enough showed up on the 2004 Ultimate collection and outranked 2/3 of this album by far. Go figure
I felt like I was taking a piss on myself the whole time I listened to this album. What happened to the 40 water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1, 2pac, and mc breed? This clone of 40 raps with the likes of Lil jon (wack as hell), washed up 80 year old too short, and a bunch of losers I have never heard of. The album only gets props because eightball and mjg are on the album and ugk. And they almost played themselves by appearing on this god awful so called "album". E-40 has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk called "hyphy" in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless career. The album has some decent beats on it but there is no kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere. E-40 wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Krs-One cd. This cd is wack simple and plain, Pee-40 is a beat waster, and he needs to find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars!!
If any kid music annoys you, this CD is NOT for you.  These are good old classic songs, but almost ruined with strange styles and irrelevant talking to intro the songs.  I'm throwing it away.  I want my two-year-old to know the songs I know and love, but this was a bad buy on my part. 
 I loved '' careless love`` and saw Madeleine live here in Rio de Janeiro in a reasonably good show.I am quite disappointed with this album however because I had great expectations.Let's face it folks, however smoky and billiesque her voice is she is never going to have the power and the range of the original.She needs to be really close miked and well recorded to get that voice to sound right.This is obvious from seeing her live. So what were those marketing executives thinking by promoting a cd full of soft and slow ballad covers that are obviously going to turn a huge spotlight  on her  vocal delivery? Those songs need an Ella,a Sarah Vaughn,or even a Shirley Horn -to name some  giants- to have a chance of pulling it off with their huge range, timing and phrasing. To compound the problem , the recording engineers/producers did not do a great job on her voice or the rest of the band for that matter.Everything is much too soft and distant (unlike careless love).If you want an atmospheric but still powerful sound you must produce something like the last Shirley Horn cds. Last but not least the rest of the good band are not allowed to play anything remotely interesting but are relegated to  very minimalist backing chores. I think there is a misconception with the record excecs that M.P. has the qualities to make her a modern  pop-jazz diva ala Diana Krall.She has to find her real voice and the correct material to match.Good luck. 
Having listened to Steven's previous albums, Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans countless times, I cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album.  Stevens blatantly rips off his own music.  I consider Michigan to be Sufjan's masterpiece.  Do yourself a favor and start there
I wanted to like BROTHERHOOD, for the simple reason that nearly every New Order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it, usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at least apathy). Turns out they were right: BROTHERHOOD is half an album. Most of its nine songs feel unfinished, as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash LOW-LIFE and didn't care about the end result. BROTHERHOOD is a rush job, plain and simple, but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort. "As It Is When It Was" overcomes the album's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic, and the melody is quite lovely. "All Day Long", the emotional centerpiece of the album by default, is an intelligent (if half-hearted) protest against child abuse. While "Angel Dust" lacks a decent hook, its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest. And the toss-off "Every Little Counts" has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in New Order's work.The most popular song on BROTHERHOOD is, of course, "Bizarre Love Triangle". So good it seems to belong to a different album entirely, "Bizarre Love Triangle" is truly New Order's masterpiece. The solid beat, slick sequencer work, and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best: catchy, danceable, and downright euphoric. (Imagine how well it would have fit on LOW-LIFE.)Sadly, the rest of BROTHERHOOD is unremarkable. The album's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes, which has become New Order's signature sound, but the songwriting doesn't measure up. Buy the album if you're a trainspotter, but casual New Order fans would be better off picking up LOW-LIFE or 1983's POWER, CORRUPTION AND LIES. This one is just a footnote.
Why is Dylan taking sole credit on an album featuring a fair percentage of other peoples song writing ? Shame on you Bob
Man, can she get anymore stupid and talentless. She needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits. All the songs on this album are totally unlistenable! She completely lacks power, vocal range and versatility. Jennifer Lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today. She gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career. Just because your a great actor/actress doesn't necessarily mean you can sing, too. Some actors/actresses were able to achieve it, but not Jennifer Lopez. She needs to quit the music business while she still can. Please stick to acting...OH, WAIT! I forgot, she can't do that either!
I first became a fan of the Gorillaz with their excellent 2nd CD, Demon Days. The interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so "out there" that when you first hear one of their CD's...it sounds like complete garbage. But once you listen again and again, you start to like it more and more. Eventually you end up really liking the CD. That was the case with Demon Days. After enjoying that CD fully, I thought I should check out the first Gorillaz CD, and  I didn't like it all that much. There just seems to be very little actual songs on the CD. Way too much of it sounds like complete filler. There were a couple throwaway songs on Demon Days, but most of the stuff on that CD was great. Here, we've got songs that are just...boring. Nothing happens. I was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs, but it never happens. You just listen to 2-D whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background. (Such as on songs like New Genious, Man Research, and Starshine.) Some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all, sometimes sounding just like static noise. Songs like this, such as Double Bass, are cool for a minute or two, but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes. It gets boring. Other songs, like 5/4, M1 A1, and Rock the House are catchy at first, but just don't have staying power. They get old. 5/4 got annoying quickly, M1 A1 and Punk lost their appeal quickly, and Rock the House is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it. And songs like Latin Simone are just annoying. The remixes of 19-2000 and Clint Eastwood that end the CD are also fairly forgettable, although 19-2000's kind of catchy on the first couple listens. There are some good songs here, though. Tomorrow Comes Today, Clint Eastwood, Gravity, 19-2000, and Left Hand Suzuki Method are cool songs. Slow Country's kind of cool, too. And Dracula's got an awesome, almost haunting sound to it, and it's really absorbing. Although it too, unfortuantely, loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it. This small collection of good songs, though, is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks. Much of this CD just isn't really that good.I don't know...this CD just seemed empty. Very few meaningful tracks, lots of filler, and some really annoying and repetitive songs. Some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long, mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs. Clocking in at 72 minutes, (which makes it 22 minutes(!)longer than Demon Days) this CD was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff. People interested in The Gorillaz should pick up their superior follow-up, Demon Days, instead of this one. If I listened to this debut CD first, I probably wouldn't have ended up liking this band very much. The good news about this is that the Gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump; their CDs are getting better, not worse. That is a great sign for the future of this awesome band.
Ok, booty rap was good in the 90's, when it was offensive and raunchy like, 2 live crew, Disco Rick and The Dogs, Poison clan etc.....But this is just wack weak lyrics, corny typical krunk beats that start all sounding the same....And is it just me are these guys as rappers, just horrible there voices all raspy, and annoying and one the guy's from the groups always does that annoying shout thing in interviews like hahhhhherrrrrr.....( what is he on crack or something)So if you like radio friendly, pretty boy music then the Ying Yang twins are for you peace...
I LUV FALL OUT BOY!!!!!!!!!AWL SONGS GET 10 OUTTA 10!!!!!!DESERVS ALL 6 STARSS!!!
I don't understand the previous reviews - I found this recording positively dreadful, with Ruthie Henshall being the only one worth listening to. John Sinclair is abominable as George - he sounds like he's doing a (bad) imitation of Michael Crawford in Hello, Dolly. He does strange things to his words - I guess he's trying not to sound British, but why is he singing Summ-ar weath-ar instead of summer weather?    The Ilona is a bass - almost literally. I Resolve has been lowered for her, and yet she still cannot master the range of the song. To accomodate her, the second part of I Don't Know His Name has a truly odd key change. Were she remotely talented I could understand key changes to facilitate her singing, but she's not worth it.    The orchestrations are odd, too, with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. The rest of the singers range from fair (Kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression) to bad (Mr. Maraczek drags down EVERY SINGLE NOTE of Days Gone By. Luckily this is his only song.)    The Broadway revival, to my ear, still has the best voices, except, of course, that Barbara Cook (the original) outshines Diane Fratantoni, who is merely good (but who was a vast improvement over the Roundabout's original Amalia, the annoying Judy Kuhn.)     Get the original or revival recordings instead - this London version I would recommend only to die-hard SHE LOVES ME fans, or masochists. I'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of You've Got Mail than listen to this again
After reading her excellent Halloween book, I figured her Halloween CD would be worth owning. I always search for "different" Halloween CDs, but this was filled with the same old stuff.Chains, moans, and spooky laughs... then more chains, moans and spooky laughs. Very dissapointing
Neither the Amazon review or any of the customer reviews recently submitted mention this fact. I have few classical and pop recordings in mono that do not impact the listening experience such as 'Songs for Swinging Lovers' - Frank Sinatra or Beethoven's Opera Fidelio - conductor Otto Klemperer (Testament Label). The material on these recordings are so good that the listener completely ignores the fact that they are mono recordings. I did not hear anything outstanding on this CD to make me overlook the 'mono' factor. Is this some great jazz masterpiece, recorded live in Carnegie Hall by two giants of Jazz? I personally don't think so. Somehow this material remained in obscurity for all this time and somebody by accident discovered this gem - if you believe that then Elvis is alive and the earth is exactly 6000 years old.With small jazz bands, I like to listen to the musicians communicate with each other within the context of a thesis. Examples: 'Sunday at the Village Vanguard - Bill Evans Trio' or 'New York Reunion - McCoy Tyner Quartet'. I wanted to but could not hear anything of this sort in this recording. This material is more likely to be understood only by the performers themselves and the real jazz aficionados. It may have been hasty but after one listen I decided to sell this CD and I have no regrets other than buying it in the first place.
I don't want to hear any more of their music on the radio. It is all just nonsense, and none of it should have ever been made. They are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory
The main problem I have with this CD is that it seems poorly mixed. There is no sonic depth to it - all the sounds are flat and hard to distinguish from each other
Man, have I given this guy a chance.  Multiple chances.  Listened to the CDs, saw the big HBO special.  I mean, his career is red hot now.  He clearly has lots of fans.  Mostly college age (perhaps this should be a warning to some of you).  All I can say is "maybe they'll grow out of it."  He is NOT funny.  His act has no bite, no point of view, no opinion/viewpoint at all.  His comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to (the "this is all happened to us" or "has this ever happened to you?" school of humor).  He runs about manically, acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth (for those in the audience that may not be so good with words).  His fans acknowledge that, yes, they can relate.  "Yeah!  That's happened to me!"  "I know that reference!'  They laugh, cheer, clap, and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit.  He never actually COMMENTS on the things he discusses in any intelligent, interesting way.  He has no edge.  He's not outraged by anything.  He's cute 'n' cuddly.  Richard Pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that Cook is classified as a stand up comic.  "Pryor?  The guy writing this must be OLD!'  Okay, try this on for size:  Chris Rock is good comedy.  Same with Dave Chappelle.  Carlin.  Laura Kightlinger.  Kinison.  Rodney Dangerfield.  Bob Saget.  Gilbert Gottfried.  Dom Irrera.  Lewis Black.  Robert Klein.  The late Mitch Hedberg.  Jim Norton.  Patton Oswalt.  Brian Posehn.  DeGeneres.  Jon Stewart.  Bob  David.  The UCB.  I'm not even a big fan of Sarah Silverman, but at least she's trying to bring something different to the party.  Anything but this!  God help us.  Let's hope he goes the way of Carrot Top and Dice soon (don't forget, Cook fans, Mr. Top and Mr. Clay were once as popular as your boy here)
When I think of the sex pistols, I think the Monkeys did it better as a boy band. Let's face it, dears, that is all the sex pistols were: a marketing ploy. They are f-----g NSync for another generation
This one is for you.  But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal.  So  guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake.  Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens.  in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that.  Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring.  I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par
Bought this CD based upon the reviews and the fact that they were recommended with some other albums I like, and man, what a mistake. This CD borders on unlistenable, with no discernable melody/talent to be found. I'm hardly some ignorant pop-music lover...I consider "Blueberry Boat" to be one of my favorite records - but this is just horrible
This is not necessarily an indictment of Aimee Mann or holiday music....though I do find such disks as being cheesey. I was a bit surprised when I heard Mann was coming out w/a holiday album.  It seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only  original material, but non-mainstream music.  It has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year.  Is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with?  There is only so many different ways to cover "I'll Be Home for Christmas", "Winter Wonderland" - all of which I believe are covered by James Taylor, Sarah McLachlan and Better Midler, all of which were released this month.  I'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits.That being said - I still like Mann's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray.  "Whatever Happened to Christmas", "Christmastime" and her original "Calling on Mary".  I also liked the fact that she covered "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch".  That seems to suit her more.Not my cup of tea - but the songs I mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars
This CD is awesome from beginning to end.  I really enjoy listening to this type of music.  This CD is a must have. 
Great cd. Imus in the morning recommended highly and the I-man was not wrong. One of the best cd's I've owned in years. I listen to a lot of Buffett, James Taylor, Delbert McClinton, and this cd places high in these ranks
This collection of 15 great hits of Nicola Di Bari in spanish is missing one of his most (if not the most) important and popular song: Lisa de los ojos azules. I wouldn't buy this CD without that song
I have not heard of or listened to, this cd series, but from the sound of it, its all bad interpretations of popular music.  I just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff... play classical music.  Play stuff without lyrics.  Play a show on tv where the characters sing.  Do anything but, buy a cd where people that aren't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place.  Censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song.  There are just some songs that aren't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words.  Think about this... do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song?  Listen... I'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible, but cds like this are not the way to go.  All they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff, they're gonna be asking questions.  Do them and yourself a favor and don't buy these cds
This album is the worst DCFC album, why......... Ill tell you why its boring, its repetitive, its way to mellow and im all for mellow but this is ridculous. I mean this is the type of mellow that puts people to sleep, especially the last track. OH MY GOD!!! THAT SONG IS SOOOOO BORING, its called Stability and it will put you to sleep. I am a fan of DFCF and i loved their other albums WE HAVE THE FACTS, PLANS, etc..... but honestly this album did not click with me. i tried listing to the songs again to see if i would probably grow accustome to it, but no that didnt work. Sure this album has its moments, but trust me when i say your not missing out on anything. I would not buy the album, instead buy the 2 stand out songs off itunes or napster; A MOVIE SCRIPT ENDING and WE LAUGH INDOORS. The only 2 stand out tracks
The CD is great!!! The legendary Johnny Cash comes thru loud and clear on this CD. However, it took Amazon over 30 days to deliver this item and that was only after numerous emails to them. Their attitude of "just wait a few more days and email us again" was both insulting and annoying. Thank goodness this wasn't a Christmas gift for someone.
I bought this cd after hearing Tony on one of the am morning shows, and really likings some of his past offerings, but I have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money.  I was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money's worth.  Tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years, and I expected a more mature offering from him than this latest.  There is a great lack of maturity on this cd, and it's an overall disappointment.  Unfortunately, I have to say here that Toney is not alone.  What on earth possessed veteran soul singers the O'Jays to sing a song like Let's Ride?  Who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages?  Hoochie mommas?  What?  Babyface?  Even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd!  And what's up with the explicit lyrics?  We all know you can curse like sailors, but why is this language necessary in music?  And I know that artist have always performed their music, but will someone tell me why it's necessary to perform with so few clothes on?  I would rather hear your music, not see your booty! Sorry, but a review I just read triggered me, and I'd been thinking about the Tony Terry cd for a while.  Hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time.  Meanwhile I think you're safe in skipping this particular cd
As if the song for mesmerize was'nt bad enough. A F***'IN GREASE VIDEO???!!!! Ja officially became a diva with this album. This album is horrible. The pledge had some life due to Nas appearance, thats why it's hard for me to request a zero star rating. Bottomline if Ja's body was made up of his albums, this part would gangrene, maggots would avoid this and you should too
I love to hear old standards and such.  But I like to hear people who put their own take on it.   I can't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some Frank Sinatra wannabe.  Where are the male versions of Nora Jones?   Tone down the cheese!  We need more people like sophisticated Shirley Horn and Betty Carter(NOT hams like Buble, Dusk, or boring singers like Diana Krall.  But what can I expect from the music industry?  Rarely do the best song-stylists get lots of attention.  So, hmmm, nevermind.  I guess it's always been that way
Um. I have nothing against bands that are "mainstream". That has nothing to do with their quality of sound. (granted, many mainstream bands are horrible, but they all deserve a chance, no?) Dave, though, he has never impressed me. Not that he's awful, I suppose it's okay background music...better than nothing. Just oh so mediocre. I don't understand why is he so highly praised? Voice-wise? Eh. Nothing special. Lyrics? Hah! Music? umm... bland? it's all the same! Maybe I'm missing something?If you like one of Dave's songs, then by all means, buy this! You can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song. Two stars because it's at least music. But that's on the high side, considering how static it is. Dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer.
Jeff Buckley sounds like what Marc Bolan would have sounded like if Bolan had taken Perry Como as his musical muse.  Seriously, think about Marc Bolan trying to sound like a '50's crooner and you'll know what Jeff Buckley sounds like
Based on other reviews here and comparisons to Jellyfish, Jason Falkner and the Beatles, I was expecting a lot better.  Instead I find this work very shrill and hard to listen to.  Is the guy talented musically?  Yes.  But his voice is mediocre and his songs really don't do it for me.  Sorry but I feel the need to give an honest assessment so others won't be mislead by the breathless reviews here.  I am a big fan of power pop and all good music but this does not rank with the best of that genre
There's a review here that compares Hank III with Hank, and then suggests that Hank III adds to the legend with his clever lyrics.  I think that person has never listened to Hank's stuff.  It's hard to compete with, "You wore out a brand new trunk, packin' and unpackin' all of your junk."  That's my favorite Hank lyric, and there are many, many more--very, very clever, very hard to compete with.  That said, I love III.  He has a hard way to go, and apparently he's going it.  I can't even imagine the dichotomy he faces--looking and sounding like Hank, and I'm sure he loves that, yet wanting to do his own stuff.  I bought his first CD as soon as I knew about it, and I've been waiting for this one.  On the first one I was disappointed with his writing (but he's a kid, for pete's sake) and was knocked out by Wayne Hancock.  On the other hand--I didn't know III existed until I saw him on Conan O'Brian, and he was one of those performers who makes your head whip around and hit the "record" button so you can find out who he is.  I've listened to everything on Lovesick Broke  Driftin' and I love it.  Except for Atlantic City--once you've heard The Band do that, you don't need anything else.  Hank III, however, is on his way, and I'm rooting for him.  He's got the stuff.  (And, by the way, to echo the sentiments of others on this board, I don't listen to country anymore, at all!  It's way too pop-commercial-boring-who cares!)  I haven't listened to a country station for more than 10 years.  Go, III.       
I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the "music" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.         
As much as it pains me to say it this live cd is not a worthy billy joel release. In fact one wonders why it was released at all. Billy's voice is strained and is prone to over singing and the arrangements are overblown. From the sound of things Billy sounds like he was drunk or on medication. A lot of the running time is waisted with lengthy monologues with the audience. Why this was put on the CD is anyones guess but it just neans less songs! However the good news is that this CD has now been blown away by his superb new 12 Gardens CD in which Billy is the Billy of old. The one who sung well and sung the songs straight as they were meant to be sung. 12 Gardens is crammed with 32 songs rather than the 26 on offer here and there's no timewaisting audience chat!!
I am very disappointed in this CD.  Not because the music isn't good, because it is.  But because it is just not the Pat Green that used to play in Stillwater.  The passionate, soulful Pat Green.  Back then he sang about things that he believed in and loved.  Now he is singing what Nashville tells him to.  And this coming from the guy who sang "Nashville Sucks" with Cory Morrow.  There are a ton of country singers out there that could have released this CD and it would have sounded exactly the same.  But songs like "Southbound 35" and "Three Day" can only be sang by Pat Green.  He needs to revisit his roots and come back to the red dirt country music that he was born to play.  Will the real Pat Green please stand up
I bought this album because I loved the title song.  It's such a great song, how bad can the rest of the album be, right?  Well, the rest of the songs are just filler and aren't worth the money I paid for this. It's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe. Kenny Chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the Nashville music scene.  He's gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town.  I'll get down off my soapbox now.  But country music really needs to get back to it's roots and stop this pop nonsense.  What country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things.
This was not as good as I had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while I am working out but the rest is good.
I was disappointed by Ms. Jackson.  Though it's not such a big loss b/c i didn't pay much for it.  None of the songs "jumped" out at me.  Thank god i didn't waste time putting this on my ipod why upset it
now, if we're being completely honest and true to the stats this album is killing the charts, but maybe just because people are lowering their standards. Besides, the fact that I dont like this girl because she is just too rough around the edges, this CD is no "Dangerously in Love". Where Beyonce's sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album, Cole's raspy voice and sometime-y pitch concern me.Aside from the obvious car banger  "I Just Want It to Be Over" and the wildly popular "Love"(which Cole butchers when singing live by the way),nothing here surprises me.  Like I said , you can call me a hater, but with women like Beyonce and Fantasia around Cole's fire will probably be put out soon
I can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album. The lyrics must have come out of a Dadaist poetry circle, and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality. What is the criterion of a good rock album? By any standards it must be a joy to play it. 6teen Stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional. But it doesn't so much incite anger than it does disdain for Bush's attempts to emulate Nirvana. Where Nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist, evocative lyrics, Bush has dull, throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger. There's not much more to say about 6teen Stone. I could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like "Swim": Thinning ice / 14 Hairdryers / Swimming to you / Flame on earth desire." Or the artistic suicide of the last track, "X-Girlfriend", a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long. That's about all I can tell you. Mostly I figure I've done enough warning to let you make your own choice. If you do attempt this though, you ought to be told the little good news that there is: there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album, split between "Machinehead" and "Glycerine." The first is an energetic, well-constructed song about control (you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on Total Request Live), the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars, a trembling cello, and a surprisingly coherent Rossdale. They hold the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building.
know here is man with absoultely no lyrical skills baby dont get with a wanksta  good girl wants a gangsta what about girls just want normal people no way can anybody like slim thugeverybody likes a pimp onli weird and freakish people do SLIM THUG ISNT A THUG IF HE WAS HE WOULD BE IN JAIL STUDO GANGSTA GANGST
I basically love anything Mr. Carter does, but this one has alot of great lyrics (as usual).  I'm so glad he's coming out of retirement.  Any fan of Jay-Z will enjoy this cd
I had never heard Leonard Cohen's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters.  Given his status/reputation I thought I should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about.Having had no preconceptions, I have to say I was quite disappointed.  I think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable.  Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best.  Specific example that speaks volumes:  listen to Cohen's singing of his "Hallelujah" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song on "Grace" which was recorded in 1994.  Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song.  It is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of Cohen's legacy.  "Tant pis, vers le bonheur.
I've listened to this piece of work several times, in many positions, on various stero systems, during different moods and I just can't understand the lyrics half the time and the arrangements were best described as 'a wall of mud'.It isn't a question of country music, or contemporary music, with ELH she has demonstrated throughout the years she just loves, and respects, GOOD MUSIC.  The music is good, the woman has impeccable taste but this time I had wished she sat in on the mixing process.I think I understand the aim of this collection but geez, I wish I didn't.  I am too accustomed to hearing ELH's clear voice slice to the heart of the lyrics, take them and present them with a totally unique perspective.  I won't start on her own playing because this review would be nothing but gushing about her near-total mastery of her craft.  She's an amazing woman, artist and collaborator -- I love her because she is everywhere in music: supporting new artists, doing background for others, her duets are gems of generosity with respect for her fellow artists, while always doing what's best for the song.  I just hope there's no follow up to WB.  I'm very happy with my other 8 ELH cds and I'm in awe of 'All Roads Running' and my [...]is going to be front center next week in Los Angeles.  It's like waiting for Xmas
Chingy is perhaps the most generic rapper in the world, he is a wack lyricist and all he ever talks about is gettin pu*sy.  Along with several other wack commercial rappers of recent years he tarnishes the name of hip hop, and because of retards like this non hip hop listeners dismiss the genre as cr*p and talentless (which is not true).  Jackpot went multi platinum, which speaks volumes about the number of idiots who will buy anything with a tight beat.  In fact the beats aren't all that bad, if this was an instrumental this would actually get a higher rating as I would not have to listen to his irritating voice.  If you heard Right Thurr in a club and thought it was tight (like I did), you are wrong, Chingy did not produce this album so he deserves no credit for the beats.  His lyrics are absolute garbage, what is sad is that a loser like this can get decent production, and some top lyricists have to work with nothing.Compared to this album, his follow up Powerballin bombed and with any luck it will be the last we ever hear from this loser.  Find him working at a McDonalds near you soon!!
It would be impossible for me to write you a review.  I never received the subject CD.  You sent me some piece of crap dics which I sent back.  I have not received the Gene Watson CD i ordered and paid for.  If I don't get it soon, you will never hear from me again.  Edward N Clark - Herrin, I
No need to say more, these f@gs are just making lousy punk pop for the teenage girls and mtv watching kids who think they're quite rebel with listening to this kind of sheit, and these suckers do it just for the money like green day or blink 182. There just have to be some stuff like this to fill all the pop and mtv charts
I used to like good charlotte, enough that i bought this CD, but i really don't like them at all anymore.  They try to look all punk, but they are pop.  They whine a lot.  I think it's time to get over the fact that their dad left and they were uncool.  they should at least stop doing songs about it.  They have some ok melodies and words, but for the most part all their songs sound the same.  Good Charlottes first two CD's were almost good, but this one is bad and really whiny
This album is lame as hell but next to the air pollution on the airwaves today, this aint too bad thats why it gets a 2. Right before female rappers(there's a few exceptions), I hate all little kid rappers. Even when I was a kid. I don't like anything on this album, I still got the tape and it hasn't "krossed" my mind to even cop the cd. If you like this kind of stuff, or you loved "jump" back in the day then I guess this is for you
There used to be a time when rap was not synonymous with the likes of Hillary Duff. No longer is that true, if you call this rap. Puff wasn't that good to begin with, and I never owned any of his cds but I knew of him...anyway, by the time I heard he changed his name to PDiddy, I about laughed until I pissed myself. (...
This soundtrack was `heart-brokenly' disappointing to me mainly because it lacks a few songs that were in the film.  I bought this soundtrack for one specific song (and it would've been worth every penny if only it was included): the song near the end when Alexander marches through the desert to return home to Babylon after his recovery.  Such a disappointment that wasn't included.  In the other hand, I'm satisfied with some of the tracks that were included.  I particularly liked "Roxane's Veil" even though I don't recall hearing it in the film.    
This album made me realize that darn record company produces, for examle, two regular albums; two best albums; two tribute albums; and finally two mixture of everything under a sounds-like-new-but-actually-an-old albums  from a musician. This is an example of the mixture of previously released,  re-released, at last, over-released best tracks with a sounds-like-regular  album title.  Let me tell you one thing. JP is dead and gone since Rob left  the band. I doubt there will be more regular JP albums but you'll have  plenty of compilations like this coming out until you stop buying
AFI used to be a pretty good band. Then, they decided to go emo-girlie-boy. The lead singer has made adramatic change from smelly-goth-dude to perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy. What happened to smeely-goth-dude? Some of us actually like the music, not the "emoness". Not only that, but "Miss Murder" was waaaaay overplayed, and now it is encrested into my brain. I mean, come on, it's not even that good of a song.AFI is looking to appeal to the mainstream. There's nothing wrong with that, if you keep your old sound, which this band has failed to do. This, my friends, is AFI's worst album, if not hte worst album of 2006.Check out the older AFI stuff. "Sing The Sorrow" is okay, but if you want truley good music, you have to go back into their ninties albums
Despite all the rave reviews I'm wondering if this is a dreaded rerecord. Maybe I'm paranoid, but the country music industry is so sleazy. And some stars feel entitled to cash in. How else can you explain the John Anderson Anthology...Horror.  (John, how could you?) Or the Bill Anderson Oh Boy Classic [Oh boy here comes a rerecord). Hey, the CD sounds great. But what makes me suspiscious is that there are no copyright dates anywhere on this CD except for one. Also the cryptic message on the inside sleeve.  Could someone please clear this up. And not some RCR Bud Logan shill either. John Conlee is one of my hero's and this is really worrying me. I can't look at this CD with Rose Colered Glasses anymore
This music is a rip off. All is borrowed to the 4 first albums of Marc Bolan playing under the name of Tyranosaurus Rex. Something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy. A shame
I bought this album after hearing America, their single off this album, and listening to the increasing hype about Razorlight and Johnny Borrell being one of the most talented singer-songwriters of his generation. This follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. The songs all sound like I've heard them somewhere before, and the lyrics - well, how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone, nothing on the radio, and not known what it all meant, while smoking cigarettes late at night. Yawn...
The Kidz Bop series is the ultimate travesty in music. And don't think that it's good just because your kids might love it. Kids also like to eat McDonalds, but don't try telling me that their food is healthy. There is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children. And, surprisingly, a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children, even with the expletives deleted. There is no reason on earth why these records should exist, excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish. I agree with the person who suggested the Beatles as an alternative. Seriously, don't buy this!
Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money
I am a huge fan of BTNH, but even I will admitt this is not a good album. The worst being "Home" which uses samples from Phil Collins. The whole thing feels kind of empty, with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works. There are a few songs worth listening to. Most notably is "Clevland is the City" which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any "harmony" to it. Other songs worth mentioning are "What About Us", "Not my baby" and "Pump,Pump",the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage. It is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released
Maybe her harp playing could be acceptable, but when she sings... everything turns awful. The worst singer I ever heard
This CD is not at all what it appears to be. They got other people singing and playing the music, so it's not what you're probably looking for. Terrible misrespresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I used my other party cd's or my guests would have left......and I would have held the door open.....not blamed them for leaving!
Wild Card is the best song on this cd.  The rest just didn't do it for me and I didn't care for the Latin flavor.  This cd was a mess.  If the rest of the songs were along the lines of Wild Card, I would have kept the cd.  This didn't say Rippingtons to me.
GNR were a very overrated band. I found Appetite For Destruction very dull. This atleast has the band's 3 GREAT songs in November Rain, Civil War, and Live And Let Die. Get this for 3 great songs but stay away from GNRS OTHER CRAPPY SONGS AND ALBUMS!! THEY ARE NOT METAL!
After carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on Amazon and reading all reviews I had hoped I had made a good choice with this CD.  Unfortunately I discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my Bose Tri-Port headphones.  As a recording engineer I recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground.  The bottom line is I hear this rumble each and everytime I start to relax and it renders the CD completely useless to me.  The recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic.  Since nobody else has complained of this rumble, I will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear
Very possibly the worst CD I have ever heard in my life. I could barely FORCE myself to listen until the last song was blissfully over.This is not music. It is stupid noise!
Out of all of the early '90s, L.A. gangster flicks, this one probably had the best set of Chicano oldie tracks.  The movie was laced with them, yet none are on the soundtrack.  Kind of a waste.Sure, you can get those oldies anywhere.  But it would be nice to have those songs from this movie on one cd.  Again, it was a good sequence they used.  Aside from that;  It's okay, I guess, if you're a fan of b-list L.A. Chicano rappers.  But, even if you are, you can get better music from their respective albums.  LSOB's first CD from '91 was tight.  If you have that, then you're really not missing anything by letting the  'Loca' soundtrack pass.   
Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original.Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya
Rob touches on so much with this CD.  My favorite song is one that hasn't got any airplay and, in my opinion, the public missed out a great hit!  "Streetcorner Symphony" is about people coming together. It's what I call my happy song.  Each day as I go to work I play the song as loud as I can get it!  We, my daughters and I, saw him live and he also called it a happy song!  I can't wait for his live albulm to come out! There are fast and slow songs on this CD and will be worth EVERY PENNY you spend to buy it! Incredible voice and songwritting
however despite what Amazon reviewer Kristy Martin may believe, Ms Croft does not need to get her freak on. Wow. I guess hip hop can do no wrong. In a soundtrack which is filled with apporpriate trax to supplement the film, here comes another fanboy/girl of hip hop's hopele$$$ley misplaced garbage. Thank you Kristy for proving to be yet another white suburban supporter of the most mass marketed crap to come along. (Missy)This song is soo done it's practically taboo to listen too. And Outkast? Puhf_ckingleez. These clowns sold out a long long time ago
This was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the Mid Nineties G-Funk heyday. Warren G. didn't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard/soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before. The skits are ridiculous, the music is halfass, and the lyrics are amateur. There is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener's attention for a whole album. This is similar to other West Coast rap albums that play it too safe such as W.C. and the Madd Circle's debut and Coolio's "It Takes A Thief". One star for the hit single "Summertime in the L.B.C.".
 Any group that is so lacking in imagination that it has to steal as unusual and distinctive a song title as "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" (a 1934 hit song) deserves to be ridiculed, not rewarded with a Grammy. I'm just full of original ideas. I can't decide whether to write a song called "Wake Me Up Before you Go-Go" or "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer" - or maybe "Do You Know The Way to San Jose"? 
I did not like this cd at all.  There was not even one song that I liked.However, given the positive result the cd received, it may just have been my personal taste.  I also got her new cds, and did not like those eithe
I woke up this morning to the grating sounds of "Good Little Girls" blaring over my clock radio's single, worn-out speaker.  A speaker that has helped introduce some great songs over the past year, such as "There Goes My Life" and "Live Like You Were Dying".  "Good Little Girls" is easily the worst country song I've ever heard - and I thought Neal McCoy was bad!  Blue Country is the C equivalent of Wham!  (a dated reference to be sure)Maybe I'm just getting too old for country music
I agree with all the other reviewers .. nice quality recording for its time considering it was in the vaults for decades ..great playing  from all concerned(except the  cursed Drummer) , I cannot imagine what poor Jerry Gemmot went through with THAT DRUMMER .. he should have been  dismissed immediately ..or shot ..it would have sounded better without him .. Gawd' awful .. spoils the whole dang thing .. any way .. I cannot listen to this anymore without getting uncomfortable , so it's back to Soul Of A Man , Re-Kooperation ,  Live Adventures , Super Session , and Kooper Sessions with Shuggie 
Any one who is a fan of Luther Vandross will be sorry if you purchase this CD.  It's not a tribute.......it an abomination
Anyone ever see any of these rap "artists" perform live? They're the most boring, derivative "entertainers" in the world. They walk up and down the stage grabbing their crotch and YELL their lyrics. They go from talking on records to yelling on stage. Quite a stretch. All this is done with about thirty of their no-name friends prancing around stage with microphones saying "YEAH!" "UH-HUH!" "WHAT!" "THAT'S RIGHT!" "UH!" etc. Get real.Meanwhile, the only "music" provided is a backing track cued by some dude backstage. It makes for the most dull, predictable "concert" you'll ever see. I can't wait until all this nonsense just disappears. In a world of common sense, these idiots would still be flipping burgers at McDonald's.
and he's a super-talented drummer. The day the Foos release a best-of compilation I'll probably pick it up. Otherwise, I'm sad to say that the average Foo Fighters album cut just doesn't cut it for me. All of the songs on THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE are mediocre, run-of-the mill "alternative" rock. Only "Stacked Actors" has some real songwriting substance and it does have some swagger and bite, but to be perfectly honest, it still isn't a huge turn-on in my book. "Learn to Fly," the other track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio, may as well have been written by The Outfield or some other average rock band along those lines. I almost gave this album two stars, but unfortunately I think that rating would be just too generous.Foo Fighters HAVE made some really good songs, like "Everlong." But I honestly don't think they'd be nearly as big if Grohl hadn't drummed for one of the most highly revered and charismatic bands of all time, NIRVANA. Elsewhere, their fantastic cover versions such as Gary Numan's "Down in the Park" and Prince's "Darling Nikki" suggest they are great rockers but less great in the songwriting department
This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable, emotionally charged pep rally.  It really upsets me that this is the face of today's Christian music.  The melodies are not easily singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches.  This is worship manipulation at it's best.  If you read the words to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of substance.  They talk about actions to give God and our response to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this.  God IS great, but WHY?  This is VERY disturbing, and completely unacceptable for congregational worship. 
I was hoping to hear the rockin' spanish flavor of the Robert Rodriguez band Chingon, but what the hell is this?!!!  The Amazon recomendations lead me to this album, and hinde sightI should have read a little more before buying, but I was too excited to hear more of the Rodriguez Chingon.I hope this helps you
With Perverse, Mike Edwards set out to prove that Jesus Jones was more than a `sunny, breezy pop band', what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. Sad to say, but pop hooks were what people expected from JJ, and actually there are some here, but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. Stick with DOUBT, that's where JJ peaked, even if some claimed they had `sold out'. Here they are pushing the boundaries, but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience
This album is disgusting.No musical talent.  This people are the farthest thing from musicians.  If you enjoy overproduced music, and a rip off of fellow label mates FOB and P!ATD - buy this.  It is boring and it is a weak attempt at a record.  Shaant can't sing either.  Go back to Buffalo
I thought something must be wrong with my stereo when I first played this cd.  Brooks and Dunn have created some great work, but this is far from it.  Many of the songs are so dischordant, I would  swear that the studio engineer had gone tone deaf or something.  About two decent songs, the rest are not worth having around.  Try some earlier stuff for a better taste of their talent
While some would call Orange and Acme "studio" albums, suggesting that they lack originality, but they have rythm. I would call myself a big JSBX fan, I play Orange and Acme constantly, however I feel that this album is a little too much free form, and free noise for the everyday listener. I would recommend that anyone interested in JSBX start with Acme and then move on to Orange to develop an appreciation for JSBX, because it is a rather acquired taste
Too Lisa Loeb for me. Sorry. Maybe if someone else wrote her lyrics
See Bonnie Raitt be slowly overtaken by the blahs, actually one is temped to think the album will be cool when listening to `The Fundametal Things', but no
Metallica were simply one of the worst most overrated and pathetic bands ever. Most of their trite albums deserve no stars. Their only good cds are either Master of Puppets, or Black Album. KILL EM ALL is such a bore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! James Hetfield, the lead singer just screams and can't sing at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Why???? Why can't he sing more proper like Lou Greamm(Foreigner),  Mark Knopfler(Dire Straits)????????Each and every song on this album is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Don't listen to the people who rate Metallica's albums a five star. They are overrated....Green Day is better. Get Them, Dire Straits, and Foreigner insted.Ps. This album is worth a minus trillion.
Back 2 Da Basics *1/2 StarsYo Gotti has made some decent albums, but this one is just so ridiculous and silly that it made me sick, gotti who thinks he put memphis on the map, has some good songs here and there, but the rest are just ridiculous, obnioxus and real pretentious.This is not a good albumThumbs Down
Simon  Garfunle wrote a lot of forgettible music(most notably for the film The Graduate, which would have been a better film without thier dated msuic).  This cd dates very badly as all thier music does, it's got a very limited appeal, only for diehard fans, but beware thsi music really sounds DATED, I mean it's really unlistenable
he just needs to retire. screw this non-gangsta. no real G sings, they just rap, GOD
This CD Is garbage. Juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album. He was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one. If I was you dont listen to the retards who tell you "this is a good comeback album" . Instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend Welcome Back by Mase. That is a good comeback album. The only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of Mannie Fresh. Juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats. A shame they couldn't go to Ja rule, whose CD sucked with his beats. He has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow
I've never written a review, but I just wanted to let you know if you buy this album you are a complete idiot, and you're killing Hip-Hop. Stop killing my music
Robin Gibb has one of the most distinctive voices of the 1960s. With the BEE GEES or as a solo artist he has enough hits to make his own live show. However, in this LIVE recording he chooses to recreate mostly BEE GEES hits on which he had a secondary role on their famous three part harmonies. Thus he needs the help of another lead singer, chorus and The Neue Philharmonie Frankfurt Orchestra. But everything goes wrong here: Robin's voice remains buried among a real bulk of unmixed music; the lead singer (no list of credits) is a poor substitute to Barry Gibb's famous falsetto; the female voices are not very inspired, to say the least; while the orchestra is frequently out of tune and noisy (the winds on Juliet are really unbearable). Post-production seems to be non-existent and the overall sound is chaotic. Lines notes by experts Andrew Mon Hughes and Ann Grootjans are interesting and illustrative, but they seem to belong to another album. The message from Robin Gibb seems to be clear: "I can do it all by myself". Well, he cannot. He should re listen to ONE NIGHT ONLY (1998) and check for sound, harmonies and production
Presumably the label is trying to cater to mid-range fans who have a Prince album or two but don't want to buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits collection. The way this is laid out though is confusing at best:Disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen are questionable. ("My Name is Prince"? His take on "Nothing Compares 2 U" when Sinead O'Connor's is definitive?) Disc 2 compiles 12" mixes and remixes and similar rarities..i.e. for the diehard only who has to have every little bleat His Purpleness every records.BOTTOM LINE:This is haphazardly thrown together. Middle range fans are better off with THE HITS/THE B-SIDES which compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection of interesting flip side material (some of which equals his singles)
There is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on Amazon- you wouldn't buy if you could. I read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that Metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way. This band is nothing even near Metallica. I have thrown the disk away- don't bother
I can't beleive this guy's arrogance to try and re-record songs that are essentially and always will be Sinatra's domain. Any idiot will tell you that once Sinatra got hold of a song it was and always will be identified with him. Fact. Ask Tony Bennett or any other great singers and they will tell you. Sinatra IS the voice and then this upstart thinks he can do better. Not only does he murder 'a very good year' but also attempts (badly) 'mr. bojangles' even attempting to ape Sammy Davis's mannerisms. I had the misfortune to hear this once and came to the conclusion that is was a)a joke or b) a blantant attempt by Williams to crossover to boarder appeal. Now i see it actually meant it. Robbie you will never be able to sing standards and please don't attempt the Rodgers and Hart songbook (though i suspect you will if your latest album bombs) your voice is flat most of the time and your attempts to look cool on the cover can't cover up your mediocrity. The only time i'd like to see you swing is from a lamppost. Stick with 'songs for swinging lovers''come fly with me' to hear the real thing. An insult to classic songs
Listening to this album made me question my own life.  It is simply unoriginal, boring and really bad.  Save your money
The lack of someone lurking behind Prince's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the Fargnoli management team. This is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster. Musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to Sade also make the feel of this track disjointed. While Prince fans will generally hype this track, the reality is that "4 the tears in your eyes" this isn't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass. Lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121.  
I love south music like three 6, lil jon, master p, but this is a disgrace to every rapper alive and dead. Man JD is just signing anyone these dayz to make money cuz he can't get no one wit talent. every song on here sounds like it was hurried up. Fu*k so so de and fu*k dem franchize boyz they make me sick.
all i got to say about this is that dudes need to stop making this kinds of records cuz this is not hip hop, its not what LL, Rakim, KRS-one, Kool G Rap, Ice T, Ice Cube, NWA, and (rip) BIG AND PAC, started.  We as fan have the power to end this buy simply not buying the album.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS, THIS FAKE RAP IS GOT TO STO
A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title). Ja tries to be "gangstafied" on this album but fails terribly. Starting with the first single "Me  You" thinking his thug style can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat falling track "F*** You" featuring Vita and 01?Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity. How about the song "Put It On Me" before Lil Mo joined song. Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song "Extacy" (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). Oh and remember when "Between Me  You" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook, but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the album.  Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out. "6 Feet" is a standout track, and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. "Watching Me" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of energy within him. "I Cry" and as mentioned earlier "Extacy" are decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album are skippable.Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap ("Put It On Me" [Remix]). To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already.Lyrics: CProduction: C+Guest Appearances: C-Musical Vibes: D-Favorite Tracks: Watching Me, 6 Feet, Die, ExtacyHonorable Mention Track : Chris Black (skit
Not what I expected.  It wasn't as 'manly' as I had hoped
can it be that people are letting their personal beliefs block the receptors in the brain that signal bad music?  ive listened to many bob dylan albums, and every one is a gem.  freewheelin' is my favorite, but so what?  it doesn't matter which ones we love, because we all know what bob dylan's worst record was, and its saved.  im not one to question this man's beliefs or anything like that, bob dylan deserves all the respect in the universe, but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer to christian music to help us all see how bad it is?  could he have made the transfer to make a mockery of the christian faith?  almost certainly not.  but only a seriously bad album could have planted these seeds in my brain
I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist. My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that "very best of" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee. Some reviewers are saying there's "heart and soul" all over this album? That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too. As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very "modern" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on.Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new "very best of" collection)
THIS ALBUM IS OKAYNOT THEIR BEST.A FEW SONGS ARE GOODOTHER THAN THAT THIS ALBUM IS FAIR.PURCAHSE IT WITH YOURMONEY INTELLIGENTLY!!!!!!!!
You know, after REALLY trying to like this album, I must agree with K Johnson. Oftentimes a really good album sounds horrible (or just plain plain) upon one or three spins, so when this album didn't move me the first time, I decided to hang back and try again in a few days. Then again. And again. And one more time. Usually after three or four COMPLETE spins (which was like work, with this one)the jems will work there way to the surface. Sufjian Stevens was like that. So was Z by My Morning Jacket. But the problem was that I really wanted to like this one. All the reviews I read were hyping this as the album of the decade, and I wanted them to be right.Unfortunately, none of them were right. It is a plodding, lifeless album wanting desperately to be 'hip' and failing miserably, to the point of being embarassing almost. Like your 40 something hipster college prof with a graying ponytail (who will LOVE this, by the way), it will be pointless to argue with those who like this album. I have to say that it is obvious these guys put a lot of work into this, and they do have talent; it just doesn't get me there. I hope they can live up to the hype next time. I truly do..
On an episode of Seinfield that is probably overexposed enough as it is, the always wily and oh so goofy character of Kramer is playing a game of Risk and exclaims that the "Ukraine is weeeeak".  This causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble.  I think the same basic sentiments work with this New Order release.  It probably wasn't worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent "Rock The Shack" and of course "Crystal", which I'll get back to later.  Unlike Kramer I feel I can make this statement safely as I'm not dealing with a burly, alcohol swigging Ukranian, but New Order fans, which aren't the most intimidating bunch out there.  Keyboardist Gillian Gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important, which it is, maybe.  This album features the guitar of Billy Corgan, the frontman of the seminal 90's group Soundgarden.  Too bad they couldn't get Billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy, and wasn't writing very good material or really using his guitar, at all.  New Order also made the mistake of having Corgan to backing vocals.  Now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough, but to top that off with a Billy Corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice.  So...Someone Like You is more or less unlistenable.  It has some pretty terrible lyrics about how Bernard doesn't want to wash his car.  Now I can relate, I wouldn't want to wash my car in Britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair, but this topic doesn't result in the most captivating and well-written material.  New Order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album, something they don't do very often, just like Van Morrison.  Now I'm not sure if I've heard a Van Morrison song but I've always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars.  Case in point of this `not so good of an idea rawking' is Rock The Shack.  Rock The Shack kind of sounds like New Order's take on someone commissioned to write an epic Gilligan's Island rock song, pretty amazing huh?  '60 Miles an Hour', `Primitive Notion', and `Close Range' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland.  New Order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80's artist like Depeche Mode, The Cure, and Tears For Fears (who've actually always blown).  However, they do succeed fully well on two songs here.  There is `Crystal', which is truly an excellent rock song and show New Order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of New Order's career from the 90's and beyond.  How this didn't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me, because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it.  The other is Run Wild which is really a great little slow song, in the vein of `As It Is When It Was.  Probably New Order's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic, moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album.  Get Ready is good beginning and end, just not end between.  Kind of like that movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me
Can we say, "money making ploy?"  WoW.  I, like many others, have grown up with Disney.  Perhaps I simply do not understand why kids of any age would listen to this garbage as opposed to the actual movie songs?  This is not like "Kidz Bop" or anything related to that which "kidifies" music - these are timeless movie classics that did NOT need to be redone - and as a further insult, they are poorly redone.  I am very, very let down by these "Disneymania" albums. :o(
Hey, that just goes without being said. All of their live albums suck because they suck. Go Creed! I can't wait for Scott Stapp's solo album! Awesome, baby
Im not surprised that this album is garbage because fiddy has been putting out trash lately (think tony gayo). There are no standout tracks and prodigy doesnt even rhyme anymore. All prodigy does is spit run-on sentences throughout every track and havoc sounds like he's just there to be there. Amerikaz nightmare was a sign that it was over for them. Did we really have to hear this one to see that? If you are a mobb deep fan buy every album before amerikaz nightmre and keep it moving
..and what's the point? All of these songs (minus a few) are on the anthology, along with countless others. The Beastie Boys didn't put this out, their record label did.  It's just way for corporate to make money. If you consider yourself a real Beastie Boys fan, that is you're interested in all the other music they made that wasn't put on radio, then don't buy this.  If you occasionally heard them on the radio and Fight For Your Right is your favorite song, then go ahead. The Beastie Boys are much more than just their greatest hits.  To fully appreciate them, you have to listen to an album all the way through.
As for many of these kind of unknown groups, the music in the album is useless. In the meaning that this music has no use. It is not relaxing. It is not for contemplation. It is not spiritual. It is nothing but electronic esperiments that many vendors try to deliver under the name of "ambient". But ambient music is music. THis is crap.Well differently from TWO A.D. where probably the producers realized that crap is crap and no more crap was good to be sold, because people isn't stupid.TWO A.D. is light years away from this crap.Don't waste your money. Listen the the samples by yourself to grab what I mean.Sergi
Why are they butchering Pac's songs like this. I advise anyone to get the bootlegs over this album. The original Ghetto Gospel and Loyal To The Game are 2 of my favorite Pac songs but the one's on here are painful to listen to. Afeni should have let DJ Quik, Daz, and whoever else that worked with Pac do this album. They should have just digitally remastered the bootlegs. This started with Still I Rise to Until The End Of Time to Better Dayz and the quality has been going down and down and they hit rock bottom with this one. The 2 stars is 1 because it is Pac and another for the song Uppercut. The most obvious butcher job is Black Cotton where Em chose a fast beat and you could tell he is trying to speed up Pac's rhyme. I hope they do better with this last album due out this year
Come on.  I cannot play these dual discs in my car nor any regular CD players. J are excellent though
People buy fast food, they know its bad for them.People pay the Geek Squad 229 to do 5 minutes of work.People ALSO pay 10 bucks for words  techno beats called "pop music".Amazing, if you had this much money:go get a gym membership.Pay off your cars.Donate it to children's hospital.Why support some teen that in 2 years will die from the music scence and laugh in her mansion
Boston have to be one of the worst bands EVER!! THE SINGER SCREAMS AND THEY MADE SOME OF THE LOUSIEST SONGS LIKE ROCK N ROLL BAND, AND THE HORRIBLE MORE THAN A FEELING. THEY WOULD NOT HOLD A CANDLE TO SMART BANDS LIKE METALLICA WHO ROCK! I JUST GOT METALLICA'S 4TH LP TODAY. GET AND JUSTICE FOR ALL BY METALLICA INSTED
I have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band.  All of their records, in general, sound exactly the same, and this one is no exception.  Post-Velvets guitar/organ drones, lackadaisical vocals, blankly uninteresting non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting), and a dramatic lack of energy; all of Yo La Tengo's trademarks are fully represented here, and if you can stay awake through it, you're a better man/woman than I.  A surpassingly boring record, even from this usually very boring band.  If you've heard the Velvet Underground, Neu!, Stereolab's early records, and Sonic Youth, you've heard Yo La Tengo in total.  If you're a big enough fan of those named bands, YOU could probably write songs that sound like Painful. But you would probably write better ones. Avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia
After reading so many positive reviews, I was very exited when I recieved this cd in the mail. I popped it in my bose wave radio, turned it up to 85, and listened to the most annoying hissing sound I've ever heard coming from my system. I regret purchasing this cd
Please change your name to (KID RAP)..  When you start producing true ROCK cd's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name...  Stop playing both sides..  I realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about.. Do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music. One day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..         
This movie was only good because of two reasons.  RAMMSTEIN, and Queens of the Stone Age.  Other than that, completel out of control P.O.S. that keeps its viewers contemplating whether they have died and this movie is their eternal punishment in hell
Sarah Brightman is one of my all time favorite artists.  But this disc is just a complete waste.  It is missing so much, and has too many songs that don't belong.  Like the phantom songs.  As much as I love them, save them for the Andrew Llyod Webber collections.  Can't we have a nice singles collection with just her solo works starting from "Dive"?  Her "Classics" album had it right.  Except their version of "Captain Nemo" was the rip off live version.  And THIS cd doesn't even have the Captain Nemo song, which is a HUGE fan favorite, and definitly was a single.  It is also missing How Can Heaven Love Me, Eden, Harem, and Beautiful.  All singles as well.  Save your money.  Either buy the "Classics" album for a somewhat better compilation, or just make your own mix like I did.  Because Sarah has so many wonderful songs (And quite a few bad ones I will admit)  And it seems on here they give you some bad ones (like requium and nella fantasia), and leave out the good ones.  "It's A Beautiful Day" and "What You Never Know" are good, but are the weakest songs form Harem.  Why on earth would you leave out "Harem" and "Beautiful", but leave on Beautiful Day and WYNK?  Whoever put this set list together must have not put much thought into it and is just trying to cash in.  I bet Sarah didn't have much say in this compilation.  This is just a waste.  Beautiful album cover though
I've never been a fan of Metallica. I like Ride The Lightening, Master of Puppets, and that's it. That's the extent of my enjoyment with their abilities.However, if there is one quality I've always admired in Metallica, it is their lyrics. They've always had excellent lyrics in their songs, and that was what got me to keep buying albums.However, I can't credit them for any lyrics on this one. Unfortunately, we're dealing with a bunch of covers.Some of the songs are pretty good. The only one I can say I really like is Turn The Page, though Seger's original version is leaps and bounds ahead of it. It's got decent music, and the vocals aren't bad. Metallica just couldn't figure out how to honor a classic, and they occasionally sounded like James was trying to lift a thousand pounds while he sang, leading his voice to sound overly forced.Other songs, like Killing Time, were not spared on this album. Unlike with Turn The Page, Metallica didn't even do a halfway decent job covering this. They destroyed a pretty good song. And to be honest, Metallica's guitarist just can't compete with Sweet Savage's (Vivian Campbell??).Tuesday's Gone was also destroyed. It was too slow and acoustic, but not in the good way it was in the Skynyrd original. In this case, James' voice was terrible. It sounded like he was bleeding the entire time and trying to ignore it. That is, at least, the effect I get from it.Overall, if you're a die hard fan, you won't like this. It just doesn't have what Metallica did have for songs back with Ride The Lightening and Master of Puppets. If you're just looking for some Metallica, you might as well get this. As long as you are just a small fan, and not a huge one.Otherwise, this may come as a dissapointment
It was about time the spell Kasey Chambers originally cast on me wore off - I'd become a huge fan of The Captain and Barricades  Brickwalls, but there was all something a little nagging about even those two very good records.  Chambers, a unique betty boop squeak of a voice, was a lustrous presence in rootsy contexts, and the best moments of those records were snarky updates on an old form, but the worst moments were forgettable alt-country duldrums of patched together cliches.  Wayward Angel, Chambers' third album, had some great songs on it, but its pop and country predictability overtook a good half of the album.  Carnival shows Chambers at her weakest - sad girl anthems of generic empowerment about the rain, bad girl anthems of doin-wrong that sound about as risky as songs on The Disney channel's afternoon lineup.  "Light Up A Candle" fakes its slinkiness and turns dull, "Surrender" adds a Dido production of drum machines and computer bleeps that don't mask the song's epic ordinariness,  ballads like "Dangerous" limp along to their own generic lethargy.  Chambers isn't without charm - "Sign On The Door" and "I Got You Now" are impossible to not find fun - yet Chambers worst instincts as a song writer threaten to take over even the good songs - "Hard Road," a sad and moving movie-ready duet, borders on self-parody - lines like "There's a heavy jacket/ there's a heavy load/ there's a weight on my shoulders/ it's a hard road" read like a laundry list of related lines from every sad and moving movie-ready song you've ever heard
especially when there's a pretty girl invovled but this is just dreadful. the songs are so cheesy, her voice is out of place in half the songs. it's whiny, irritating, dull and at this point, I'm not sure who's more talented, her or her sister. they got the looks, sure, but there's lots of pretty girls in this world, doesn't mean they deserve a singing contract just to look hot on the cover of the cd.  that's the only thing that intrigued me to listening to this album.  I'm sorry Jes, but maybe u really are as brain dead as people say
Jessica is blessed with a powerful and beautiful voice, but you won't get the chance to hear it on this CD. This CD is a complete let down. It is her worst one yet! Don't get me wrong. I love Jessica, but seeing her waste her God given gift on a bunch of kitty cat songs is just so... tragic
When will amazon allow a zero stars rating????
as much as I have been a lifelong fan of black moon and buckshot in general this album just lacked the ironically titled "chemistry"between buckshot and 9th Wonder.  The beats were a bit lackluster and boring and rides that razor thin line of boring and laid back with most of the beats raiding the boredom zone.  they are working on a part two so I hope they take their times to create something permament rather than something disposable as this album was. 
I like funny rappers who have some talent at least. I do not think that his songs or the man is funny at all. And even the people that I know that enjoyed this the first couple times say that they don't like it at all by the third time. Truly bad pointless music that makes all rap music seem like a joke. Avoid this one
Tihs Album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day. I like all his other albums better I don't Know why he decided to release this crap.But the only song I really Like is hip hip qurtables
Judas Preist's 1974 debut album.This is simpley weird, i could see why the band hates this album so much...simpley becuase it is so uneven and utterly sloppy and the production sounds like they recorded it in BFI dumpster. When i first got this, i was like "What the Hell?", granted, debut albums are far from perfect, but this was just downright miserable. This sounds like a combination of Pink Floyd,Rush,Black Sabbath and Cream on an acid trip. The song ROCKA ROLLA was OK and so was ONE FOR THE ROAD, but the rest of the material was abismal. SAD WINGS OF DESTINY was such an improvment from this mess! The coolest thing about this album is the weird scrapping guitar effects Tipton makes on one of the songs! I'm surprised that this was even issued on a CD, the band doesn't even acknowlege the existance of this album and i can see why! Fortuanatly they prooved to be so much more then what this platter of stange noises provided us with. I know that there are some that like this, but not me! It is very blues based in some songs, and the most annoying thing is that some of these numbers will put you to sleep. Any one expecting a rocking metal album from the Preist will be let down by this
NO STRINGS ATTACHED IS TO MY MEMORY ONE OF THE WORST ALBUMS EVER MADE.NO ONE LISTENS TO THE STUPID BOY BANDS ANYMORE.THIS PIECE OF C@#P DOES NOT SELL EVEN A THOUSAND COPIES TODAY UNLESS THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER IS BUYING UP ALL THE MILLION COPIES HIMSELF.DONT BUY ANY ALBUM FROM N STYNC OR THE EQUALLY HORRIBLE JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE.GET ANY BEATLES ALBUM INSTEAD
Dull and uninspiring, listening to this CD I couldn't see what distinguished the Doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene. If you like The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers then be grateful that they've saved rock music from boring dross like this
  Charlotte Church had the most beautiful and captivating voice I ever heard when she debuted.  I purchased all of her albums and played them to death. This CD is horrible!  Her beautiful voice is no more as she makes no attempt to even use it.  Some of the other reviews said this release is the result of her growing up.  Ridiculous!  She could easily have kept the angelic voice as she grew.  This is simply a tragic waste of talent
I absolutely love Charlotte Church's voice, but I couldn't stand even 1 song on this CD.  She's lowered herself to a "Brittany Spears-wanna-be." Monotone songs, horrible bass, every song sounds the same.  I am extremely disappointed in this collection of music.  Buy this one and you're just wasting your money.Would the REAL Charlotte Church please come back????
The Schumann that is presented here is a forgery. Don't get me wrong. I'm not railing against Schumann at all. The question here is what makes Schumann great, and the way that Bernstein presents these symphonies says Schumann is great for the wrong reasons. The real Schumann that lived was a completely different person than what we might assume from listening to this particular presentation of his music. Schumann was not a hopeless romantic. He was one composer in a long line of "classicists" which ended with Brahms, yet at the same time he was an innovator, pushing forward, trying to find new stylistic and technical means of expression. He had plenty of dignity, and he didn't write his music as a desperate plea for the world to like him, which is exactly what it sounds like here. Bernstein trudges through these fine works as if he were dying. Yes, many of these performances are the slowest on record, but this is a BAD thing. These beautiful works lose value immeasurably when they are saturated with thick, waxy, overly romantic textures and phrasing. Tell me, did Schumann ever write: "To be played extremely histrionically and melodramatically, with the greatest possible amount of cheese and theatrics" in his score? No! HE DID NOT. These performances are not more expressive than others in the real sense of the word, and any person in his/her right mind should be able to see this. You may be able to hear the orchestration more clearly than in Karajan's filth, but that's not saying much at all. And for this slight favor Bernstein does for the music, he makes it infinitely worse when he stretches the fabric of these works beyond their limit. The most blatant example is the third movement of the second symphony, taken at half tempo. All semblance of melody and motion is lost. This movement is supposed to be several minutes shorter than the first, and not the longest movement of the symphony, not to mention the longest movement in the entire set. In fact, almost every movement of every symphony could stand to have at least a minute hacked off of its timing. Also, while looking at the scores, you might notice that Bernstein does away with detail work this time around. Carefully laid out phrasing and the dynamic arch are thrown out of the window in favor of grand "romantic" gestures. Observing details in Schumann, ironically, helps to make the music speak more freely and honestly. This isn't honest music-making here, only a self-indulgent conductor once again plastering his image over the face of great art
With the caliber of musicians playing on this album, I expected a hard hitting original. Instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of "filler" salsa. No surprises here. The classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious, you'll play this one once
Je suis un peu du par cet album... c'est morne, le son est pas top... a trane dans les longueurs... bref ennuyeux! mais bon il faut se mettre  l'poque aussi! a  qd mme 13 ans
How can ANYONE say this chick has talent?!!! My God, she is sooooooooo bad. And yes, I actually listened to it. The only reason it sounds semi ok is because she's got millions backing her and that much technology could even make me sound good! She doesn't write any of her songs and she can't hold a tune. Gives Celine a run for her money? Please!!!! The only singer she sounds better than is Paris Hilton! But whatever. If you like it, that's all that matters. If you like pretty young pop stars, Christina Aguilera is MUCH better. She can actually SING!!
Hmm sounds good, jazzy and chic. This should only be played in lounges. The only tracked I liked was amour. The rest I wanted to close my ears. Too much noise
I love this band and have all the rest of their cds
  This is another "Rip-Off" CD. 3 songs and a Video, don't make this a good purchase.  I expect a CD to have, at least, 8-10 songs on it. 
A mix of the softest chessyest mushy reggae from the 80s. Don't even bother...
I bought the CD because I thought it was instrumental music. Then I hit the tracks with vocals - Yikes!  This is the only CD of Lee Ritenour that I bought.  I am a first time listener. I must say that I do like the instrumental music very much. However, I really hate the tracks with vocals.
I would have to say that there is nothing whatsoever WRONG with the band Jet, but when you don't have any particular characteristics to call your own, there's nothing to complain about. Of course, this means that there's nothing to compliment, either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands. People compliment them on bringing the 'old' and adding the 'new...' but I hear nothing new in their music. It's just ordinary, clich�d classic rock, except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago. If I want to listen to classic rock, I want to hear it on the classic rock stations, not the modern rock stations. Those are for the new songs, only.An indepth and entertaining review of this album can be found at the Pitchfork Media website...I can't post the link due to strict review guidelines.
If you have children that are five years  younger, this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player.  but if your children are six and up.  Your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs.  This album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it.  This ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in Rwanda, Sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap.  Parents, if you buy this album, after your children turn 6 years old.  pack this CD and other Ki8dz Bop CD's and send them to Africa.  This is Pop music for impoverished folks
I REALLY,REALLY HATE FOREIGNER AND I RANK THEM AS BAD AS GREEN DAY.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS DISGUSTINGLY AWFUL CD WHICH CONTAINS TRASH LIKE WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU WHICH HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST MORONIC AND STUPID SONGS EVER.GET ANY LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM INSTEAD
First of all, I am a fan of Madonna's music (not all of it, but a lot of it) as well as a huge ABBA fan.  Now I realize that sampling has been very successful for many artists... and apparently it is here as well, but why can't these producers make something more intriguing or dynamic?  Gimme Gimme Gimme (the ABBA song that is sampled here) is a fairly simple song to begin with (as many ABBA songs are) but the complicated arrangements (both vocally and instrumentally) are what made ABBA's songs interesting and fun to listen to.  But taking a few bars of the original song, repeating it over and over and over, adding a dance beat, various other musical effects and a new melody does not add up to a pop masterpiece.  I think she would've been better off either following a similar chord progression to Gimme Gimme Gimme or just doing a cover... Perhaps Benny and Bjrn should've stuck to their strict "no sampling" rule here!  For some reason many of today's dance/pop songs get too caught up in the production and lack any real substance... A good example of a radio-friendly dance/pop song with a somewhat complicated chord structure is Acoustic Alchemy's "So Kylie" on their American/English album (the song sounds simple enough but if you really listen to what's going on, you'll notice subtle chord changes and a really nice progression).  Now I'm not going to say "Hung Up" is a terrible song, because everyone has their own taste.  But I'm sorry to say it just doesn't do anything for me..
Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... "LMN"(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.Track 5 - Ugh.Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, "As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word "radio" and we'll double what we're giving you." Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.Flame away, kiddies.
I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan; so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a free listen.  But make no mistake - this CD under-delivers on many levels.  I always wanted Asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player (Steve Howe), a top-shelf drummer (Carl Palmer), and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task (John Wetton).  But there was always a bit too much "pop", simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me.  Hey, progressive rock is mostly about "different", complexity and change, right?  Asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later albums of Todd Rundgren's Utopia) that made good music, but didn't really pioneer much of anything.  Same with this CD.  There's little here that's new or better than the studio versions of the songs.  Palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while.  Steve's acoustic solos can be found on other Yes recordings, and done much better there  -  here, the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times.  (Honestly, I remember hearing better fidelity from my old Kenner Close'n'Play!)  O.K., it WAS cool to hear Steve express his pleasure at playing in Buffalo again!  But the so-called "keyboard solo" by Geoff Downs was underwhelming to say the least, and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos.  I guess if one loves a band too much, they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any CD by that band, and that's just fine for those people.  However, the OBJECTIVE reality of this CD's value comes creeping in on many other's existing reviews:  namely, the production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!); this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions.  This is for Asia completists only.  Asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop CD with their first studio album.  I love it.  But they never improved upon it, and never stretched out into new territory.  Perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from "good" to "great".  Support your local library.  (And in this case, save some cash!)
Clipped, petite and looking more like a leather bar Anne Murray, Crow drags out the hits and the `friends' for this all-star live bash. Half the album is standard issue and straight ahead stage sweat with the morning beer-buzz afficiando going it alone without a little help from her friends (All I Wanna Do, Everyday Is a Winding Road, A Change Would Do You Good, Leaving Las Vegas). With only slight variations on these overplayed originals (a sychopantic crowd and some tinkering with the rhythms) Crow's solo chores rarely rate more than a grudging ho-hum. The rest of the album is a parade of snap-on tools (Dixie Chicks, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Sarah McLachlan, Chrissie Hynde) who easily steal the spotlight from their downhome hash-slinging waitress/host. Reduced to the role of supporting guitarist, Crow butters the toast from the sidelines as femme contemporaries like Nicks (who unravels admirably on Gold Dust Woman), Hynde and McLachlan flounder about the mike in a haphazard hit (Hynde's If It Makes You Happy)-and-miss (McLachlan's The Difficult Kind) headbutt at Crow's hits. But it isn't until Clapton's suspendered, cigar-chomping husk is rolled out to update Cream's White Room that the sour stench of monstrous micalculation reaches it's devastating climax. Fresh from watering the daisies and still in his jammies, Clapton's return to the electric psychedelics of his Paleolithic past  is a fumbling bumbling fiasco unleashed with the grace and finesse of a diarrhetic Brontosaurus. It's horrifying to think that this is what Cream would have sounded like if they hadn't broken up. Thank God for egos. It's almost a relief to hear Richards mindlessly croak his way through the old Stones Exile-era toss-off Happy, as if a cadaverous ex-junkie with the durability of a cockroach and nine lives would be anything but. Besides, Richards provides wonderful comic relief and criticizing his artistic capacity is as futile as pointing out the flaws in the bandages on an Egyptian mummy. The wrapper finds the entire gang, from Spanky Nicks to Buckwheat Clapton, joining hands for a bizarre entreaty with a kindergarten  rendition of Dylan's Tombstone Blues - a fitting finale if there ever was one
This album contains only rap and no rock songs.  This was very disappointing to say the least
Their new stuff is even worse. But this is still sexist, boring, annoying music at its worst. There are much better artists out there, so why listen to these two untalented rappers
This is the #1 Worse Song of 2006 (#2 is "SexyBack" by Justin Timberfake). For real. His voice is awful and I don't know who is worse: James Blunt, Macy Gray, or Shakira. Imagine the three of them doing a performance together on a stage. It would be pure he11
Ya, Abomination to God also set it right in his worthy review. I remember the days where this panzy was praised and all of you ate that "One Call Away" and "Right THURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR" garbage. Does 2 stars explain anything? This apparently is equal to that D4L s***, which is actually the lowest of the low. Anyways, didn't I tell you Chingy would die one year after -Jackpot- hit? Now that he's dead, everybodies focused on T-Pain, OH S***!  
Lonestar didn't really surprise me with their 2001 effort.  I'm Already There and Not A Day Goes By suffers from "Amazed" syndrome.  Amazed's 1999 multi-format mega success is spread all over this album, their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad.  Did they listen to Monster Ballads 2 too much while making this album in Nashville? I'm Already There comes off as very Diane Warren-ish in its sappy lyrics.  Their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay, but these songs don't work for them.  These songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this. 
Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious. Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD ("Encore", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well). D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them. That's the case here
A lot of people are saying that this album is better than their 1st one. That's not saying much because their 1st album was terrible. There was only one direction they could go -- up. It's hard to imagine them doing worse than their first LP. I said this about the Young, Fly,  Flashy album, and the same applies here, so I'll say it again: When the hottest line on your entire album comes from Bow Wow, your album is in serious trouble. But let me balance that statement though. This isn't exactly one of those album you buy when you want lyrical gymnastics. This is simple, bass heavy, crunk music. It's effective in it's purpose, but it's totally generic (the recipe for most party songs). And some of these songs are just flat out horrible. "Stop Callin' Me" isn't only horrible, but it isn't about anything if you're paying attention to the wack lyrics DFB put on it (and whoever wrote the hook should be slapped). And who's idea was it to let Dame Dash (yeah, THAT Dame Dash) scream all over a song (Bricks 4 The High)? I want to know who the guy was that said "yeah, that's a good idea". Dame is doing what he does best, so he's not at fault.....I blame the idiot that put him on the song. "Suckas Come And Try Me" is probably the worst song to come out of the south since Drama dropped his album. And if you ask me, the "White Tee" remix was a step backward from the original. It would help if they could talk about something other than "haters", postin' up on the block (I swear they say that on the album at least 100 times), rims, jewelry, and weed. But expecting them to change up their sound would be silly on my part I guess. Besides, if people buy this, why should they change? That's another story though. In short, the album fails to seperate DFB from the pack. The beats are generic and the rhymes are terrible ("I'll make you 1 2 step like Ciara"? Come on, I could write that in my sleep) And it's hard to tell if there are four rappers or just one because they all sound similar. Once you understand the purpose of this album though, then you can find a few decent tracks, but don't go getting your hopes up just yet. There are only 3 or 4 songs worth hearing. "My Music" is listenable and DFBs put down some decent lyrics that are helped out by Bun B's good appearance. The best beats on the album are on "Don't Play With Me" feat. Three Six Mafia and "Freaky As She Wanna Be". "Don't Play With Me" features production from DJ Paul  Juicy J, so you know it's tight. I love Three Six, so that's my favorite song on the album. And "Freaky As She Wanna Be" will be the second single off the album if they're smart. On Top Of Our Game is good for what it's supposed to be good for (partying and....well, that's it), but not much else. Jermaine Dupri is trying his best to keep his label relevant, but I don't know if this approach is gonna help him any. This album is better than their debut, but that's not really saying much. This should be pretty obvious, but I'll say it anyway. If you're into lyrics, then this isn't for you. If you want crunk beats to bounce to, then this is right up your alley. It depends on your preference, but this listener has heard better crunk music and recommends passing on this one. Standout Tracks: Freaky As She Wanna Be, I Think They Like Me (Remix) feat. JD, Da Brat,  Bow Wow, Don't Play Wit Me feat. Three Six Mafia (My Favorite), and My Music feat. Bun B.
I'm surprised this show got past Season 1. Honestly, more talent can be found in my local karaoke bar. This show does NOT discover talent, they produce and market it. It is really demeaning to musicians everywhere. The judges are a joke, I guess the producers tell them what to say. Simon "the jerk" Cowell tries hard to be rude to everyone, hey...he has made a living out of it. Randy Jackson's vocab is limited to "yo", "yeah" and "dawg". Paula, who's the only one who I think deserves to even comment on the singers..unfortunately praises everyone, be it for their performance/energy/character/looks/(fill with any word of your choice). All in all, a total disaster...only in shows this sh*tty, can no-talents like William Hung be hailed as a celebrity. I am shocked people other than the families of those participating would actually spend time and money voting for these posers. On a more positive note, it's good that people don't actually buy the albums, thus resulting in total disappearing acts from Idol winners like Ruben and Fantasia...now we just need the American public to stop tuning in to the shows. Well, hope is all we have, right
It is hard to imagine what the American songbook ever did to Rod Stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this, not once, not twice, but three times.  Stewart's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with Napoleon's decision to invade Russia during the winter, it is staggeringly ill conceived.The problem, of course, is his voice.  The selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer, which are countless.  For starters, he has almost no range at all.  Next, his raspiness has no inherent beauty, and these are songs intended for beautiful voices.  By their very nature, the selections are vehicles for skilled singers, their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective.  Stewart, because he is a rock and blues singer, never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature, expressive voice.  He scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes.Banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations, (Dolly Parton!), do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project.  Bear in mind that I like Rod Stewart; he's from Scotland and he's the prototypical Brit blues belter.  If you want to know what he's actually good at, dig out your copy of Jeff Beck's first release, Truth.  Stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded.  But that's the problem.  On Truth it was the cigarettes, whisky, and swagger in his voice that made him great - it wasn't about singing technique - it was about authenticity.  Here, the focus is on singing, and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted.  Albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales, nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits.  To be avoided at all cost. 
I purchased this album because I am a fan of the Last Poets.  Upon listening to the samples provided by Amazon.com, I thought I was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the Last Poets: some great politically charged poetry, perhaps accompanied by some funky beats.  However, when I listened to the whole CD, I was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like "Get Out of the Ghetto Blues."  If more of the tracks had the sound of the title track, this would be a five-star album, in my opinion.  True, Scott-Heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album, but not in the form I had hoped for.  I would take the Last Poets' album "This Is Madness" over this particular Scott-Heron album
Even as dedicated of a Radiohead fan as I am, I really don't care much for this album. I say thank goodness for "Creep" because we may have never heard from them again (or at least not in the same way) if that song had not become as popular as it did
Boo-Wop? haha ok, anyways I bought his through Middle-Piller distro. and it's got a couple of o.k. songs on it. The problem is the singing and the overall production. This is definetely a home-recording on computer deal. The vocals are waaaaay weak. What exactly is a "re-worked" debut album??? I thought once an album was out it was done, set in stone? Apparently not,so mister monster gets to pull a Blitzkid (who changed their first album cover years after it came out!) and take the cheezy way out. A definete step up from bands like Blitzkid,but still in the cellar of rock n roll. Do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years
I really liked this when it came ut on vinyl, but in retrospect, it was the cause, not the music. B. Raitt is grand, G Nash with an excellant Cathedral, J C Young, and the highlight to me We Almost Lost Detroit by the great Gil Scott-Heron. But the second disc is second rate. Edit the filler and it rates higher
Generally harmless, except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents.  The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults.  But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old.  I wouldn't bring this CD into your house
The Movie was bad and unreal and so was the soundtrack, spend your money elsewher
I cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub-par Testament release.  Testament must have taken hints from Metallica and tried to attract a different audience.  This is not a horrible album, but compared to any other Testament album, it is easily their worst.  Only the die-hard Testament fan, or those into commercial metal should pick this up.  
Their new stuff is even worse. But this is still sexist, boring, annoying music at its worst. There are much better artists out there, so why listen to these two untalented rappers

I'm mean, I know these guys don't have a shred of originality.. Afterall, that make some of the same crappy beats you can put together on piano's and they just got to mess up classic songs also.He's about as good of a musician as he is an actor.This country is just too unoriginal these days
Anyone who rates this more than one star has mental deficiencies.Seriously
The music of Dowland is wonderful - but Sting isn't up to interpreting it. You can't even distinguish the words half the time, just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he doesn't possess the skills to carry it off. This music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language...Sting, for all his merits, hasn't got that in his repertoire yet. It's an exercise in pretention, laughable at times. The letter reading is ridiculous. I love both Sting's voice and Dowland's song, but this CD is a failure.
I can't believe I just spent over an hour of my life listening to ten (TEN!!) different mixes of this not too remarkable dance hit. By the third version, my brain turned to jelly. By the fifth, I needed a drink. By the final re-mixed version, my hangover already started to set in. This e.p. is for DJ's and masochists only.			- Tom Rya
Great cd. Imus in the morning recommended highly and the I-man was not wrong. One of the best cd's I've owned in years. I listen to a lot of Buffett, James Taylor, Delbert McClinton, and this cd places high in these ranks
After souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're probably better served by checking out their first four albums (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers
Metallica never recovered from the death of Cliff Burton, as this album is prime evidence of.  He helped to bring depth to the songs that is not present here.  Also, Newstead only gets one song on this album, which is ironically the best song on the album.  In the history of Metallica, this album marks the transition from artistic song writing to commercial
I received emails about delaying my order three times. Since it showed that the product was available, I didn't understand why I had to wait less than two months to get my order. I was so disappointed by the Amazon this time! Doing business like that, I am not sure how long you will survive
Hooba...stank...stinks and will always stink. I don't know about the rest of the CD, but listening to The Reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal.  I'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn. Egad
After hearing "I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)" I don't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this CD in its entirety. I'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this CD sucks. This CD is a waste and T-Pain is illiterate. There! I said it in one sentence. Holllaaa
Not exactly the "vaults" blowing open, as stated in the promo.  These are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s, when the group was on hiatus from serious recording.  That's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows, literary journals and graphic design firms.Whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected, such as "Reprehensible", "Rest Awhile" and "Certain People I Could Name".  But there are too few of these real songs, and they'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career
Unfortunately, I forked out $14 for this CD.  Upon first listen I am extremely dissapointed.  Being a huge fan of SP for years this album offers none of the harmonic resonance of Green's previous work.  Also gone are the magnificant beats we have come to expect from this artist.  Use this as Sunday background music on a rainy day; but do not expect to get the party started with this album...
Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all ("Bandages" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede). If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't.And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre.
I love his voice, but the arrangements are way too complex and stilted.  There are about 12 key changes in every song.  The melodies are buried so far beneath his reinterpretations that one can barely recognize the songs. I feel these affectations detract from the songs.  While his vocal gymnastics are very impressive, the result just isn't enjoyable to listen to (unless you are a voice student or professional singer)
that this great music sounds so awful on this CD.I wanted an introduction to Kate Bush's music, and this CD seemed a very good way to start.  When I put it on, I couldn't believe how muffled and dull it sounded.  I could swear I'm listening to the music through a wall of cotton.I went to the existing reviews here on Amazon, and, sure enough, Ferrara Brain Pan's spot-on review stated exactly what I was feeling upon listening to these recordings.It is inexcusable that an artist of Bush's stature is represented in such poor technical fashion - and a shame, considering how good the songs are.Another little beef is that the CD clocks in at under 49 minutes - in other words, there's room for 30 more minutes of music, which I'm certain could have been well-used, considering the vastness of her catalogue.I will be looking for the remastered individual albums, but if I didn't know how good Kate Bush was outside of the context provided by this butchered collection, I wouldn't bother buying any more of her material.Shame on EMI for allowing this.  I give it two stars (instead of one) simply because the music is so very good
I liked the Santana - Steven Tyler song/video. Since I found out about the sneaky root kit this software installs and the idea of no free use of something I buy within reasonable means - I wont buy the CD.Want to make sure that Sony loses money in this effort - will teach them a lesson. I have been burned by Sony's proprietary [...] before on other items, so I will stay away.
This CD is 100% pure junk! The CD is sung by KIDS! They have high-pitched voices that aren't even good enough to win the school talent show. The other singers are ADULTS who have voices that aren't anything impressive, either. If the songs were sung by the original singer it would of been better. Stop this s****y music!
I got the cd with only disc 2...it was unopened and had 2 copies of disc two it was rediculus...im happy onme of my friends could make me a copy of the first one...
Do not buy this cd, the first two reviews said this is a good cd. NOPE. I'll tell ya the real about this cd. I believe this was 305's first cd, and I don't see how this cd was ever in mass production. While It does have a few decent cuts most of this cd belongs to a different artist. 305 got much of the material for this cd on Techmaster P.E.B's masterpiece Bass Computer. Any one who has both cd's can tell. If your looking for bass, you'll find it here. But you can find knock with any bass artist. I give this cd one star for biting Techmaster
Maybe its just me but the piano is out of tune badly enough that it should not have been recorded. I had to force myself to finish listening to the concerto and did not even bother with the rest. Sad piece of work
Trash, and irrated plus the good albums ya'll give them 0's.so now I'ma let the world know
although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album "musicology" instead
FLCL is THE WORST anime of all time, and possibly the worst thing to come out of Japan since the Pearl Harbor attacks, and the soundtrack is just as bad, if not worse.  Its nothing more than J-pop mixed with bad Japanese rock.  Bad guitar playing, boring drum beats, and inaudible bass; you've heard one Pillows song, you've heard them all.  Only "otakus" with no life love this s*** (like Matthew G. Salisbury).If you want good Japanese music, go for King's Evil.PS, that album cover is possibly the worst ever made
Just listening to the samples of this new remix of "GOLD:35th Anniversary Edition ~ The Carpenters" I found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly. Certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent Of Karen Carpenter and Richard as well. I wonder what Richard was thinking when he remixed these songs? As another review noticed and I agree with, is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of Karen's deep resounding truly perfect voice. This is not a CD you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of The Carpenters. The older CDs (if still in production or if you can find them used) "Carpenters Classics 25th Anniversary" a 2 CD disc 98:04 minute Collection remastered digitally, is a much better pick. Especially for those who remember The Carpenters when Karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with. The other CD's worth finding of The Carpendters especially if you like the Talent of Karen's deep resounding perfect voice, would be The CD "Voice Of The Heart" This is a hautingly beautiful collection of Love songs by Karen who lets each song touch your Heart and Soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song. The other one I would highly recommend, if Christmas is your Holiday, would be "Carpenters Christmas Portrait"... "Special Edition digital version....Celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the Seasons best..." with Karen and Richard. There are 34 Carpenters songs as timeless as their sound,and 11 performances heard on this Holiday CD for the first time. These CDs are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard Karen sing. These are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and Richard. This new remix maybe OK if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs The Carpenter's recorded and later remastered-Not Remixed- sounded. For this reason I give this 35th Anniversary remix a 2 star rating. These older CDs are how The Carpenders really won over their fans, took the Music Industry by storm and gave a generation of Music lovers reason to Love The Carpenders music and the sound they gave each song. Talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only The Carpenters could deliver. As I more or less said in my Title for this review and taken from an old saying "if it ain't broke don't fix it!" or in this case Don't Remix it!
I just want to slap who ever keeps coming out with these.HARD.Okay,there are some song that deserve this.To be ruined by off key 10-year-olds with annoying high squeaky voices.But come ON!They KILLED 'My Immortal'!That is a beautiful song!I'm listning to it as I write this!And also,little 6-year-olds cannot properly appreciate it!And,let's face it,'My Immortal' is not exactly a kiddie song.I mean,do you want your little 4-year-old boy listning to 'Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams,Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me,These wounds won't seem to heal,This pain is just too real,There's just too much that time cannot erase'?Please,STOP BUYING THIS CRAP!Not only do they ruin the great songs of our generation,but they also put on some really innapropriate songs.I mean,come ON!Go look up the lyrics to 'Toxic'!That is DEFINATLY not a good song for little children.Of corse,the only reason any child would like this is because their older sibling listens to it.Then someone should sit them down and explain why this is NOT for them.Die Kidz Bop
I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.  Don't waste you money on this one.  Get the "Mr. Show" DVDs instead and forget this ever existed.   
Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel' Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive, massive  disappointment.Quite simply the material on 'Getting Somewhere' is weak and gutless. On the rare occasions Moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on Hallelujah  New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time around.If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man for the job.Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately
When it comes to Big Star's 70's output, you can call me a HOPELESS FANBOY, because after listening to In Space, it seems that ONLY a hopeless fanboy would think that thirty-some-years later, exactly one-half of the classic Big Star lineup could---or in forever difficult Alex Chilton's case, WOULD be so inclined---to attempt to recapture the lightning-in-a-bottle transcedent pop magic that made those 70s discs so great.  This disc has WAY MORE in common with Chilton's oft-times difficult, mostly self-indulgent solo work than with any of Big Star's previous fascinating pop near-perfection. While I'll admit that I have enjoyed a good chunk of Chilton's solo work, (in a slightly guilty, rolling-my-eyes, "Oh...that Alex!" sorta way...) my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by the fact that THIS group and that THIS particular collection of songs are presented as "Big Star."  In Space is connected musically to the original Big Star by little more than the fact that two of the same guys in THIS BAND were in THAT BAND.  If you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed.    
This album is way overated, let me tell you why.Wack MC:MF Doom is a bad rapper, not the worst, just bad. He can flow but his rymes are weak, corny, and somtimes it doesnt make sense at all. The corniest ryme I heard was- "We rock the house like rock 'n roll/ got more soul Than a sock with a hole." LMAO! It gets worse "Take it from the Tec-9 holder/ They bit and dont know they neck shine from shinola" What is he talking about??? He is not a genius MC, Nas is, he is even worse than Aesop Rock. Which they rap with words and dont even make any sense.Filler:This Cd has too much filler, they have like 10 songs that last only 50 secs. Some of them is not even neccasary.Average Beats:The beats are either average or just sucks. I can make better beats on Fruity Loops. However Track 22 "Rhinestone Cowboy" had the best beat on the entire album. The beat was hot to tell you the truth, but that only gives it one star.Overall this album sucks, just download "Rhinestone Cowboy" and call it a day. I think Madlib can make good beats its just that he didnt show it here. I dont recommend this album, if you want a good album get Mos Def "Black on Both Sides" It 10x better than this
Do you know why this double CD is often in the bargain basement?  SImply because it is an inferior product.  For some very odd reason, the compiler at the record company decided to put 13 live songs instead of the studio versions that we all remember.  For all we know, it may have been a copyright problem. I bought this for my Dad about 5 years ago, but we were both unaware of the live recordings until we played it. The live recordings on this CD are dismal and not related to the awesome "Hot August Night". Fortunately for me,  I own the right Neil Diamond CD's which contain the studio versions.  These are still available . The first is called "12 Greatest Hits" (A black and white photo a young Neil), and the second is called "12 Greatest Hits Volume 2" (a colour photo of Neil sitting on a sofa).  Both of these contain all the studio versions - and not one live recording in sight!!!  Just released is a new compilation called Neil Diamond GOLD, as part of the GOLD series but I do not know if it too contains the dreadful live recordings. All I know is that it is missing a lot of key tracks
..of little teenage white girls trying to sound like thirty-year-old black women.  First it was Britney Spears, then it was Christina Aguilera, now it's Joss Stone.  The former at least have something going for them; Britney's first album had catchy beats, and even though Aguilera's style is incredibly trashy, she does have enormous vocal power and range if she would only stop trying so hard.Try as I might, though, I just don't understand the appeal of Joss Stone.  I didn't buy this album; a friend of mine likes it and I've had to listen to it enough times to want to rip my ears right out of my head.  I don't see what is fresh or original about ripping off Janis Joplin and the generally much more talented black soul singers.  Maybe it's the Rick Astley effect: you don't expect THAT voice coming out of THAT face.  You don't expect a squinty little teenaged blonde to growl and screech like a deranged cat.  But that effect can only take you so far, as Rick Astley himself found out. This album is not only an unpleasant listening experience because of the stupid songs ("Dirty Man" basically just repeats "You're a dirty man..." with very minor variations, along with a great deal of unnecessary caterwauling) and the nails-down-a-chalkboard voice of Stone herself - it's a depressing reminder of how low our culture has sunk, when it can't come up with any culture based on its own heritage but slavishly copycats things from another culture that seems more "cool".  Stone, like Aguilera and Spears, tries to sing like an older black woman, a woman with soul - an Aretha Franklin or a Gloria Gaynor.  But Stone et al. sound like little girls clattering around in grown-up shoes.  They haven't been alive long enough to live similar experiences of the women they are trying to imitate.  Their singing rings hollow to me, show-offy and fake.Stone could rival Aguilera in shameless and unnecessary vocal theatrics, though she has nowhere near Aguilera's sweetness or range.  Her voice might be described as "smoky" by some; to me it sounds gravelly, sandpapery, and as pleasant as scraping your knees on asphalt. I don't understand why anyone in the right mind would willingly put themselves through the ordeal of listening to this CD, much less enjoy it.  I guess fake is good enough for some people.  It makes me chuckle, though, to hear people rave about her voice as "authentic".   If you're looking for soul, try Macy Gray.  She's for real.  Try the hugely talented but woefully ignored Tasmin Archer and Karen Rodriguez.  Those are fresh, authentic voices that will make you realize what a load of bollocks Joss Stone and her ilk truly are.The only white woman I have ever heard who could sing like she was black was Linda Ronstadt.  Go back and listen to a Ronstadt classic like "Hurts So Bad" and compare it to this modern-day drivel.  Ronstadt sang with real feeling, real knowledge, real pain - worlds apart from this fake plastic imitation of soul that seems to be the rule and not the exception these days.  I gave this one star because there is no zero-stars option.  Joss Stone is just a musical Chav, an unconvincing shoplifter of another, better culture
I WOULDN'T KNOW I NEVER GOT MY CD AND ITS BEEN OVER TWO MONTH
I admit to being curious about Rihanna's music because like a previous poster from Brooklyn stated " I was not trying to become a Rihanna fan!!".  I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of this disc and although Rihanna is no vocal powerhouse, the songs on the disc were produced in such a way as to mask this fact and create more than a few enjoyable songs.I really loved her lead single, PON DE REPLAY and since I don't listen to the radio, it never grew old to me because I heard it so infrequently. It's almost an instantly classic dance track with its hypnotic beats  fun lyrics.The other standout tracks to me are:HERE I GO AGAIN - like the island beats of the music and again, her vocals are utilized well on the trackWILLING TO WAIT - more of a straight r track with great beats that again, work well with her vocalsLET ME - has an interesting "go-go" beat mixed with a middle eastern soundRUSH - again, a great dance trackIt's unfortunate that her vocal skills are so slight because there are 2 ballads that although featuring very pretty music production, ultimately fail as singles because she is such a weak vocalist: THE LAST TIME - Rihanna attempts vocal runs that are way out of her league and NOW I KNOW - although she has moments where her voice sounds pretty, this song would've been a big hit for a stronger singer.Honestly, I'd recommend this disc to others who are curious about Rihanna's music and to those who like Ashanti - ultimately they are cut from the same cloth as "artists".  They are able to produce enjoyable singles (through the magic of ProTools) but don't do much in the way of live vocal performances
This is nothing like the classic dead you've heard about.  Far from it.  The sound is too polished.  Alabama Get Away and Althea are okay but the rest is junk.  I think most dead heads would agree that this is not the one to look for if you just want some of the Deads' best music.  Really... The Grateful Dead with a polished sound??  Just doesn't seem to fit.  Save your money for one of their greatest hits compilations,plus American Beauty, Worjing Man's Dead, Europe '72 and Dead Set
Sorry, Bill!Poor lyrics and only fair production have made this a most disappointing purchase.  The guitar playing is adequate, but not good enough to save this material.  I hope Bill spends a little more time on the thought process before bringing out his next material.
First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicable This CD is not worth having....the only track that stands out for me is SUPERSTAR and I think COMMON is amazing
I bought this album because I loved the title song.  It's such a great song, how bad can the rest of the album be, right?  Well, the rest of the songs are just filler and aren't worth the money I paid for this. It's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe. Kenny Chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the Nashville music scene.  He's gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town.  I'll get down off my soapbox now.  But country music really needs to get back to it's roots and stop this pop nonsense.  What country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things.
I've been down for Monica since the beginning; but now I am FINISHED, I love Monica's voice, but whats up with all these singers wanting to be rappers...WTF!!! I want the soulfoul Monica from the first CD, "Sideline Ho" ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! again WTF!! Could someone please come out with a soulful mature CD, cause this one aint even close.
I got this CD after seeing what I remembered as a decent video on Fuse TV.  Maybe I was half-asleep, because after listening to this ho-hum entry into the world of emo copycats, I can't even remember or recognize which song it was.  This album is ultimately forgettable-- better off listening to any Jimmy Eat World CD again and again, which is actually an enjoyable experience
If you are looking for boring, lifeless adult contemporary music, then this CD is for you.  If you are looking for a great guitar CD, this isn't it.  I had such high hopes for this CD after the Robert Johnson CDs and the Cream reunion, but all winning streaks must come to an end, and Clapton's comes to a screeching halt with this.  Of all the Eric Clapton CDs that I like, this isn't one of them.  I'm glad Clapton is now in a happy place (and deservedly so), but this CD just doesn't do it for me
many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know. But to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds. This is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music. Another double ambient album - Seti - Pharos - is a real masterpiece.It is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning - but - you know - never judge the cover by its album. Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts.
Kate Bush's second album, "Lionheart", may be the weakest in her catalog.  Its clear Bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing "The Kick Inside Part Two", and instead reaches in a number of different directions, some successful, some less so.Musically, the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record ("In Search of Peter Pan", "In the Warm Room"), a more pop structure ("Wow"), rhythmic shifts ("Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake") an almost shuffle ("Fullhouse") and a gret rock song ("Hammer Horror").  Lyrically, Bush has added a level of sensuality to her work ("Symphony in Blue") and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects ("Kashka from Baghdad").The problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing "Kashka from Baghdad" can be all that bad, and certainly "Symphony in Blue" is strong enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't work for me.  For early Bush, try her debut ("The Kick Inside") or the stunning "Never For Ever"
The music on this album is performed so exquisitely; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating, that one is almost tempted to forget what a "What for?" musical this is. Donna Murphy plays the title character of Fosca, a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky. She lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome, virile Giorgio. Giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful, but vapid Clara, a married woman back home. However from the time Giorgio comes into Fosca's sphere, she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him. She shows up EVERYWHERE he happens to be; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity. To depict Fosca musically, Sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career. Everything is SO lugubrious, dark, portentous, tragic; punctuated by militaristic strains (with snare drums)because the soldiers like to...umm...march.  In the end, Giorgio is worn down enough by Fosca's attentions that he succumbs. He believes he has fallen in love with her, shortly after which she...dies.As I mentioned earlier, the material is beautifully performed (Marin Mazzie and Jere Shea render the opening "Happiness" with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality. Donna Murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting "Loving You."), but you come away wondering what the point of it all is. If Sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease, then he succeeds admirably
I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back
I should first state that I am a huge EJ fan. His music has been extremely important to me over the years. He is, without a doubt, a genius ... I would go so far as to call him the Mozart of our times.But, Elton can also write bloated, self-indulgent tripe, and if you ask me, this album belongs in that bucket. I give it 2 stars just because of SSMLT, one of his all-time greats. I never cease to be blown away by that song. But the rest of this album? Booooooring!!!
The second CD was scratched and hence I cannot play it. I would appreciate it if you would send me another one and also include the information needed to return the damaged one sent to me.Thanks.Jeann
Am I The only ones who actually liked nelly's first album, I Thought it had charm, style, grandier to me and kind of scale and kind of importance, you thought it mean something, but this is just a lame gimmick from the start, I Mean there are some moments and some good songs (including the sexy and very funny music video hot in herre with cedric the entertainer), but the rest are just horrible, there is nothing else about this album that I Can engage with nor cared about and who cares?Country Grammer was funny and good, this one's an utter disaster.One of the worst albums of the decade.
Nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst, and how dare him to diss KRS-one, he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on Number 1, he just added to why he sucks. Lets face it, all his songs are basically dumb and and really don,t have much texture involved. And how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable. If you buy this album, you throw away good money. Unless you like bubblegum rap. This is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool, but lets face it ,its played out
I first became a fan of the Gorillaz with their excellent 2nd CD, Demon Days. The interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so "out there" that when you first hear one of their CD's...it sounds like complete garbage. But once you listen again and again, you start to like it more and more. Eventually you end up really liking the CD. That was the case with Demon Days. After enjoying that CD fully, I thought I should check out the first Gorillaz CD, and  I didn't like it all that much. There just seems to be very little actual songs on the CD. Way too much of it sounds like complete filler. There were a couple throwaway songs on Demon Days, but most of the stuff on that CD was great. Here, we've got songs that are just...boring. Nothing happens. I was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs, but it never happens. You just listen to 2-D whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background. (Such as on songs like New Genious, Man Research, and Starshine.) Some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all, sometimes sounding just like static noise. Songs like this, such as Double Bass, are cool for a minute or two, but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes. It gets boring. Other songs, like 5/4, M1 A1, and Rock the House are catchy at first, but just don't have staying power. They get old. 5/4 got annoying quickly, M1 A1 and Punk lost their appeal quickly, and Rock the House is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it. And songs like Latin Simone are just annoying. The remixes of 19-2000 and Clint Eastwood that end the CD are also fairly forgettable, although 19-2000's kind of catchy on the first couple listens. There are some good songs here, though. Tomorrow Comes Today, Clint Eastwood, Gravity, 19-2000, and Left Hand Suzuki Method are cool songs. Slow Country's kind of cool, too. And Dracula's got an awesome, almost haunting sound to it, and it's really absorbing. Although it too, unfortuantely, loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it. This small collection of good songs, though, is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks. Much of this CD just isn't really that good.I don't know...this CD just seemed empty. Very few meaningful tracks, lots of filler, and some really annoying and repetitive songs. Some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long, mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs. Clocking in at 72 minutes, (which makes it 22 minutes(!)longer than Demon Days) this CD was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff. People interested in The Gorillaz should pick up their superior follow-up, Demon Days, instead of this one. If I listened to this debut CD first, I probably wouldn't have ended up liking this band very much. The good news about this is that the Gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump; their CDs are getting better, not worse. That is a great sign for the future of this awesome band.
Understand, I love Springsteen.  Born to Run is my second favorite album of all time.  I have seen him live over a dozen times.  I personally think he is the single most important American rock and roll artist ever (with apologies to Elvis, Chuck Berry and Dylan).  I even loved Nebraska, so don't tell me it's an E-Street band thing or a rock versus folk thing, but this album is unlistenable.  Some reviewers have called it beautiful and powerful.  That's rubbish.  There is a complete absence of melody on this record, as was the case with much of The Ghost of Tom Joad album (with a huge exception being "Youngstown" - a great song).  The apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like Woody Guthrie or Jimmy Rodgers is just frightening.  Dylan could pull it off, Bruce just disappoints.  But it's the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody that makes this record a failure.  Believe, I listened to Devil  Dust 10-15 times in hopes of finding what I am apparently missing.  I couldn't. I thought The Rising was a nice album.  I even liked the Devils  Dust solo tour (Bruce is a powerful performer, and maybe even more commading when it's just him on stage), but I doubt this CD will ever find its way back into the player
look i really despise bush. he's an idiot. and i know people are gonna have different opinions on that. but what i wish wouldnt happen is people giving this 5 stars cause its against bush and they agree. seriously the music is really not good. however if you do buy it make sure you watch the DVD eh? its got a great will farrel skit on it. 2 stars for that and the few decent songs on here (ie no w by the ministry) thats all
Bob James - the mastermind of smooth Jazz. "H", "Touchdown", "Grand Piano Cannyon". Eternal pieces of Art. Brave and thoughtful new directions in Jazz. We owe him a lot.But the recent releases of Fourplay -including "X" - don't meet my expectations at all: predictable, repetitive, overproduced Computer-music.The typical Fourplay sound squeezed out like a lemon in another CD. Larrys guitar playing takes a nice direction on "Tournabout" - but then the song falls back again to old routine. "Screenplay" is a good one (one of two songs that were done by Bob). The rest, hmm... some nice solos constricted in predictabiltiy.Don't get me wrong, I like all of the guys. Every single member of the group has done great things in the past. So - a bit more breveness,  Yes Please
It is bad! As much  as I like "10 new songs", this one disappointed me a lot.
Kate Moss?  That gawddamn rollerskate song?  Oh, no.  The spoken tracks are equally repelling.  There is really no atmosphere to this album
This album is lame as hell but next to the air pollution on the airwaves today, this aint too bad thats why it gets a 2. Right before female rappers(there's a few exceptions), I hate all little kid rappers. Even when I was a kid. I don't like anything on this album, I still got the tape and it hasn't "krossed" my mind to even cop the cd. If you like this kind of stuff, or you loved "jump" back in the day then I guess this is for you
I was very excited to hear that this new Muppets Holiday offering was coming!  The previous two Christmas albums ("A Christmas Together" w/ John Denver  "A Muppet Christmas Carol") have long been family favorites at hour house in December.  However, this time I am disappointed.Most of the songs performed on this cd include voices not done by the original puppeteers that made them famous.  I realize it is impossible to perfectly duplicate the voices to match the puppeteers that are no longer with us.  But, to focus on these voices so much (Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Statler  Waldorf, The Swedish Chef) in this album, only produces a disappointing reminder that the "Muppets" we grew up with are long gone.Maybe I am being a little hard on this cd.  But, there are plenty of Muppets they could have focused on for this project that are still performed in the original voices (Robin, Sam, Honeydew  Beaker, Rizzo, Louzeland, etc).  Those voices added to those of Ganzo, Miss Piggy and Fozzie would have made for a more familiar feel.There are a couple of good cuts on the album.  One is "Merry Christmas" by Pepe.  The other is "Santa Baby" by Miss Piggy.Sadly, over all I can not recommend this cd.
Another torrent of mild tripe from everyone's "favourite" DJ, Tiesto.  What on earth is he going to do when the supply of inane, pastel-coloured eurovomit dance music runs out?When I think about the number of times I've heard him touted as "World's Number One Best Voted DJ" or "DJ Mag Top 100 Finalist", you'd start to think that the man can actually mix records, when in fact rather than mix them, he tends to grind them together roughly into a nightmarish aural paste then reconfigure them violently in new, unusual and horrendously nauseating forms.  I can absolutely confirm this. I have had the startling and displeasing experience of witnessing it live.  The sad truth of the matter is, that there are any number of drug-addicted fluoro-pants-wearing 16 year old ravers out there, and all are quite willing to buy boring rubbish like this.  Or at least all are prepared to ask their mum and dad to buy it for them for xmas.I sign off in disgust
Don't get me wrong with the 2 stars some songs here are really good.TrafficURAdagio For StringsNyanaThose songs are just great and the best off the album.But songs likeWalking On CloudsSweet MiseryLove Comes AgainForever Todaycan only be enjoyed so little times but they are good though.  No song here is annoying in the beginning and I see a lot of 5 stars and either they are just suckers for Dj Tiesto or they wrote the review as soon as they got it.  Cause after months of having this you will see yourself skipping to songs just to hear the good stuff.Dj Tiesto shows he does a good job working with vocals but for a number 1 Dj I expect to be hearing his stuff for a long time before getting annoyingVerdict: 2.8 out of 5.0 Not bad for the first 20 listens but damn I could have enjoyed it much more
Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll.  His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, Reptile, makes adult contemporary sound exciting.  A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with Backless, Another Ticket, and Money  Cigarrettes all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album.  The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow.  This is easy listening for classic rock fans
The only thing you can say about today's music is that it's disguisting, gross, and made by recording artists who drop out of school and seem to think that a life as a rap music artists is so cool, until they get shot.  Every copy of this CD should be burned
I got this album because Obie Trice did some great stuff on the 8 Mile soundtrack, so I figured I'd check out what else he'd done.  This album just doesn't live up to that. 
This is anything but soothing. The tone is too high pitched; nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky Carmel coastline that I was hoping for. I did buy the twofer and got the Ocean Surf CD by Dan Gibson and found it much more relaxing, even though it isn't a tumbling surf sound. I was able to fall asleep... which was my goal. Now if I could only return Ocean Waves.
Shannon Lawson is capable of a much better album.  I saw him down in Nashville when he was with the Galoots, and it was amazing!  If they were to put out a CD I'm sure it would be one of my favorites.  Shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that's what Nashville should have let him do on his first solo CD.  Instead they gave it this generic, overproduced sound, leaving Shannon sound like everyone else.  With the way bluegrass is selling these days, it's a shame that Shannon couldn't showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena..
I was a huge fan of the jam , but Ive grown to despise Paul Weller and this CD strengthens my view. This is a covers cd and hasn't got a patch on albums like all mod cons or sound affects.With paul weller everything is about a  quick buck and ripping off a loyal fan base , with over a dozen jam compilations ,rarities, box sets and dvd's in the last few years.[since he bought the exclussive rights to all the jam recordings from the rest of the band].This album is bland  so give it a miss and spend your money on the new stiff little fingers cd which features bruce foxto
As a fan of Pete Seeger's music, I bought this CD in the hope that the family connection would ensure similar quality of the music.  Disappointingly, I've found this album really grates on me after a couple of songs.  Peggy's vocal style in particular becomes mighty annoying to listen to over the length of the album, as her delivery can best be described as a neo-hillbilly twang.  I may end up combining the best half-dozen songs from this album with some other folk albums to generate a listenable best-of set, but I'd find it unthinkable to listen to this entire set in one sitting.  Only devoted fans of the genre or the duo should invest in this set; more casual fans of folk should direct their dollars to any of Pete's fine albums such as the Carnegie Hall classic
[First of all: I only gave this one star because the rating doesn't let you go any lower] I only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it, leaving me to pick it up. I proceeded to suffer through it so I could give you fair warning. If you buy this, consider yourself warned
There is now no trace of delight left in this band. All songs are either moderately slow and somewhat self-indulgent or frightfully slow and quite self-indulgent. I do love this band and pronounce praises upon them whenever I receive a doe-eyed look saying their name, but this CD and the CD previous (which did have 1 tune, "Apples," with which one could smile) does, for the first time, take away any anticipation for their next collection of chopfallen tunes.First, we loose the Roses, then the Ned's disband, following that, Swervedriver breaks apart and Velocity Girl is gone forevermore. Now my Charlatans have become charlatans of the great band they once were.
Okay, I used to think that Nelly was a fun guy to listen to. He made songs that I used to enjoy, such as St. Louis, E.I., Country Grammar, and Ride Wit Me off of the CD "Country Grammar". Then there were a good amount of other good songs on "Nellyville". And the good thing about these CDs was that there were not too many skip tracks. But with Nellyville, Nelly brought us the obnoxious Hot In Herre, a single that got plenty of radio playtime, but I could not stand. This was not a good sign for the future. Then comes these two new CDs, Sweat and Suit. I have not listened to most of Suit, but I have listened to most of this, and it is pure garbage. This is the same Nelly who made Hot In Herre for sure. It has a bunch of catchy songs that live off the beats and the hook to drive them to get radio playtime. Most of the tracks are much worse than Hot In Herre, if that is believable. I just want a decent CD from Nelly, I am not expecting a classic. Instead he drops the definition of materialistic garbage, and I shake my head in disgust. Avoid this one and get one of his older CDs, or a CD from a better artist
I find it utterly disturbing how simple it is for a talented D.J. to round up 3 bafoons and exploit their childish and idiotic personalites all for their dirty dollar; Ripping off the kids droned and purged on the MTV feedbag, and this man Paul Wall probably gets under my skin more then any of them.Notice his rhymes don't descend any futher than his mouth, his car and his money. What excactly does that say to me about my life or the world around me? Does it reach artistic heights? Or is it just another jackass looking for his 15 minutes of fame?And still people eat it up like Chicken N Dumplin's on a cold winter's dayThis is excactly whats very wrong with today's hip hop, it's all capitalizing on mindless club music artistic talent is down the toilet infinitelyStay away from this awful garbagedon't let MTV rob another cen
Mostly bland, by this time it seemed that BAD was dead in the water, nothing here matches the excitement of THIS IS. Especially annoying are `Sightsee MC!', `Ice Cool Killer' and `The Big V'. BAD goes rap? No thanks. It's easy to see why they did the whole BAD 2 thing. Buy THE GLOBE instead
This album is pure crap! Just a marketing move to capitalize on the sales from Straight Outta Cashville, until he can make a real new album, not this microwaved crapola. If you like Buck, get Straight Outta Cashville, an Beg For Mercy, than wait for his future release, with actual new tracks. I strongly advise you not to buy this. It is a total rip off. I wasted my time Downloading this
I can't believe the other people giving this high marks. I love the wheel, but darn if this isn't just terrible. There isn't even a single on it; I can't believe the studio released it. Thank god I got a promotional copy and didn't have to go buy it in the store. The Catherine Wheel needs to get back together--quick
With much anticipation we awaited the arrival of Clay's second album, thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers... and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career.  While Clay's voice still sounds great, the CD is an entire collection of uninspired, underproduced remakes ... not one of which goes beyond the original.  As you can see, this CD is nowhere on the billboard charts, and we're very sad to say in our household, that it's for good reason.  Save your money and buy one of the much better Idol CDs ... and almost any of them are, most recently Kelly Pickler and Carrie Underwood.
Thankfully I checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it.  I felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it.  I made it through the CD once with my kids, but that was it.  We will not be listening again.  As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews).  The singers (kids AND adults!)on KidzBob are out of tune and just painful to listen to.   
God, I can't believe this guy. Ja Rule was never a gangsta in his life, he can't talk gangsta. And stop trying to be like Tupac, Tupac actually was a gangsta. Your a fake and if he was still alive he would not only not role with you but diss you so badly you'd wet your pants. This guy should be booted out of the game, not only his he lying when he talks all this gangsta s*** as if he went through it, his ruining hip hop. Yeah and Ja, stop dissing Eminem and 50. You know perfectly well that they'd kill you in a battle anyday. Ja Rule has always been s***. Go listen to real rap
Who the **ck are GNR?? Plus they make awful music! I can't stand this annyoing album. The music is awful, so as the lyrics. There is not ONE good song on this piece of s**t. It is a album that contains 12 crappy songs. AXL ROSE is a very annoying lead singer just screams and sings horribly, and SLASH is terrible too. In THE WAY STAY AWAY FROM THIS AS WELL AS GNRS OTHER ALBUMS. LEAVE GNR ALONE....GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS.I recommend buy these albums insted.FOREIGNER 4LOVE OVER GOLD-DIRE STRAITSON EVERY STREET-DIRE STRAITSCOMBAT ROCK-THE CLASHHOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB-U2AMERICAN IDIOT-GREEN DAYANIMAL MAGNETISM-SCORPIONSLOAD-METALLICARELOAD-METALLICAAND JUSTICE FOR ALL-METALLICAMASTER OF PUPPETS-METALLICARIDE THE LIGHTNING-METALLICASELF TITLE BLACK ALBUM-METALLICAPAST MASTERS VOL 2-BEATLESPHYSICAL GRAFFITI-LED ZEPPELINSOME GIRLS-THE ROLLING STONESGREATEST HITS-NEIL YOUNGTHE LAST DJ-TOM PETTY-GNR ARE AS BAD AS PINK FLOYD, PEARL JAM, NIRVANA, and AC/DC.

I am a 23 yr old mother of a 2 1/2 yr old. Not only are these children HORRIBLE singers, but there is a reason that most parents don't let their children listen to the original songs... they teach them things they don't need to know.   I thought this would be a "kids" version that would get rid of that stuff when I let a child I was babysitting put the cd on... and was appalled at how much they talked about sex and other innappropriate things for children.  They didn't take that out!  Children are exposed to that every day in our world now, telling them it is "normal" and "ok".  Parents have a big enough job to teach their children right and wrong with the way the world is today.  It becomes a much harder job when you give them something that is for "kids" that teaches them that those things are "normal".  They assume if it is ok for a kids cd, it can't be that bad.  I think this is horrible and would never spend a penny on it for a child!  Some of the songs I like in the originial version and do listen to, and this CD has ruined them!  But when it comes to children who are too young to understand that it is just a song and doesn't mean what they say is ok... I think it is the WORST thing you could buy for your child
I understand why the Beatles are the top sellers in rock music as they suck. They only made about two decent songs in their "Hey Jude" a pretty song, and "Ballad Of John And Yoko". The sixties was a horrible decade of rock music. I would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in the sixties, which one of them is Neil Young's "Down By The River".I have listened to the Beatles for about a month and thought how lame and pathetic their music was. They were hugely one of the most overrated bands of all time. This ONE album is definately not the album to buy at ALL unless you are a sick moron who does not have a good taste in music.Here you will get 25 of the worst songs ever recorded. If you want good music, I recommend go buy albums from Foreigner, Dire Straits, Green Day, Guns N' Roses, and Metallica insted. Don't buy this album at most costs as you will waste money on 25 awful songs
I remember listening to this years ago, and I thought I would add this to my cd library, now I know why it has been years sense I've listened to it,, very sqeaky, dull, slow paced stuff, Bob Segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil..
I agree with other reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  I should have listened to the samples.  To hear more awful fakes, visit the  producer's web site at drewsfamous.com.  Listen to their selection of garbage before you make the purchase
This album is one of the best sonic youth album...I advise everyone to listen this album...Break the circle of common popular music...This album irritates your soul and freedback your dreams..
If you like early Priest, buy Genocide. It has both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!! How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it. These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why would they mess with that too? Do youself a favor and buy either Genocide, or if you like to have the original artwork, buy Rocka Rolla and Sad wings of Destiny seperately
I can't discard these songs completely, because they have such potential! Clever, fun lyrics, great beat, but BOY I wish this guy could hit his notes more often!I suppose this fellow requires the sort of "pitch doesn't matter" mindset that Grateful Dead listeners perfected years ago (or similar drugs). I'm just not that tolerant or substance affected
He was at his best when he sang about the loneliness, perseverance and dreams of ordinary people.  In "Sandra" for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour.  The combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique.  In the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions.  He released a few inspired tracks now and then, his first Christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth, and "Here at the Mayflower" was a sincere effort. He is an intelligent person who cares for music and doesn't let his superstardom go to his head.  So, what has changed?  And why this late in his career?  Barry has reinvented himself as a Las Vegas entertainer, Liberace style.  And he's released an album with unchallenging versions of evergreens.  I have no doubt that he genuinely wants to make people happy, like Liberace did.  And I have deep respect for that.  But I personally regret that Clive Davis and Manilow have now decided to manufacture products for a larger audience - one that doesn't really have any demands.   
 I won't dispute Emmylou's wonderful voice and Mark Knopfler's superb guitar playing but this album just didn't cut it for me. Pretty lame, about as likely as Hank and Phoebe Snow
Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original.Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya
my review is written here only for seekers of obscure nine inch nails songs. for a full review of the soundtrack in its entirety read elsewhere-there are many other reviews.i have all 19 halos, and exclusive and unreleased remixes and demos, and i love all of it, including the entirety of the fragile, fixed, perfect drug versions, still, further down the spiral v1 and v2, the deluxe edition of the downward spiral, on and on, everything....except deep.deep is truly the only nine inch nails song not worth having.painfully uninspired and recycled, musically, lyrically, and visually (the video was an embarassment- again, the only one in a catalogue of otherwise disturbing, beautiful brilliance), DEEP is a song and phase trent himself has admitted to wishing to forget entirely.my advice: take it as a mark that he is, after all, human, but leave it here on the tomb raider soundtrack, unpaid for, for it will never show up on an official halo as burn (originally for natural born killers), dead souls (joy division cover originally for the crow), and the perfect drug (originally for lost highway) all have in time (the former two on halo 8 DE and the latter on halos 11, 12, and 15 in extended form)
It's sad that people can get a record deal for beinga good kareoke singer. Yeah, maybe my fish can get a record deal: They "sing" in tone, can breath, but refue to lip-synch(I know it sounds gay). This is just sad because bands that PLAY THEIR OWN INSTRUMENTS, WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS, and PERFORM THEIR OWN SONGS can pretty much get almost no attention. Let's take the band King's X: Doug Pinnick (vocals/bass) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about God (King's X is a Christian band); Ty Tabor (guitar/vocals) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably don't know; and Jerry Gaskill (drums/vocals) has some pretty complicated rhythm patterns...yet only like a few dozen people (I know a lot more people than that like KX; I'm just exagerating) seem to like this band. It's sad. If you want good music, listen to the band I just menioned (King's X if you weren't paying attention).(If amazon doesn't post this I will SERIOUSLY get POed!
This was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the Mid Nineties G-Funk heyday. Warren G. didn't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard/soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before. The skits are ridiculous, the music is halfass, and the lyrics are amateur. There is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener's attention for a whole album. This is similar to other West Coast rap albums that play it too safe such as W.C. and the Madd Circle's debut and Coolio's "It Takes A Thief". One star for the hit single "Summertime in the L.B.C.".
I remember this album well; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer', as it was released well before "Under The Bridge" made them the bandwagon band of the year, but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right--they never had a good album.For every song worth listening to ("Suck My Kiss", "Give It Away"), there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded.  This album was and remains a perfect example of why bands shouldn't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can.On top of that, the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief.  Some friends and I got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album, and Kiedis was so off-key, it wasn't funny.  They drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals, but the damage was done.  People were walking out in droves
Even as a joke, this would be horrible; however, I think this band take it seriously - and it blows!  I picked up this CD because I heard A.R.E. were like a combination of suicide, front 242, and iron maiden: Interesting.  NO!!  A.R.E. are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down Liars at best.  The guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse.   Example: "Hey World" begins with how much it sucks to be 13.  When I saw Pelican in concert, they were opening (?!?!?) for A.R.E., so I decided to give them a second chance.  The sound guy must not have liked what he heard, because the bar chatter was louder.  "Louder" I yelled, so that I might find something redeeming in their music.  "Yeah, SUCK louder!" Someone else yelled - I had to agree  give him a high-five.  Maybe I would have liked this when I was 12 and didn't know any better.  ZERO STARS
I remember listening to this years ago, and I thought I would add this to my cd library, now I know why it has been years sense I've listened to it,, very sqeaky, dull, slow paced stuff, Bob Segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil..
I bought this cd because I figured it would be a fresh take on some old favoirites. Well, I'd like to say I loved it, but I didnt. This cd just comes off as flat and lifeless. Where as the original songs, the Kyle Toucher on vocals versions, had a certain edge, the remakes make great material sound very mediocre. For those of you first discovering Dr. Know,l this may be the greatest cd in the world...the material is that good-but, if you really want to experience Dr. Know, buy their Best of CD that was released on Mystic Records. This is the best version of Dr. Know. Hope this helps
I was disappointed when I received this CD.  Although it is original, the music is hard for me to listen for more than a minute or two.By your side, (my favorite) is good for about two minutes.  Then the beat gets off track, and starts to sound terrible.  If this was done on purpose, I cannot fathom why.I know this is "lo-fi", but a hint of bass wouldn't hurt at all.  As it stands, the CD sounds like an unfinished product, and is not nearly good enough to stand on its own.I think this CD would best be used for some sampling...especially in today's hip-hop.  If you are looking for beautiful, relaxing music...look elsewhere
Not particularly musical; only 1 good track (Blues for Miles)..
The "drummer" (more like "The Anti-Drummer") on this is Johnny Cresci.  He is maddeningly lacking in even basic garage band ability, and literally has no idea what a 6/8 blues meter is.  How he landed on the same stage with these legends may be the musical mystery of all time.  For me, Mr. "Clueless" Cresci makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the brilliant performances going on despite his anti-rhythmic upchucking.....kinda like driving an Aston Martin with a flat tire!  I have tried to get beyond Cresci's chops for over a year of listening now, and I simply can't do it.  If you're a musician, his playing will make you extremely agitated.  I'm gonna have to trade this in, and go on listening to Live Adventures like I have for the past 37 years.  This would have been much better with the drum tracks totally muted on the 6/8 numbers.  Granted, this is an historically significant release, but I think it should have stayed in the vault, or released with Johnny Cresci having been digitally removed or replaced
isn't wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a 21st century version of Al Jolson? the problem with so many new-traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience. hippies and white liberals love it, but where does that leave those that are living it? far better capturing the Latina experience are Julietta Venegas, south of the border, and east LA's Lysa Flores, north of the border
A terrible, terrible waste of money. All this CD serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head Paul Godfrey is. Face it: no one gives a sh@t about Morcheeba anymore, we're not interested in who 'inspired' them, (poor Annette Peacock - has anyone told her?). The next time we see Paul Godfrey he'll probably be asking that age-old question: paper or plastic?
This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable, emotionally charged pep rally.  It really upsets me that this is the face of today's Christian music.  The melodies are not easily singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches.  This is worship manipulation at it's best.  If you read the words to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of substance.  They talk about actions to give God and our response to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this.  God IS great, but WHY?  This is VERY disturbing, and completely unacceptable for congregational worship. 
I never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but I love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are American country music songs. Can't say I'm much of a fan of American country music so was just a bit disappointed. I think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the CD. Was also disappointed that Danny Elfman's Desperate Housewives Theme is not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track attached to it. The Desperate Housewives Theme goes for 0:44 seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the TV show mentioning Wisteria Lane over and over again follows for a minute and twenty seconds. What ligic was there in not making this a separate track? You would then be able to memory it out on your stereo. I like listening to TV themes and I find this just ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press skip after 0:44 seconds. This CD is worth purchasing for the sound bites alone but I guess if you're just buying it for the theme song you'll have to wait for some other new TV theme compilation album to get the theme song on its own. This album also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of great pictures of characters and scenes from the show.
A friend of mine turned me on to Spoon, and at first I listened enthusicatically... but then I got bored. Although Spoon's songs may be catchy at times, they are empty and deviod of any alterations. The same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so, but in the end I don't think I've ever listened to an entire track. If this is 5 star music today, our culture is severely lacking depth
Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days. Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time. I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45
i like how the people on here who turn to sarcasm when rating this cd think they're funny.  heh, so witty.  anywho i'm not a big fan of fall out boy, but there are a couple of good songs on this cd........notably grand theft autumn and saturday.  those are really the only two that hold up its rating for me tho...2 stars
Great recording, but if you want to actually use it, like load it on your ipod it has sony's stupid DRM. Meaning you can't. DON'T BUY SONY PRODUCTS!!
Apart from the great selection of soundtracks, what really makes this compilation top value is the quality of the sound processing. Executed with finesse, these tracks sound better than when first issued and many are unedited, fuller versions: like "Singing In The Rain", for example. Throw in the great price, and this double disc set is a "must have" for all lovers of classic movie music
After reading her excellent Halloween book, I figured her Halloween CD would be worth owning. I always search for "different" Halloween CDs, but this was filled with the same old stuff.Chains, moans, and spooky laughs... then more chains, moans and spooky laughs. Very dissapointing
I bought this album because I am so into Sigur Ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews I read say that "...if you like Sigur Ros you will like MBV.." Let me say this album is no where near a Sigur Ros experience. If  I could compare them to anyone it would be very early Cocteau Twins , though I must be clear I don't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of Elizabeth Fraser.It would be more palatable if the production value was higher....it sounds terrible. The sound quality is comparable to some old VHS tapes I have from the mid 80's that I recorded off the TV ( Then soaked in water for a few days!) .
I can't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of S$#!?*%#!#$!There are a couple good ones,but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d,not even at a used price.I can't believe they did'nt put "Low Rider" on the soundtrack,how cheap is that
I forgot how bad this album was until I popped it into my CD player the other day.It seems like every song has one or two parts that are totally killer, followed by 3-4 minutes of boredom.  The song "Epic Problem" is good throughout, and Full Disclosure is EXCELLENT except for the horrible screamed verses.  Strangelight is awesome too, and not very typical of Fugazi.  The Kill is also good in the same way, it's very chilled out.  Past these few standout tracks(which wouldn't be standouts at all on any other album of theirs) there isn't much reason to listen to the album.  It's incredibly boring.I suggest picking up any other fugazi album first, maybe 13 songs, red medicine or in on the kill taker
Simply put, Jay-Z is incredibly overrated.  I own a couple of his CDs but to be honest, I never really liked him.  His beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that I just had to go back and listen to a specific song again.  He mostly raps about drugs, money and cars.  Nothing special, nothing new. I'm just being real about it, since everyone else is on his d!ck.  I think the reason he's so respected is because he blew up right after Biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time.  Granted, Jay-Z does use some good metaphors, but for the most part his lyrics are shallow. Best tracks on this album:Can't Knock the HustleBrooklyn's Finest w/BiggieDead President
"What's Up", the catchy song with the acousitc guitar out of tune (which, I always thought, would have been the perfect song  for Heart), is the only thing good here.  The rest of this album is a mess.  Linda Perry has, of course, gone on to better things
I just sold this back through Amazon, I was so disapointed with it. It's an all cover record, and while Greg Duhli does add an interesting twist to the covers, all of the music feels too subdued, too flat.Duhli is lacking the usual passion he brought to the Whigs and the first Twilight Singers recording.
As long as artists keep making albums with only one good song, people will keep getting them for free in internet.  Nestor keeps insisting in doing instrumental hip hop, pop, commercial, elevator music.  If you like that kind of music, buy this CD, otherwise buy Hubert Laws, or Dave Valentin among others.  If you want to listen to good Nestor music, buy "Morning Ride", "Dance Of The Phoenix", "Talk To Me", "Mi Alma Latina" or the charanga album " Mis Canciones Primeras".  Sorry Nestor, I am a big fan of your music but you are wasting your talent doing this kind of stuff.  When do you plan to make a good non commercial latin jazz album
Yo Gotti in the past can spit some raw ish but on this one, I dunno what happpened.....The production seemed too generic, the rapping was pretty average and generic and not that impressive at all, and doesnt carry much replay value....To be honest, id pop in a Three 6  Mafia cd rather than this one....Album was slacking on so many levels, now theres some tracks that listenable, but the rest make it hard to enjoy this album, nothin special bout it at all...This album waz overhyped I believe and flopped horribly.......Gotti can do much better than this.....Wouldnt recommend anyone to chek it out.....2.5/
This album was one of my biggest "mistakes" (bought it 3 years ago).It's childish songwriting and really not good enough for an alternative-rock-band. Better you buy instead: UP THE BRACKET (THE LIBERTINES) orsome STROKES-stuff..
With 2 cds of endless repeated chords, they don't have much to say
I can understand that Robin felt a need to include some of the biggest Bee Gees hits to appease the fans, but the ones that were sung by Barry are below wretched here.  Robin frequently disappears in the sound mix, becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony.  That's fine for a group concert, like the Bee Gees, but inexcusable for a solo effort.  His stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act.  They should have kept this in the can.  It seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for Robin. Don't do him the favor
This is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected. Lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself. Then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie, the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper. Queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music. This is ridiculous! Kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game. Please please please spare us and stop rapping
I just wanted to let you know about a copyright situation. In this movie there is a part where they are sitting in a mexican food restuarant and there is a song playing in the back round. That song is not listed on the song track and I think it should be. The song is Atrevido by Orishas. I think this is wrong.
what a terrible excuse for music from generally excellent musicians. It sounds like ESPN called them asked them to put a diddy together and 10 minutes later....presto ...instant mush
A friend who knows my taste in music recommended VNV Nation to me, so I got Matter + Form based on the reviews.  In one sense I like it.  The production is excellent and I find every track to be creative and unique.  But I HATE the vocals and so I can't bear to listen to the CD.  This dude has the worst voice in music history. 
This has got to be the worst pile of trash I ever heard, right now I cant think of anything worse then this. The same ol trash bling and girls. And if you got JD and Bow wow on your album at the same time, its gonna be wack. And do these n***** even know what franchise mean? What does that word have to do with their name? I'll just start a click called ham  cheese and rap about flip flops and thongs for that matter
I LOVE Destiny's Child...BUT this CD...big disappointment. The best songs on the entire CD were probably Lose My Breath,Cater 2 U and Girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the CD when i bought it..
What they said was that Katy can't rock just yet because she's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme.  I saw her live on the Chicks with Attitude tour with Liz Phair and the Cardigans and Charlotte Martin and Rose was the worst performer of the night.  The first problem is that her voice just isn't that strong, secondly, her lyrics never come out as if they're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say.  Throughout her set, there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing (passingly honest as well) and that was "Snowflake."  It's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she's lived in California for a long time, but she hates warm weather, sounds impossible, but she must be truthful because it's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft.  I'm sure she has potential for the future, but I think on her next album she should take a hint from Beth Orton who's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop.  Stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out, and I think that could be helpful for her to put on record
John Mayer can grow his hair long and play his guitar slung low, but he is still a professionaly trained monkey, I mean musician. Mayer along with "artists" like Gavin DeGraw, Teddy Geiger, etc., are todays N'Sync and Backstreet Boys, nothing more. 
I can't say I liked this CD.  Jessica Simpson was good when she started, but as her popularity has grown, her talents have declined.  She commited murder the day she recorded Senatra's song for "The Dukes of Hazard" movie
The songs just did not get me dancing.  I have to say I was disappointed.  But I love Kids Favorite Songs VOl 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl
Wow!  Tom Morello, Flea, Pete Yorn, Chris Cornell, Brad Wilk, Maynard James Keenan.  When I first heard of this superstar line-up, I was sure that this CD was going to be awesome.  I was duped like everyone else who bought this album.  Axis of Justice (or so cleverly put by a previous reviewer as "Axis of Jackasses") is really a bad album, even for a bunch of political liberal rockers.  Serj and Tom really dropped the ball with this one. What could've been a festoon of awesomeness turned out to crap-fest of whiny musicians with an equally crappy message.  Knowledge, The Night Watchmen, and Ahmed Ahmed are among the many reasons why this is so bad and incredibly difficult to listen to.  The song,"Jeffrey, Are You Listenng?" is up there with other crappy songs like John Mayer's "City Love" and Richard Harris' "MaCarthur Park."  On top of all that, the communist entertainer known as Michael Moore adds his little nugget of wisdom on the DVD, which I can say I've become dumber now that I've listened to it.  For the love of all good music, stay far away from this CD
all i got to say about this is that dudes need to stop making this kinds of records cuz this is not hip hop, its not what LL, Rakim, KRS-one, Kool G Rap, Ice T, Ice Cube, NWA, and (rip) BIG AND PAC, started.  We as fan have the power to end this buy simply not buying the album.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS, THIS FAKE RAP IS GOT TO STO
This stuff is so boring. I can't believe people still listen to this stuff. Seriously come on people! I laugh every time I see some guy trying to play this stuff anywhere. Plus Busta has admitted to having "relationships" with men if you get what I mean. Makes you wonder about a lot of rappers....
Wow, I can not believe that two of the best songs of the film were cut off. 1.- Rock and roll part II ( Gary Glitter) and 2.-Get it on (T. Rex).The rest has been said in the other costumers reviews.
can it be that people are letting their personal beliefs block the receptors in the brain that signal bad music?  ive listened to many bob dylan albums, and every one is a gem.  freewheelin' is my favorite, but so what?  it doesn't matter which ones we love, because we all know what bob dylan's worst record was, and its saved.  im not one to question this man's beliefs or anything like that, bob dylan deserves all the respect in the universe, but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer to christian music to help us all see how bad it is?  could he have made the transfer to make a mockery of the christian faith?  almost certainly not.  but only a seriously bad album could have planted these seeds in my brain
This is an endurance test. As in 'bitches brew''live evil''love at the Fillmore' latter day Miles consists of moments of brilliance combined with long stretches of absolute tedium. It makes 'jack johnson' a real non event and considering the quality of musicians on board it is a real surprise. Take 'yesternow' it takes for ever for Billy Cobham to find a beat. This is just self indulgence of the worse kind, a trait which unfortunately perpetrated a lot of the jazz fusion crossovers. Miles seems to want to create 'moods' and ends up with twenty minute plus of wallpaper music. This album is the complete nadir of his jazz crossover period. McGaughlin's guitar though breathtaking in the Mahavisuna orchestra here contents himself with silly little runs, totally without any structure and fire (this unfortunately was the same throughout his stay with Miles) Disjointed would be too kind a word. When you reliased that this was edited from long jams it makes you wonder how dull the unreleased parts were (i dread to even contemplate). Miles playing though usually inspired and lyrical here struggles to solo over the fast tempo's and is embarassingly weak. Maybe if i saw the film it was supposed to accompany i might view this differant, but without that it is just a meandering and unfocused mess
This is the album when Ja officially became a b*tch. His first 2 albums was good, I enjoyed them both and those are highly recommended. I hated this s*it from start to finish. This is a waste of space in the cd case. How can you be a murderer and a singer at the same time? Now I don't mind too much about redoing a song about or with a dead rapper, BUT YOU SHOULD'VE AT LEAST KNEW HIM MUTHAF***ER! Another disembowelment to one of Pac's classics. I stopped listenin' to Ja because he made a big change. Not cause of 50. Unlike some turncoat fans.
Mississippi and Sugar Baby are great songs, up there with the best Dylan has done. However, the rest of the album, while listenable, isn't all that memorable. Still, I suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still, after over 40 years performing and recording. The same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the Stones.Overall, Time Out of Mind was better, although that too was a little overrated, with only Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway and Trying to Get to Heaven truly belonging to the canon of great Bob songs. 
I want this guy to succeed so badly, yet he just couldn't pull it off. His voice has a great sound to it, pleasant to the ears, yet his interpretation was just not there. His  phrasing was very lazy and boring most times. It seemed like he didn't know where to start the next word. And he also sounded out of breath. He sounded so out of breath that I started gasping for air...I had to stop listening.  To add to that, John's vibrato sounded washed out and faded in places where it needed to be stronger.I truly hope with age and experience he improves. There's no reason why he should not. He's not in the catagory of a Buble' or Connick Jr. yet.
people this is easy listening at it's easiest. Every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years, that is if it isn't allready. I don't know anything about what they have done in the past, except for a song I remember being played on the radio a few years ago. Must have been on the album prior to this. But that song sounds just like two tracks on this one. Not only that but if there wasn't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests I couldn't really tell any of them apart. Horrible music with no feeling or soul, not even creative. don't waste your time with this.
I never could understand why the Beatles are so popular? They are pretty boring too just like Pink Floyd. Each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about 55 seconds. I just dont like it because it sucks! Dont listen to the moronic 5 star reviewers below. The Beatles only made one good album and that's the one which contains Ballad Of John And Yoko, Hey Jude.
Not the type of music I had envisioned...much slower than I was hoping for.
Although it KILLS me to write anything less than glowing about Edwin McCain (I think he's probably the most talented singer/songwriter we've seen in the last ten years), I just can NOT get into this album.Like others have said, I too have every Edwin album and have seen him in concert. I love everything he's ever done.... but this album just doesn't do it for me. And I know people will say... "Give the album a chance"..... or... "Let Edwin grow and move in new musical directions". BUT..... I've listened to this album at least 10 times all the way through and it's just not growing on me. It feels "flat" and just doesn't feel EDWIN-ISH (if that makes any sense). Even Grammercy Park Hotel, which I saw him debut live and which is on his live DVD doesn't feel the same on here.... just doesn't have the feeling or soul. I would pick up Austin Sessions over this album any day. THAT is Edwin doing what he does best. Maybe he feels the pressure to write some "hits" so that he doesn't have to spend two solid years on the road in the Black Pearl (his tour bus)..... and who could blame him??? But this feels like he's trying too hard.I SOOOOOO hope he comes back with a better album next time, so I can rave about it, because although I gave this album 2 stars.... Edwin, as a person/singer/performer/songwriter deserves 10!!!!!!
This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single "Wolf like me" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very "soulful". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice
I found a supposedly "New remastered edition" of Sade's "Diamond Life" on sale for less than 10 bucks. OOPS! Great mistake! When I tried to return it, the CD store was already out of business, and the copy is one issued in the Netherlands which is marked INTO THE BOOKLET as "2000 Digital Remastered Version". The whole album HAS BEEN RE-RECORDED with new arrangements! The digital sound is quite good, but the new arrangements made for 'Smooth Operator' REALLY SUCKS!!
You win some and you lose some. This purchase was a definite loss. What a dissapointment
These are the same tracks from Totally Buble which was released without Buble's consent."Totally Buble" is not an album that I wanted to be released. They were songs I recorded for a film called "Totally Blonde" many years ago before I was signed to 143/Reprise Records. The decision to release it as an album was made by the film's producer, and I had no control over stopping him.It is important for everyone to know, that I only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and I sincerely apologize if you purchased this album." - Michael Buble
...when you're gearing up for suicide. This whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who's going to just end it all. I found myself suffering nightmares, fatigue, misery and paranoia. My ears unclogged but I started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. This is not a good album for the stressed, because it will just make you feel worse. I find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable. When I first listened to it it sounded inaccessable, after listening to it more and more I started to get more "into" it, but I can't say I found it a good place to be in. It's a somewhat interesting album, but it mostly just dragged me down, made me nervous, numb and hurt my head. People say this is great music. Let them say what they want. Give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that doesn't make a pest of itself. Kid A is just ok to me, and hasn't been worth all the effort to "get into". This almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners. I don't know, maybe I'm missing something, but to hear some "weird" music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears, try "Passengers" by U2.And Thom York sings like a Muppet on this album.  By the way I've enjoyed Radiohead's first three albums quite a bit (including Pablo Honey -- why are people always busting its chops).
I got this CD because I loved their radio hits "Bring Me To Life" and "My Immortal." While those songs are beautiful, they are not representative of the rest of the album. Although I tried and tried to get into this CD, the hard rock teen goth style just isn't my cup of tea, and the lyrics are too depressing. If you are a fan of bands such as Linkin Park or Seether, you might enjoy this. However, if you only like "My Immortal" and "Bring Me To Life" because of Amy's powerful vocals, you'd be better off listening to Tori Amos or Sarah McLachlan.
I was babysitting, and the kid was listening to the CD, and asked why Billie Joe sounded so sick. X
This CD is the worst "comedy" CD I have ever heard.  Yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious????Ok, I've come to the conclusion, the only people writing positive reviews on Amazon MUST be the people trying to sell the junk.I've seen this guy on some tv shows, and on comedy central, and he's a somewhat funny guy, but it is painful to listen to this CD.  You can feel the awkwardness of the crowd, not knowing if or when to laugh.  And it continues throughout the entire CD.  There don't seem to be any jokes on the CD at all.  It is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being.Don't believe me?  Then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk, and see for yourself.Like my review title says, Do NOT read the positive reviews.  Just read the negative ones, and decide how credible they seem.  Then make your decision to buy or not buy
I love Ray Charles when Ray's doing Ray.  This was terrible.  Ray was out of tune, out of touch and the song selection was ridiculous.  I'm sorry Ray, I love you.  It's a shame this had to be one of your last CD's
It really doesn't appeal to me. But if you like them that is your opinion. I'm not going to say your stupid for liking them because your different from me. But I just feel that there is way to much cursing for my liking I mean the creativity here is not very high I just feel you could use better words. But I mean THE MEASURE OF A MAN IS NOT HOW MANY GIRLS YOU SLEPT WITH. I mean that is how you lose money on child support. Sex has never been the most important thing in life.Honestly though I mean you just can't see these guys rapping about these same things when they're 40 right cause that is wrong. I mean why be interested in a group of rappers that in 10 years probably wont be making music anymore let alone still be together
Cheap Trick's second album is very disappointing to me afterthe good, but raw, "Live In The Studio", 1977-76 recordedCheap Trick. Almost all of the material here is so watered down that it REALLY COMES OFF WAY BETTER on the later many Live disks they did.After a good start w/ "Hello There", a concert favorite for many years, is the only thing here to write home about when one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the Budokan and other Live recordings later.Tom Werman and Rick Niesen were on a show in 1991 that I hadrecorded on a tape once and Werman, noce a friend of Tom Petersson's said, quote: "My three albums with Cheap Trickgot better and better...", to which the ever sarcastic RickNielsen said, "Selling, maybe." Not realizing that brotherRick was slamming him, Werman then continued, "Exactly"...Oh boy. We now see why producing Cheap Trick albums throughthe years has become like playing Russian Roulette. It's nothard to get better than this and five months later the solid,but somewhat oeverrated 'Heaven Tonight' came out...(And theguys EVEN bought Werman back for Dream Police. Things turned out better when Pete Comita, then later Jon Brant joined theband. Yep - the best was yet to come - in the '80'
  DIS GY IS DA KYING OF DA SOUTH!!! Give me a f***ing break. When are we going to stop seeing crappy rapper after even crappier rappers that are so full of themselves that they feel the need to plasture their faces all over every one of their crappy unintelligent so called albums!! Nothing descent to say at all, just a bunch of mindless [...]. I bet you they don't even like music, they just want to be a "celebrity"  and be rich for 3 years(till their broke). If they really did geniunly like music, it wouldn't sound that sh**y!!!! GET OVER YOURSELVES!!! 
This is the only album I own of Joe Strummer minus The Clash. I can't say it's very good. I hate having to compare it with it with his work with The Clash but it's inevitable. His lyrics aren't as great, edgy or provocative. There isn't any fantastic music either. I am not really sure what to say since I haven't listened to the album in so long because it was so bad, I truly tried my hardest to like it. But I feel it is my duty to advise others to not make the same mistake. Believe me: I absolutely love everything about The Clash, the lyrics, Joe's voice, the music, the attitude and how cool they were, this is not Joe at his best, it's cool though cause now he's gone: go buy some Bob Marley albums instead, Joe would not have minded
Boney used to be the man, but now he has 2 crappy releases behind him. Anyone who thinks this CD is good should listen to his older stuff like Seduction, Trust, or Backbone. You will quickly realize that he has not been living up to his full potential. Cmon'Boney lets get back to multi-dimentional stuff that you used to be the master of. Peace
This collection is a must have if you like the Bee Gees and don't have any of their albums...or even if you do. It's one hit after another plus some I've never heard, which is nice for variety. I couldn't ask for a better collection - it's like I had burned this for myself. 
This album isn't not very good at all.  There are about four songs I like.  First off, the production on this CD is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats.  Then, the guest artists do a sub-par job lyrically.  Then, there are no new verses from Biggie, on the album.  They should have stopped with Born Again, because album will be a forgotten one, not a great way to close out the legecy of Bigge Smalls
For starters I love Bun B and Pimp C and UGK and all that but the thing that kills it is Lil Jon yelling "gansta grizzel" like 10 times in every track. I love lil Jon too, but they coulda done without it. also they just rappin over other peps beats, it just sounds like a mixed tape kinda deal. but heard rumor that bun b is bout to come out with an offical bun b record, not a mixed tape, or nothin like that, but only reason why i gave it two stars is just cuz they got tight flows on the tracks, but not their own beats, and lil jon coulda just shut the hell up on those tracks. just keepin it real. i wouldnt spend the money, id just wait for bun b to release his own offical cd, or till pimp c get out and ugk hooks it back up
Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days. Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time. I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45
JJ, the name of the song you are looking for is "Like You Like An Arsonist" by Paris Texas
I just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song.  Thanks to Melania for pointing out the song title at the end. I realize this CD is just a soundtrack, but typically most soundtracks also include the ending songs. It is just plain dumb not to include the best music in this CD.  MY VOTE - DO NOT BUY THIS CD. The soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff.  BUT GET THE ENDING TITLE SONG IF YOU CAN - It's great. 
Bands from the 90s just sucked and Nirvana fits in with that. They had a couple of ok songs and Kurt Cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about. I can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were. I don't see it. This is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music.
Etta never fails to deliver in the vocals. Gutteral bombast, sweet soul, gospel, blues, the lady is a living legend. But this album, like the last album "produced" by her son, is a nightmare. Chessy arrangments, tinkly bass, poor sound all around. She is a fierce mother and I'm sure she thinks her kids know best, but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists with the right producer. Should Etta get the chance to work with a fresh ear at the deck, she wouldn't need the novelty of some of the song choices. PS - 200lbs lighter and she remains the best live performer; blues, R/B, soul, whatever,  in the world.
or in their entire career for that matter.  I have tried to like this band, but Greg Dulli just won't shut up.  Every song is his snide lyrical diatribing, on and on and on.  The guitarist keeps things mildly interesting, but on this album in particular, the drummer also won't shut up and play a straight beat for once.  It's like three guys in their own worlds, and they mash it together and call what they've done songs.  EXCEPT for the one decent song they did, the only rock song I can think of that is hard, psychedelic, passionate, powerful, and set to a waltz beat of all things.  "LEt me lie to you" is the best song they ever made, BECAUSE everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song's framework and tempo.  Instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do, everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses, and it's less muddled and better orchestrated for it.  IT's a shame they didn't do any other songs like this, at least none that I have heard.  I tried to like them, I really did.  I wanted to find the band that made that one song, and discover a whole treasure chest of dark, passionate, noisy music like that.  Too bad, no wonder they drifted apart
All the cds this band has made suck. Not even the first one so never buy something this idiots have made. Blink-182, Sugarcult or Sum 41 are good punk-pop
There are 2 good songs on this disc, Stinkfist and Aenema. The rest are pure crap. Half of the tracks aren't even songs, they're just a bunch of noise. No wonder Tool won't put any of thier music on itunes or napster. They want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your $14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap. If you gave this CD 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely
Reviewgium - Volume I, issue XVIIOver sixty and still going strong, Neil Young has released a new album, largely politcal and essentially a focused attack on U.S. President George W. Bush. As opposed to his last album which was a more bittersweet, country-tinged effort, Living With War is a pretty much straightforward rock album, mostly electric with a background choir featured on many tracks, as well as an unusually predominant trumpet player on several tracks. Musically, it's nothing spectacular, in fact every song more or less follows the same tired formula, and there are really no diversions from the grunge-like rhythm guitar chords. But the album is obviously intended to have a major focus on the vocals and lyrics. Of course, many people do not like Neil Young's vocals, but there are many well-developed choral passages throughout the album, including a soulful, a capella arrangement of "America the Beautiful," which closes the album. So basically, I feel the vocal performances compensate--though not totally--for the lack of musical diversity. Lyrically, the album is pretty blatant; it could almost be a 60's protest album. But underlying that, is a ray of hope and an urge to change our country for the better.There are a few decent tracks on the album, even if they are not exactly mind-blowing (not that Neil Young was ever a showboater). "After the Garden" is actually quite a good song as is "Shock and Awe." "Flags of Freedom" is a bit of an upper, so I can probably call that the album highlight, though I'm sure the more politically-minded citizen will enjoy "Let's Impeach the President," an almost humorous overview of Bush's faltering standpoints. The final three songs divert from the general theme of dismay and protest, and offer feelings of hope and introspection.If you are not a fan of Neil Young, you'll find nothing here that will convert you, so you may just want to leave this on the shelf. If you are "anti-Bush" you might get a buzz off of the lyrical aspect, but that's probably the only thrill you will get. I tend to avoid anything political, so music aside, this album's message does not really appeal to me. It's like, yeah, people hate the President, blah blah blah, we know...give it a rest. For fans of Neil, I wouldn't exactly say "you're not missing anything" by avoiding this album; there is some good stuff on there, but you might want to wait until you see it cheap in the "used" bin at your local CD shop. And for those interested, this is not a Crazy Horse album.
In the past, I used to distance myself from certain rock genres because of a bad first experience. I'd be introduced to band, not like it, and claim the entire genre as being 'not for me'. The Forecast, however, has changed how I feel. I, personally, love a heartfelt emo record just as much as the next guy, but only because I was introduced to Jimmy Eat World and Spitalfield a couple of years back. Those bands allowed me to embrace the entire genre as a whole, and expand my emo knowledge. Imagine though, if you will, that I was new to emo. You, in theory, hand me a copy of "late night conversations" and tell me to listen. Of course, I hate it, and lose any interest I may have had in the genre. To make a long story short, the only good that came out of 'late night conversations' (an underproduced, generic, stale piece of s**t) was the revelation that came post-listen. Never judge an entire genre by the first or second band you're introduced to (from said entire genre). Not every metal band is Iron Maden. Not every punk-pop band is blink 182. Not every nu-metal band is linkin park. Not every 'emo' band is jimmy eat world. Every aspect of music has it's ups and downs, and the forecast is clearly one of the downs.Now that I've bored you with an entire rant about nothing, I'd like you to PASS on 'late night conversations'. With your help, the forecast won't sell another record, and, in turn, leave the scene forever. Not recommended, duh
Beautiful voice, but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd.  I was offended just reading every name on this cd...It is really a shame, what  pretty "vulgar" voice.  If this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears.  You should be ashamed of yourself as an artist, as you have such power, but it is spent on prepetuating hate.  Nina Simone was a angry artist also, but not once did she offend me (caucasian male) with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america.  The first song I ever heard of hers "Mississippi Goddam" made me cry, so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice.  There will always be a "racist america" because people are selfish, but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist.  I liked the cd until I heard the lyrics, one less sale adds up after awhile
ashlee's recent face lift and apparent nose job is proof that's she's all plastic and no talent. she must of asked the Dr to make her look like her sister. very sad cause she's unrecognizable now. better looking, maybe, still can't sing or dance.
The people who have mentioned Aphex Twin and Four Tet have clearly never listened to either of these artists. If you liked the Stone Roses you will like this. It's not an 'electronic' album at all. I've ordered Manitoba's earlier cd after listening to the samples (the reason for purchasing both these albums) and I certainly hope it sounds nothing like 'Up in Flames'. It's funny, I promised myself I would never buy an album again without listening to it and yet it seems that samples on the net can be misleading, either that or Dan Snaith has had a serious identity crisis in the last few years
I love The Who, a big part of my youth, probably in my DNA, but let's not kid ourselves: This is professional rock and roll made by professional rock and rollers. Is there any lyric here that Pete hasn't written before? Still writing about getting your first hit single?! And sadly the music sounds like Face Dances and All the Best Cowboys..etc, but not The Who Sell Out or Empty Glass. The band itself sounds faceless, generic. The only redeeming features are the raspy passion in Roger's voice and Pete's right hand. I hope the complete album makes garbage of this review, but unless Pete has written truthfully and passionately about something or anything of what his life and the world has been like in the last twenty years I'm afraid, like Wire  Glass, it will only be a rehash of previous works, no matter how good it sounds. Here's hoping I'm wrong
Some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated.  I am writing to confirm that assertion.  I have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me.  It sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down.Jack's appreciation of the blues is admirable, but only realised on the song "I Fought Piranhas".  Tellingly, this is the final song on the album.  Otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times.
In answer to a music fan from Temple Hills, the song was called King Holiday by the King Dream Chorus  Holiday Crew. It came out on Mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned. It made no.30 on the RB Charts but didn't crossover pop. The lyrics are on the net (try Google) but I don't know if the song still is
of every band/group, there is always the weak link, Tony Yayo proves that he is the one with Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon.  Many of the songs are not produced by Dr. Dre (one of the few things that G-Unit has going for them) resulting in "greasy" and bad beats.  Tony Yayo cant seem to trun his mouth away from drug trafficing, being locked up in prison, hoes, ect.  He lyrics aren't all that great either, making him have the worst voice in G-unit as well.  He sounds almost as if he is my grandfather- maybe as a result of getting locked up.  The few pluses on the album are "Drama Setter" feat. Eminem and Obie Trice followed by Eminem's constant adreniline rushing sound and beats (even though he only is apart of the chorus-a big mistake) as well as "G-S**t".  My advice, download these two songs- this CD isn't worth $14.00
Well, I like the song "I shall believe" and that's why I purchased this Album, but it would have been better to buy just the single
I'm sure it was fun for Van to record a bunch of songs he likes, but overall this would have made for a disappointing bootleg.  Thanks for all the great music through The Healing Game.  All good times have to come to an end
it sounds like someone somehow got the deftones to suck worse than they already do. this album isn't nearly as musically interesting as tear from the red. i don't mind the singers new approach to vocals, but it just sounded like they didn't try at all. all the songs sound the same, the tempo is too fast on almost all the songs for the screamo sound, and hearing random voices and sounds of them in the studio between recordings just makes the album drag. although they've goten much tighter as a band and aren't as sloppy as they used to be, (they fell out of sync a lot in the opposite of december) this album was definitely a backwards step in their progression as real musicians. save your money and buy tear from the red instead
I gave 2 star for this CD not because of the musical quality...but because the last song "Goodnight My Love" is cut short on this CD.After watching the live performance on cable, I rushed out to buy this CD, labeled by Hybrid. Only to find out my favorite song "Goodnight My Love" was cut short. On the CD, it ends with  the sax doing a solo then fades away....which leaves the song dangling and unfinished!!!   On the video, this song ends with Art singing "bring you closer to me" and the music slowly ends beautifully, correctly.There's a version out which was released by Sony in 2003. I don't know if this version contains the full song.The Hybrid Label version is simply ridiculous!!!  How can you possibly end such a beautiful song short!! leaving it unfinished....and well....SHORT and listeners wanting more!!!If someone can verify if the Sony conatins the full "Goodnight My Love"...or tell me where I can get this verson,  would really appreciate it
I've seen and heard Sheryl live when she's not surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs.  She's great - she's hip, self-assured and kicks butt!  But here, she tells the audience in "Leaving Las Vegas":  "I'm playing Central Park tonight... but I have some friends coming up so can you be patient...Please? For lil' ol' me? Be very patient...." almost begging the audience not to walk out while she's singing solo.  It's almost as if she knows that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the "friends" arrive.  The irony is that Sheryl solo is the best part of the album.   With the others on board, we can't see what Sheryl can do, and those familiar with her know that Sheryl is capable of a lot.   She's overwhelmed by Keith Richard, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Chrissie Hynde and by including so many rock gods she herself is diminished in importance and stature.  Her songs "It Don't Hurt" and "There Goes the Neighborhood" stand out on the album showing that Sheryl can rock harder and better than any of her "friends." Too bad she didn't include "Am I Getting Through" -- the Part 2 of that was a great rock moment.  Natalie Maines' grating voice (like fingernails on a chalkboard) completely ruin "Strong Enough."  Chrissie sounds like a zombie on "If It Makes You Happy", Sarah McLaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and white-bread in her Lilith-Fair mode that she adds nothing to "A Difficult Kind"...in fact, by the end of the song Sarah seems to disappear from the song as Sheryl belts it to the end.  That's Sheryl's song and should remain so,  Tombstone Blues stands out for its guitar work and the best part of "All I Wanna Do" is the New York audience.  Happy, White Room and Gold Dust Woman are three classic rock standards, so overplayed that anyone who grew up to 70's FM AOR radio has heard them ad nauseaum.  Problem here is that nothing new is added to them, they sound like karaoke versions.  Despite Sheryl's plea for patience, I was bored with the old-timers.They didn't bring Sheryl's career forward, only backwards

I own this set, as does my roomate, and we both hate it. It highlights bands like 'red lorry, yellow lorry' that no one likes or listens to, and  uses great classic bands like Bauhaus' worst song as the first track. It is  the hollow, tin-y, embarrassingly hokey side of goth, and i am ashamed to  even have it in my house
I love Patti, and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date. This one is not good at all. This a low point in Patti's career, and God knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk. Live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what I can see on tv. I really wanted to like this, but "ain't no way" this song should have been remade by Patti and Mary who has a pitch issue. If you cannot do a song justice, don't sing it!!!!! Patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers, but singing high notes don't "make" a song, interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics. Patti and Mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register. Patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one. This cd came and went, period! I literally gave it away!!!!!
I agree complete with Erik Cobbett. This is Covenant's most unnecessary and boring album ever. There are a couple of nice parts on it, but generally it's a big disappointment.
Generally on Amazon.com, the average rating of an album does not accurately indicate its quality - that is, the albums are usually highly overrated. This is probably due to the voluntary nature of the reviews and the fact that the fans of an artist are far more likely to review their albums and give them high scores than a casual music listener giving them the score they deserve. As a result of this, generally, albums that have an average score of 4.5 - 5 stars are usually excellent albums. Ones with a score of 4 are generally good and 3.5 indicates a pretty average album. Average scores any lower than 3.5 stars generally indicate a pretty poor album. As I mentioned before, due to the high proportion of fans reviewing albums, the average score rarely falls below 3 stars. It takes a pretty horrendous album, like Limp Bizkit's Results May Vary, to get a score of even 2.5. In fact, I didn't even think that it was possible for an album to get less than 2.5 - that is, until I saw this pile of feces.Now to put this average score of 2 into context - this means that the proportion of "hataz" reviewing this album is even more than the proportion of fans reviewing it. Out of all the terrible albums I have viewed, I have never seen this happen before. Not even to bands as terrible as Limp Bizkit or even An*l C*nt. This obviously indicates a decline in fan numbers and, hopefully, the end of Chingy's 15 minutes of fame
It's Loud.  You can't hear the lyrics nor the words.  Just a lot of loud noise.  Great if you want to damage your hearing
There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. "Songs of Judy Garland" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what "look" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child.  Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of "makeover". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to "Liza Minnelli" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't
I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime
Okay, I will admit to liking Poor Tom, Bonzo's whatever (it sure beats Moby Dick!) and Wearing and Tearing, but other than that this is a collection of outtakes that should've stayed outtakes. Low points include We're Gonna Groove, the live I Can't Quit You Baby, Walter's Walk and Ozone Baby. It's a shame that Traveling Riverside Blues and Hey Hey, What Can I Do were left off this album, and included only in the boxed set reissue - it's the only place you can find Hey Hey, What Can I Do, one of my favorite Zeppelin songs, and with Riverside Blues, you have a choice: Shell out $100 to get it, or sit through the crappy BBC Sessions album. If you're obsessed with the band, I guess this would be good for you. But the best version of Coda is in the aforementioned $100 boxed set.
I purchased this album because I am a fan of the Last Poets.  Upon listening to the samples provided by Amazon.com, I thought I was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the Last Poets: some great politically charged poetry, perhaps accompanied by some funky beats.  However, when I listened to the whole CD, I was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like "Get Out of the Ghetto Blues."  If more of the tracks had the sound of the title track, this would be a five-star album, in my opinion.  True, Scott-Heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album, but not in the form I had hoped for.  I would take the Last Poets' album "This Is Madness" over this particular Scott-Heron album
This was just to much country for this parrothead. I liked one song, Piece of Work and that was about it
I gave this a good listen, but did not find it all that funny ... or memorable
Nothing like EON. EON is the one. This was a hack sequel with no guts. Very dissapointing
I went into this a pretty big Golden Smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys.  With Tweedy's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with Louris' departure from the Jayhawks, I was hoping we'd see a few more Tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since Louris' "Rainy Day Music" was released.Now, while there are some really good songs here, nothing really comes close to the "Red-Headed Stepchilds," "Radio Kings," or "Jennifer Save Mes."  The album lacks something but I can't put my finger on it.  It almost sounds like a band that has too MUCH focus.  Considering Golden Smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around, drinking beer, and goofing off, this album feels wrong.  It doesn't have that sing-along feel (with the exception of possibly one or two songs) that the first couple albums (and even EP) had.Just a little lackluster and, considering the amount of Louris has his hand in on this one, almost comes off as an album of Jayhawks throw-aways
I was unable to play in my car CD player, soonly choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player.
This album is not very good. I am a big fan of Life in General, At the show, and Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo but this sucks. I listened to it for about 2 weeks and then it cracked my backpack on a road trip. But I didn't care, becuase it sucked. It was boring, and it had no flavor. Not the Mxpx I used to know
Let's get one thing straight - Radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the Beatles.  That said, this is not the album for that reason.  Do not let this album turn you off from Radiohead...beacause it is truly not what they are about.  There is one hint though in where Radiohead will go.  In the song "Creep", which is not a fantastic song, there is a brilliant "CHU-CHUNK" made by Johnny Greenwood.   SO PLEASE - IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO RADIOHEAD...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  For the "rockers" - get THE BENDS, for people trying to expand their musical mind - get OK COMPUTER, and if you like that you may become obsessed with KID A.  There are some unbelievable songs on AMNESIAC, but it is not their most cohesive album, and HAIL TO THE THEIF is very solid.  Thank you for your time
Boo-Wop? haha ok, anyways I bought his through Middle-Piller distro. and it's got a couple of o.k. songs on it. The problem is the singing and the overall production. This is definetely a home-recording on computer deal. The vocals are waaaaay weak. What exactly is a "re-worked" debut album??? I thought once an album was out it was done, set in stone? Apparently not,so mister monster gets to pull a Blitzkid (who changed their first album cover years after it came out!) and take the cheezy way out. A definete step up from bands like Blitzkid,but still in the cellar of rock n roll. Do yourself a favor and buy some good old deathrock from the golden years
I like Jennifer Lopez, but I am not a fan of J.LO...let me explain. Jennifer started her career in the mid 90s, did some promising work (Selena / Out of Sight / The Cell / Blood and Wine / etc.), and a very well done debut album for an actor (On the 6). Everything was genuinely promising. UNFORTUNATELY, once "J.LO" was born (circa 2001), her endeavours got weak, too commercial for the sake of money, too fixed only to hype her up, not all that original nor different than anyone else, to truly stand out. "Rebirth" is an example of that. When I heard Get Right for the first time, I loved it, I thought it was catchy. It harkened the days of On the 6..that sassy, groovy, R-n-B vibe she had. Then I caught Step into my world, the only real R-n-B track on the album and thought, I'm feelin' it, definitely a favorite to this day. The the rest came along (3-11) and I thought, Sony  J.LO made this for the sake of money, due to her films doing poorly, hence she had time off to commit to recording a new album. I thought it was a very obviously fake attempt to compensate. I think she is a great performer, a very talented person, but I honestly don't feel this album makes her an artist, merely a reworking of herself musically.I rank it 3rd in her album line...On the 6 (4 stars)J.LO (3 stars)Rebirth (2 stars)This is me...then (2 stars)
perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations, but i was really disappointed with this recordthe songwriting is weak, the singing is weak, and the arrangements are dull something kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same, but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly, you can sing most of them after one listen, they are so simplistic and cliched
Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original.Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya
Their basically what would happen if you took P.O.D's lyrics, and then added boring 1 chord riffs repeated throughout the whole song followed by the singer screaming the top of his head off about God and self-loathing in a noise-bleed inducing pre-pubescent girl voice, so you have a band so bad it makes God himself want to commit suicide. The song titles are also annoyingly bad, obviously made so they sound artistically genius (but instead monotonous). And to everyone who thinks these guys are metal, they deserve to be buried alive. Metal is Fear Factory, Lamb of God, In Flames, and Arch Enemy. These guys are about as metal as Maroon 5.
one word.  generic.  terrible.  boring. (well, they are all one word)  people must learn to have a better taste in music.  granted there is at least one good song.  a few others are decent, but only because there are no vocals.  if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years, you have heard pulse ultra.  my friend likes breaking binjaman (another uber generic rock band in my book) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said "thats enough".  do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD cd.  when will people learn!
JUST LIKE IN MY OTHER REVIEW I CAN'T FIGURE OUT  THE MADNESS OVER THESE GUYS. I WILL ASK IN THIS POST AS WELL FOR SOMEBODY TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THEY SHOULD BE HEARD AND ARE RELEVANT IN A CREATIVE WAY. HONESTLY PEOPLE YOU CAN'T CALL THESE GUYS ARTISTS. AN ARTIST CREATES SOMETHING FROM A IDEA OR TWO THESE GUYS TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND JUST LUMP THEM TOGETHER. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. AND TO TOP IT OF THEY DON'T HAVE THE CHOPS AS MUSICIANS TO BE RELEVANT IN THAT FORM EITHER. A COMMENT LIKE "THEY ROCK" OR "THE LEAD SINGER IS SOOOO HOT" AREN'T EXAMPLES OF A GREAT ARTIST OR BAND. FROM THE DATES OF THE LAST POST MY WORDS MIGHT BE IN VAIN, KIND OF LIKE THE VALIDITY OF THIS RECORD. BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN A POST ON HERE FOR TWO YEARS. IF A FAN OF BANKING BENJAMINS DOES STUMBLE UPON THIS POST I INVITE YOU TO CHECK OUT MY OTHER REVIEWS, AND CHECKOUT SOME RELEVANT AND GREAT MUSIC
This is the 4th worse song to be put out in 2006. Seriously, this is awful. Very juvenile and materialistic. This guy and his rented chains need to disapear. What a waste
...when you're gearing up for suicide. This whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who's going to just end it all. I found myself suffering nightmares, fatigue, misery and paranoia. My ears unclogged but I started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. This is not a good album for the stressed, because it will just make you feel worse. I find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable. When I first listened to it it sounded inaccessable, after listening to it more and more I started to get more "into" it, but I can't say I found it a good place to be in. It's a somewhat interesting album, but it mostly just dragged me down, made me nervous, numb and hurt my head. People say this is great music. Let them say what they want. Give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that doesn't make a pest of itself. Kid A is just ok to me, and hasn't been worth all the effort to "get into". This almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners. I don't know, maybe I'm missing something, but to hear some "weird" music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears, try "Passengers" by U2.And Thom York sings like a Muppet on this album.  By the way I've enjoyed Radiohead's first three albums quite a bit (including Pablo Honey -- why are people always busting its chops).
I won't go into a long diatribe. Suffice it to say that when I listened to this upon its release earlier this year, I was disappointed. I gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great. This is more a photo of dylan as a free-spirit. There's a point where baez messes up a song. (i don't have anything against baez. that being said, i don't have much FOR her either.) There's joking and laughing, but really, I don't need a double-disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he'd rather be in the audience than performing. You can almost sense WHY dylan went electric in this concert.The bootlegs prior to this are superior and I would suggest that if you aren't a die-hard dylan fan to stick with them. If you really like dylan's acoustic work and not his electric stuff, you should be pleased with this double-disc.I love dylan, but not enough to enjoy this over and over again. I'll go to disk one of the 4th bootleg for my acoustic fix
Yep, this cd sucks. That Depeche Mode guy is really random, what makes you think anyone who is looking at the punk-o-rama review would be interested in Depeche Mode? REM sucks too, Michael Stipe is the most self absorbed old bald guy ever.
Maan, ima venda spenda of dis shizzi hur but fur shur, iz hord cor poor. I meanz what I be sayin is I be buyin all the hip s*** but when i play dis on ma player my mind be hurtin, in da bad way. So fow sho, to all da playaz out thay stay clean of this bad crack, itll hurt yow mind and yow poket. Fur shur dis is da Flippa, keep it clean boyz (yea, you punks now what I be sayin
HEY!NEVER LIKED JA FOOL!HE IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE OVER!WHERE IS HE???????LIKE I CARE!ANY WAY!!!!50 HAS SOLD 16 MILLION+ CD'SAND JA FOOL HAD THE NERVE TO SAY 50 DON'T SELL!!HA!!!!!!JA FOOL!!!GREATEST HITS!!!!!!!!!!NUFF SAID!OVER JA FOOL RULE!!
There's nothing in this I'd say even remotely resembles jazz. It's repetitive, has a rock beat, and consists mostly of licks taken from other players. If you're looking for backrgound music to play in a waiting room, this might be a good choice
Crikey!!!! What is this chunder? Wait a minute....art students from "Down Under" get together and make fun little songs while watching reruns of "The Wiggles", decide they can market these tunes to an adoring fan base! Yeah, this stuff could be the soundtrack to "Forrest Gump" alright. "Run, Forrest, run! Run as fast as you can from this crap!!!" And these guys are touring, too? Are they touring with Barney  Friends?There is not one thing of value to this other than that the CD itself makes a handy coaster for your Foster's..
The most untalented producer in the business. Honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with Biggie and Black rob's only one hit. The rest of this is trash. Especially those chickenheads Total. And once again Puff tryin to eat off Biggie carcass. Dont give this bum anymore money, Just listen to Biggies two gems and "f" the rest
LOL! Some people cant be serious these days. The lyrics on every track are straight garbage. So he failed BAD lyric wise. Production wise, some of the beats are pretty good, but a beat doesnt make a song good! Nor does it make horrible lyrics good!! So I think some tracks where he gets deep are worth the try J-Kwon, but the game aint for you. I think this album is garbage
This album is one of the only live albums that I don't have. I have heard samples, and a few extra songs on other cds though. The first thing I hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that Stevie couldn't have been more high. His performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group (specifically Reese Wynans). Most poeple don't know this but, on the old vinyl copy of this album, (I've never heard it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. It was the song that usually comes close to the end of Stevie's sets. The song was Life Without You. Since it was the very last song, I'm guessing Stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything. Being high is one thing, but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible. In the old vinyl disc, Stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that Reese Wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted. This track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness
History has a way of making the radical seem conservative, and certainly within the context of Cecil Taylor's music, his debut album, "Jazz Advance" is rather conservative.  Taylor, known for his relentless, dense music, did not emerge fully formed (although even at this early date, his music is far removed from his hard bop contemporaries), but developed over time.  For those of us who enjoy Taylor's music, this record is a historical curiosity, for anyone else, its either going to sound as one permutation further from the early Ornette Coleman idiom (indeed, this music is far closer to Coleman's sound than anything Taylor would be doing in the '60s or later).  My understanding is that when this was first released, it raised quite a stir.  Its a bit difficult to see why.Taylor is largely melodic-- performing pieces with coherent themes-- his experimentations seem to be in the use of block chords, odd inversions, and in soloing underneath the primary voice at this point.  The record is four originals and four standards, and as one would suspect, Taylor largely breathes on his own compositions.  He is backed by nearly inaudible bassist Buell Neidlinger and drummer Dennis Charles, with soprano sax player Steve Lacy on two tracks.  Neidlinger and Charles are far closer in the hard bop idiom-- their performances swing, Charles in particular is playing way inside hard bop.  This puts them a bit at odds with Taylor, who, while he gives more space than he would on his later work, is still more of a neoclassical improvising pianist than a jazz pianist.  When Lacy plays, Taylor's form of comping doesn't seem fully formed, or Lacy doesn't seem quite prepared to play inside Taylor's environment, and as a result he sounds somewhat detached from the pianist.The sounds of the future can clearly be heard on several tracks, "Bemsha Swing" features many of Taylor's clustered chords and runs, solo piano take on "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" presents the theme in a barely recognizable fashion and is as close to his future organized chaos as he'd get, and while original "Rick Kick Shaw" is far away from where he'd end up, its the first sign of the short of aggression that Taylor would harness in the future.  The music is enjoyable enough, but Taylor would reach such heights that its hard to not listen to this without comparing it to his future works.  The other complaint is the sound-- this issue is from 1991 and is in desparate need of remastering.In the end, this is an album of historical value.  If you're looking for an introduction to Taylor's music and aren't ready to dive head first into his methods, try "Looking Ahead!", its a far superior album by which point Neidlinger and Charles (who reprise their roles) were far more closely integrated with Taylor's music
Very disappointing - Nothing like Riverdance  Would not recommend and I am avid fa
Bad news is that I wasted my time listening to this whinefest.Good news is that I bought it used.I give it two stars because there are two tolerable songs on the CD and she is a cutie.More good news. I re-sold it for my purchase price
I heard stories about Michelle Branch before trying out her music. And i was electrified to find out that there is still a young, honest and rock-ish female artist out there working her way up.First off all, i'd like to say i wish to remain objective to all other listeners' opinion, so yup...criticism is welcomed.I'd like to let people know what kind of a viewer is writing this particular review too.Basically, my main influences are Bon Jovi, the Goo Goo Dolls and ELO. I'm a 17-year-old male.Hotel Paper is one big step for michelle. She evidentally matured her music between "Spirit Room" and this.Michelle is pretty much at the state where she can't really make big steps on her own. And that's why i think her authorities are limiting her potentials by pushing her to mainstream. Like the fact that she wrote so many catchy, boring and good-to-sell singles that won't last and are only appealing to listerners on the shallow side.Although some of her songs made me perfectly convinced that she CAN write decent music.(Tuesday Morning, Drop in the Ocean, Hotel Paper)Some peeps are saying how Michelle isn't quite a super songwriter nor a guitarist. I agree.IMO, many of her riffs are boring and unoriginal. Even a noob guitarist like me could tell. But afterall, it's pop, so that's inevitable. But she could do MUCH MUCH better than that.Her lyrics are ok since she doesn't write no emo nor punk junk, but a lot of complaining and childish relationships. Most are ok though.What i'm saying is, she most definetly has her own style...but sadly, it's surpressed at an extent where it's irritating and  makes me feel like killing those studio dudes that are spending way too much time laying their hands on Michelle's music.Nevertheless, just because Michelle is young and writes her own songs and plays the "guitar", doesn't mean you gotta try her music out. But sadly, that's exactly how a lot of people out there got attracted. I believe it's more about how you like the music.I can't stress the fact that michelle is a musician with great potential and future. But to me, it seems like she's throwing those away for popularity. One good example is, as prolly you've already heard...the posing for a men's magazine named M----. Whatever she was thinking, it really crushed my impressions on michelle...the cute musical lady she used to be....And the terrible decision of forming a pseudo-country rock band with her friend.Michelle IS talented and hella good compared to the other you-know-who female artists, but let's get real here...she has a long way to go. She most certainly is capable of going far and i really do hope one day i'll be listening to her matured and true music. Afterall, IMO, it's only the matter of time before she surpasses Amanda Marshall on my list.I really hope michelle could get out of this situation and unchain from this game the studio peeps are playing on her and make every song and every note the way she always wants to."Tuesday Morning" 3.5/5"Hotel Paper" 4/5The rest are just mediocre
Following 2002's self-produced and underrated Under Rug Swept, Morissette returns in 2004 with So-Called Chaos. With this release, Morissette has done a complete makeover of her look with a serious haircut and sporting a look of casual glamour like she's aspiring to take Hollywood by strom but isn't 100% sure. Maybe the new look and image might have worked if Morissette's makeover in sound was good enough to go with it-but it's not. This CD starts out good with the opening cut "Eight Easy Steps," a fast-paced rockin' tune with Alanis at the wheel of leadership but also ready to bust her own chops at the same moment. "Out is Through" follows and also stands out, but then So-Called Chaos begins to turn problematic by not having an edge. And Morissette should never have brought John Shanks or Tim Thorney(or both)on board for assistance because she was left with bland arrangements behind many of the tracks. "Doth I Protest Too Much" is without a doubt the worst song Alanis has ever recorded. The title song attempts for a gritty and gutsy feel but even that attempt becomes overshadowed by Morissette's lyrics(yes, not her best work)when she refers to heartburn, headaches, and breached contracts as primary results of a chaotic lifestyle. The tracks continue with "All of Me," and "This Grudge," both rather dull, while the closing track "Everything" was a weak choice for the first single. Morissette has always been a progressive artist, but So-Called Chaos doesn't measure up to any of its predecessors, and may leave many fans longing to see the girl with the jagged heart still spinning with her free-flowing locks firmly in place.
Quality is poor. Some songs are not playing. Avoid buying @Amazon
This is the cheesiest music ever. Phil Collins, Glenn Frey, Chaka Khan? Are you kidding me? These were the worst artists of the 80's. Where's U2, REM, the Pixies, X, the Pretenders, Tom Petty, Prince, Springsteen, the Replacements, Husker Du? Does anyone like Rock and Roll? Phil Collins writes songs for Disney and Pixar now! What did Glenn Frey know about 'Smugglers Blues'? Do you think he was writing from the experience or from the heart? These are the worst artists, songwriters and performers of the 80's.  Enjoy the nostalgia, but the art which is song is seriously missing on this CD. 
We all know how great the songs are on this CD -- 5-Star all the way.However, I guess there's an unlucky few oddballs among us who can't play the SACD hybrid CD format of this particular reissue on our PC.  Which also means that we can't add the CD to our iTunes or iPod music selections.  In this day and age, that's severely limiting, so I regret this purchase (I don't have some jalopy of a PC/processor either, as my computer is less than seven months old, with 2GB of RAM).I don't know who to blame for my "mistake" -- myself?  Amazon?  Sony?  Philips?  ABKCO?I'll blame myself and be more careful next time -- in part by avoiding "DSD-" or "SACD-" labeled items.I'll also give the CD 1 Star on the basis of its limited technological usefulness to me
Just saw the video for this while flicking. The song talks about london bridge going down and everything but the bridge is fixed, it doesn't go up or down with the video showing tower bridge. So bit of a mix up there.Petty maybe but just thought it should be pointed out
I was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the 80s. Unfortunately, instead of picking up on the latest influence of 80s music in dance music, what we get here is predominantly disco flavored tracks that sound painfully dated, with some Latin tones now and then. The only semi retro/electro tracks on here (and my favorites) are Feel For You, Love Bite, Your Love is Like a Drug, and Marc Almond's remix of Venus. The two lead singles "Move in My Direction" and "Look on the Floor" are not even the strongest tracks! And the remixes on their singles don't make them much better. I appreciate the commercial direction the girls have taken, but you can still sound mainstream while being more sophisticated than this. Take a listen to the new Madonna or even the Kelly Osbourne(!) to hear some infectious melodies with an 80s flair that don't melt down into total cheese. Unfortunately, I just don't see US radio embracing any of the sounds on this disc. But of course, fans of Bananarama should still add this one to their collection. It's listenable, if not up to today's standards
I hate saying this as a HUGE Good Charlotte fan but their new album is just a major waste of money. Their first album is one of my top five albums of all time, but this one sucks. The songs are all dance pop synthesized junk. No real guitars, no messages to any of the songs, no nothing. I dont know if Joel is just too busy running around town with Nicole Richie or what but they skipped out on this album. The only redeaming song is The River, on which they colaberated with M Shadows and Synester Gates of Avenged Sevenfold. I hate hate hate to say it but dont waste your money or time on this one, just listen to the first album and remember what a great band they used to be.
This album is a real let down and it pains me to say so, since I really do like the KOL. The first 2 cds were catchy and they rocked. I didn't care if they were singing about groupie sex or street brawling. It didn't matter because the songs were great.But on this cd they've opted for an experimental sound that doesn't measure up. Innovative is one thing but that shrill screech in Charmer-what the heck is up with that? How often do you want to listen to it? Once was enough for me. I wasn't expecting the Pixies here. And then there's the reverb employed on song after song-why? It just degenerates into white noise. There are a couple of good tracks on the dics- Black Thumbnail, for one. But then there are throwaway tunes like Camaro, which is about as clique as you can get. That said, art is subjective, and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews. But I find most of it unlistenable.I can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating; this is definitely not one of them
I was so disappointed with this CD.  At least 6 of the songs were recorded from VERY OLD albums....scratches and all!  They were SO bad. I play two of the songs over and over...the only two I liked. When I read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs, I assumed that they meant doubles of the same song....I was wrong. I don't know WHY they had to add the scratchy music..a filler?  I would quickly skip to another song...only to have to "skip" many times!
I bought this in a haze of holiday optimism, having heard Ms. Aguilera knock my socks off dueting with Tony Bennett on a television tribute show.  There is no denying that the girl can sing.  Unfortunately, what she sings here is banal at best, and downright irritating at worst--lots of gratuitous squealing.  It's a real shame to see a talent like hers drowned by the tide of pop mediocrity.  I reluctantly gave this two stars rather than one in recognition of my age.  Maybe I just don't get it.  Then again, maybe it's just not there for me to get
Bill Charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented, lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today.  He has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences.  That told, I find it very hard to give his latest effort, Stardust, more than two stars.  With very few exceptions, I found this CD to be fairly self-indulgent and Charlap rather morose in his intrepretations. It wasn't nearly a refeshing to the ear as Written in the Stars.  I would recommend this for a Charlap devotee but no one else.  He has made better albums
she is not a singer, she is not able to write, play and read the scores/Music. She is an entertainer! The problem is: you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years? it is the same case like britney spears and spice girls! PS: pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos!!! Thank god for america's future pop artists like this one!
After Norah's first two CDs and the Little Willie's CD I was greatly looking forward to this release.  To say the least I am disappointed.  I was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep.  Where is the range of work?  All of the songs on this CD sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because of Norah's angelic voice, otherwise I'd have to give this one a 1 star rating
This great underground master DJ deservedly gets a release on a major record label... but there are too many rappers, not enough personality in the production, and obvious restraint in the sampling (surely the result of copyright clearance issues.) Compared to Z-Trip's amazing and audacious Uneasy Listening with DJ-P and Live at the Future Primitive with Radar, this is just a bore... yawn...
I hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful "supergroups".  Can't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more?  There's no such thing as a good supergroup.  The Supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $uck.When Damn Yankees released their 1990 debut, every song on it was so incredibly generic, there was no hope for this band.  The whole album seemed rushed and thrown together.  They had nothing meaningful to say with these songs, it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their "supergroup" scam.  The big, booming, arena rock choruses just ring hollow.  I guess they're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks, but to me, it just sounds like a lot of filler.Supergroups will always suck, because they diliberately try to sound bad!  Thats right people!  Supergroup members know that since they're already popular, the album they're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller----"Why bother trying to come up with good songs?  We're already popular, so people will buy it no matter how bad it is! Lets just put out filler."  Supergroups are a TOTAL farce, its just easy money for the people involved, and nothing more.  If you buy ANY album by ANY supergroup, than you my friend, are a sucker!If you want to hear Shaw or Blades at their best, just keep listening to any Styx or Night Ranger album, and avoid anything by Damn Yankees, or any other supergroup
The title says it all. They could have put a better group of songs togather
I bought this CD after having seen Ken Burns' special on PBS. The energy that came through on screen in the Benny Goodman segments doesn't really come through in this CD. Artie Shaw said that Benny Goodman was too much of a perfectionist to take risks and so his music languished in predictability. That shows in this collection. Afterall, where would Jazz be if Jazz musicians didn't take risks
I heard that song recently Three Strange Days...and I recalled how much I detested it when it came out.  Overt pandering to tyros in altered states.  Now I can't get it out of my head, and may require a lobotomy.  There was a lot of interesting stuff that came out in '91; but this wasn't part of that canon.  Nice try School of Fish.  Have fun playing the CYO circuit
I LOVED Shedaisy's first album The Whole Shebang.  And I also really enjoy their Christmas albumn.  They have beautiful voices and I love the three part harmonies they come up with.  I was very excited to get their newest album but I was sure dissapointed.  This is a very dark and depressing album.  Almost every song is about lost love.  Also, all the songs but 1 are slow.  Where is the upbeat Shedaisy I fell in love with???  I would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to The Whole Shebang again.  Still, I look forward to what the future may bring from them.  These sisters have alot of talent
Most of these songs were previously sold on other albums from Martina. What a waste of money to buy this album of Mostly "old" songs and only a few new ones! Martina is sucking money out of the pockets of hard-working individuals. Maybe she should try getting a REAL job instead of using the average working person to support her lavish  luxurious lifestyle. Many of us are living in trailer parks  working 80 hours a week while Martina sitting on her a** in her million dollar house making money like rain! You, the people who are buying her albums are making her rich...what the hell is wrong with you people? Don't buy her albums and let her get a freakin' job so she can feel what it's like to work every day and actually earn a damn dollar! Martina, quit using poor people to accommodate your ridiculously high lifestyle
 This was o.k. Nothing more nothing less. This album was hard to review, beacuse no songs really stick out. I mean the guy is a mediocre artist with mediocre rhymes, laced over just above mediocre beats. I have heard better Sesame Street singalongs for yappy kids in the back seat of a mini van.  I mean what does the album have that sticks out? "Saturday To Saturday"? "Bloody Horseshoe"? Or the multi- faceted "Boo, We Ain't Forgot About You" None of the above, or none on the album.Sorry. And please, all angry people who think that this is a bad review, remember, it's a REVIEW. I can say what I want
Though these are the songs that make the Mills Brothers famous, they are not the original recordings that made these songs famous, and not necessarily sung by the same men that sang the originals (certainly they are considerably older).  These are OK, but they lack the punch and familiarity (to a fan like myself) of the originals.  The title, though not actually misleading, leads one to believe you will be listening to the original songs--they are not.  I recommend only if you must have the complete set of mills Brothers records
Me especially I cannot hate on Cam cuz I got his first albums and thats when he was serious lyrically. Either the money went to his head or he just ran outta s*** to say. And judgin that his subject matter stays the same I guesss its true. Dude spits some retarded a** lyrics. I give this CD a two cuz of the beats. But this dude is a certified beatwaster. These producers need to give these beats to rappers who can actually spit bars. This n***a sumtimes don't even rhyme
Do not buy this CD.  He is definitely wack. His silly rhyme style and dull voice sounds lethargic over uninspired beats. As a member of "Children of the Corn" he was weak and he still is weak.  The other member of his Dip-Set Crew outshine him on his own CD...how lame is that.  Through away any Cam'ron cd's you own and immediately replace them with music by Jay-Z. 
When the preview aired, I was pushing the movie to all my friends, based on the hilarity of the preview. At that time, I skeptically said, "I hope these don't turn out to be the only funny parts." and that was exactly what happened. The rest of the movie was full over overdone gross jokes, crass humor that went way over the line and kept running. The pee joke was funny once, but even at that one time they overdid it, then overdid it again, and then again. The Harry Potter parts were hilarious! Jack Sparrow was awesome! But I wished I had not been forced to watch the rest of the crap just to see a few funny parts of the movie. It's another Scary Movie (1) deal, only worse! I love the newest Scary Movies, they are funny, but 1 really sucked. It was funny now and then, but a lot of it was stupid. So is Epic Movie, only worse. Don't waste your money buying it. Rent and fast forward.
It has been nearly three months and I have yet to receive the subject Michael Henderson CD.  Amazon should not be offering this item for sale, if they do not have access to a supplier
SO this is the winner of PLOP idol from the U.K then.  Well they don't come prettier than this from Scotland I guess, that's for sure.  As far as the music is concerned, AVOID!  It's nothing but a calchony of crap.  Perhaps Michelle should stick at something she is good at - eating chips and mars bars
Don`t waste your time and money on this compilation.  What a cheap shot to take the consumers money.  Read the very fine print, it does have a disclaimer but you really have to look for it.  Shame on the distributor!
Eric Reed is a monster pianist. Under the right circumstances, he could record a Christmas album that would become an instant classic. This, however, is an unfortunate example of what happens when an overconfident artist tries to do everything himself.Reed produced and arranged this album himself. Probably if he had hired an objective producer, that producer would have told him to hire an arranger. Reed's arrangements are second-rate. His version of "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" has been downshifted into a parody that serves as the worst example of an annoying trend: Reed attempts to put a fresh twist on nearly every song. It's an admirable goal, but he doesn't have what it takes; and the result is like a restaurant that serves hamburgers with a knife and fork, and swordfish crumbled over salad. It just doesn't work.I hope this isn't the last Christmas album from Eric Reed. He's one of the truly original voices of his generation; and with his gospel background and feel for the blues, there's no doubt in my mind he could record an album that would rival "A Charlie Brown Christmas." But this isn't it. He needs to hand over the reins of his next project and focus on the piano
First off that has to be the worst rhyme I've ever heard in my life...  Andre Nickatina (in the rapping world) is one of the worst i've ever heard, but if you're into dope beats and his style in flowing with them (reminds me of someone on the ocean just being carried by waves, paddling every which way to stay with them), and what i mean by that is he tries to keep up with the pace and the beat and says (what feels like) every single thing that pops into his head from coke to what he had for dinner that night.  But overall, "if you can't dig it like its shovelled man i guess you ain't able" summs this and the rest of the Nickatina c.d.s up
When Mike  The Mechanics ushered in the `Madchester' scene with The Living Years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon. If you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads!Verdict: don't waste your money.
Carlos Mencia is one edgy comedian; I know this because he won't stop telling everyone about it. I've never been a huge fan of Carlos and after listening to this CD my opinion of him hasn't really changed. He claims to be an edgy comedian and that's his problem, if he was truly edgy he wouldn't have to constantly remind us in his CD/DVD titles, his show on Comedy Central, radio/TV interviews and most importantly during his own act. Sure he talks about very racial and socially taboo subjects but so does Chris Rock, George Lopez, David Cross, George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Richard Pryor (RIP) and countless other comedians and they are much better at it. In fact they are so good at it Mr. Mencia often feels to need to use some of these comedian's jokes in his own act, a true sign of respect for those who came before them; at least that's what Carlos seems to think or maybe he's just plagiarizing because he's not funny enough to come up with descent material. Needless to say I was not laughing while listening to this CD and it wasn't because I find Carlos to mean spirited, or crass, or politically incorrect; it's because everything he talks about that's supposed to be so gosh darn edgy has already been said by other people who are much more funny then he is. There is so much good stand up comedy out there people don't waste your time and money on this joke stealing, self aggrandizing hack. 
I listened to this cd and unless you are into the whole barking dog sound of a band I didn't like this one, one bit, but than again it was also for my husband. I definitely would not recommend unless you have heard of the band and like that style of music
I was really excited when I received Tone Poems III as a gift. Wow, Grisman and Brozman! Two amazing fret men playing some wonderful vintage instruments. I couldn't wait to hear some excellent acoustic bluesy slide and Reso music. Unfortunately, this recording comes across like sugar poured on the tongue. If you like sitting around in beach wear and listening to Hawaiian strumming-which is at least half of it-this is the recording for you. (In fairness, track 15, "Style O Blues," and track 20, "New Steal," are wonderful. They have some drive and get-up-and-go.)    I also own Tone Poems I, which Grisman did with flatpicker extraodinaire Tony Rice. That recording is also mostly a lightweight.     I play mandolin and fiddle, and recognize David Grisman as the world's master with the mando. I also appreciate what he's doing with his Acoustic Disc recording label. These days, however, he seems to be better off when other musicians are running the show. The recent recordings with Vasser Clements and Old and in the Gray are great. "Hold On, We're Stummin'," with Sam Bush,is the best new mandolin record I've heard. Buy it and go to acoustic heaven!    For my hard-earned money, however, the Tone Poems CDs have turned out to be an expensive set of matching drink coasters. I just know that musicians of this caliber, playing instruments of this quality, could have given us a better selection of music.
Of the dozen tracks featured here, chances are the typical listener will only recognize four: Signs, Sweet City Woman, One Fine Morning and Gimme Dat Ding - and the last-named is out of sequence, having come out more than a year before the others.  The star of this show is Lighthouse's One Fine Morning, and Rhino must be praised for offering up the full (LP) version rather than the 45-rpm edit, which was about two minutes shorter.  It's a shame, in a way, that this song had lyrics; had it been an instrumental, it would have found a perfect and permanent home - on Music From NFL Films - it had that quality about it.  As for the other eight offerings: If they wanted to pick some obscure stuff, why didn't they go all the way and throw in Dusk's Treat Me Like A Good Piece Of Candy?
This Is as Bad as The Film.in Fact Just Like The FIlm The Soundtrack is the same old Formula.WillHis MoviesMusic Never change the same Old Beat.The Rest Of The Soundtrack is just as  bad.UNORIGINALBORING.What A Waste of KOOL MOE DEE
Disappointing to see a man of Garbarek's gifts drift inexorably towards artistic middle-age and the lure of MOR classical and soft world-beat markets. No one expects him to do a 'jazz' album nowadays but after a six-year recording hiatus we might have expected some innovation and sharpness in the settings he chooses. Sadly,the evidence on this release is of an artist who's content to mine the same musical territory for about 15 years now to the point of exhaustion; theres nothing here he hasn't said better on his previous three or four outings. All is not lost though, and there are moments of stark beauty here and there but they are mostly lost in a soft sticky morass of Garbarek cliches and the kind of uninspired composition better suited to a film soundtrack or TV documentary about some beautiful natural environment. Forget the misleading hype elsewhere and get hold of just about any of his albums from about 1972 through to 1987 and I guarantee you'll feel better for it
this is no SAW 85-92 as some people compare it to. Oh, no. This is a largely unfulfilling listen. The tracks all sound too similar. I realize Richard's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear, but the drum programming and harmonic "development" is lackluster. Only track worth burping over is the last one... XMD something. Has he been taking piano lessons since Druqks? For those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch, check out Nick Forte's new release "young man's disease" which is better than anything else i've heard this year.
In the classic and disturbing 1972 movie Deliverance, Lewis (Burt Reynolds) gives this ominous warning to Ed (Jon Voigt): "Machines are going to fail. Systems are going to fail. Then... survival."What, I wonder, will Richard D. James (a.k.a. Aphex Twin, a.k.a. AFX) do when the machines fail?It's been nearly five years since his underappreciated album drukqs, where we got a tantalizing possible answer to this question: the plaintive, lovely, Satie-esque acoustic keyboard nocturnes intermingled among the abstract, frantic electronic soundscapes throughout its sprawling duration. [Another intriguing solution was proposed on the album Acoustica: Alarm Will Sound performs Aphex Twin...]Chosen Lords, RDJ's first proper CD release since then, is actually a collection of various tracks from his "Analord series" of overpriced, elaborately packaged 12-inch vinyl singles that he's been cranking out over the last year or so. Those who were put off by the excesses and overt eccentricity of drukqs may hail these cryptically titled, drum-machine laden compositions as a "return to greatness." Indeed, AFX is certainly reviving a more compact, accessible (for him), and straightforward style here, with comparatively regular (though not quite danceable) rhythms and those comforting underlying simple synthesizer melodies.I have to say, though, that there's a disappointing and somewhat melancholy sense here of a great musical mind spinning its wheels. By returning to such familiar ground he seems to be setting up systems and letting them run their course in an almost cynical way, without any of the maniacal glee that was once part of his singular musical personality on unforgettable releases like Come To Daddy, Windowlicker, The Richard D. James Album, and, yes -- drukqs. Notably lacking are the voices that once regularly appeared in his productions -- true, they were usually rather unsettling, distorted, and manipulated voices, but at least they added some welcome humanity. Also missing are those rare but beautiful moments of repose (ballads?) such as "Flim," "Nannou" and the striking piano interludes on drukqs.In the end, Chosen Lords, while an undeniably interesting and expertly produced collection of electronic music, is nonetheless a sterile, static, joyless affair. If it inspires any emotion at all, it will probably be pity and sadness as you listen to a possible musical genius coasting along without exploring any new directions for the first time in his otherwise remarkable career.Yes, I'm afraid the machines have failed Richard D. James, and I sincerely hope he can survive in this cold and remote musical wilderness of his own creation..
Nothing even close to "say no More" I'm sorry I spent the mone
This a great priced cd, but the content is why it is so cheap. It's a true-amateur album. Beethoven Lover is over her/his head. This is the real world, not a fantasy-everyone-likes-every-type-of-music world. Deal with it and agree with me. It isn't so great
Blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit = Elefant's lyrics.  I personally like Interpol and the Strokes; I resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs
The restoration of a Vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture. Nonetheless, Motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as D'ira e Furor Armato, La Figlia Lo Sposo, Gl'otraggi della Sorte, D'ove La Figlia?, S'impugni La Spada, and performances by Vito Priante, Inga Kalna, and Marijana Mijanovic. Bravo for Vito Priante and his interpretation of GI'otraggi della Sorte, and D'ove la Figlia. He does a great ornamentation in the da capos, and turns up the volume in all the right notes. Just like "Terribile lo Sento", and "Orribile lo Scempio", "GI'otraggi" shares the same musicalization. Somehow, this version of the score is especially more dramatic and  subtlely more melodic. 
I agree fully with A music fan above ... this and David's self titled album are really poor in comparison to the rest of his solo work. I love most of Talking Heads music but don't rate Remain in Light highly like most fans do
Who could like a band like The Rolling Stones? They are not the world's greatest rock band and they never made anything good but Start Me Up and Shattered. Their new album is the most horrible CD I have ever heard. Stay far away from that CD. Get anything from the Stones that contains Start Me Up or Shattered insted.
Yes yes we all know the mega hit When I See You Smile. But it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole.The band hits gear pretty early with Best of What I Got but after that it's pretty bad. How Possession ever became a hit I've not idea. Well, where I come from it didn't, but in the US this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits.The production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album. Neil Schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck. Besides, he probably wanted some revenge on Steve Perry so he really wanted to make some cash. Pity, listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man. Rockin' Horse for example. An interesting additin to the AOR landscape, and some of the music is lively. But when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just doesn't get my vote. Even my devoted AOR fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track (we all know which one).But hey, if AOR is your bag you could do a lot worse
let me first say this, Roots is basically Paul Simon's Graceland, except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america, cut a couple of terrible tracks with "natives"?, then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead Nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics, excessive "guesting" of other crappy artist, bad guitar, bad sitar(!), and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn, all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time, money, and matter. Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. A real bummer. 
Before you all dismiss me as an obsessive, close-minded thrash fanatic; I thoroughly enjoyed "Chaos AD," which was a Sep' album with the perfect balance of experimentation and death metal.I like the idea of experimenting with tribal sounds, but with those sounds, Max decided to throw in downtuned guitars, not doing guitar solos, excessive profanity, lame "I hate this I hate that" lyrics, and guest musicians.  The only decent songs on here are "Roots Bloody Roots" and "Dictators***;" everything else is awful.  This isn't Sepultura, this is Soulfly.I'm glad Max left because if he stayed in the band, Sep' would have degenerated into a nu-metal band.For good Sepultura albums, get these instead (starting with the best):SchizophreniaMorbid Visions/Bestial DevastationBeneath the RemainsAriseChaos ADDante XXINationRoorbackPS, you Max fanatics need to cut Derik Green some slack, he's keeping Sep' alive while Max is making an arse of himself with Soulfly
I ususally like Aguilera and I need a song to practice for dance so I bought this one for "No Other Man" figuring I would like the other songs as well.  I was so wrong. I hate the rest of them. 
This completely lacks the charm and subtlety of the original.  Overblown, overproduced Mackintosh garbage. If he could have found an excuse to land a helicopter on the stage, I'm sure he wouldn't have hesitated.  Mr. Banks has been turned into a one dimensional clown and his songs have all been changed for the worst. And the omission of "Sister Suffragettes" smacks of PC nonsense
Unfortunately I was EXTREMELY unhappy after listening to the album. Unlike many other Altan fans, I view Maireads singing as the weakest part of the groups appeal despite their having chosen some excellent songs over the course of their recording career. The problem is that on this album they emphasize her singing to the almost total exclusion of their  instrumentals which was what attracted me to the group in the first place. And the few instrumentals they do play are played with no spirit almost like well I guess we have to put a few instrumentals on kind of effort. I'm sorry, but she has a thin voice and is frequently shrill and off-key on many of their songs. She is however an excellent fiddler and that with the superb abilities of the other members and  inspired arrangements made them for me the top Irish folk group. Alas they have decided to stress her poor-to-mediocre vocals instead of their great abilities in playing reels, jigs, etc. I miss Frankie Kennedy's flute too. Goodbye Altan, your best day's are over unless you revert to the format of the old days
My DJ side:I actually had to stop the music, open the tray on the CD player then check whether I had the right CD1 down-tempo in, or some other CD that my wife played before as the music was so not what I was expecting, sounding more like Deep Forest than JVM. To my surprise, it was Jimmy's Balance 10. I decided to Keep an open mind and listen to it anyway. I went to sleep after the 4th track. The next day I decided to listen to the second CD (mid tempo). Again I stopped the music, opened the tray on the CD player then checked whether I had the (mid tempo CD) in instead of the down-tempo I was playing the night before. Sure enough, the (mid tempo) was what I had in the player, but did not sound much different than the lullabies I was listening to on CD1. When the mid-tempo was over, I thought to myself "well, this would be very nice for an upcoming relaxing dinner with friends". The next day I had high hopes for the up tempo CD, cause well, as the name implies, it should be where the beats and treats are. But No. Not really. The only reason I didn't freak out from listening to the 1st and 2nd CD of Jimmy Van M's Balance release is because for three days I kept telling myself that there is an up tempo CD. I didn't mind CD12 out of place pop tracks, I didn't mind the different types of music being played in sequence, or rather, out of sequence. I didn't mind hotel lobby music that reminded me of a hotel I stayed in two years ago in Vienna. All this will be forgivable when I hear the up-tempo, because I was so sure it's going to be awesome. Unfortunately, I was not quite right about my assumptions. Things did not start happening until track 5 (The Reducer 2), I don't really need some 4 tracks on the third CD to get me warmed up. Jimmy warmed me up for 37 tracks before that, in his down + mid-tempo crap. For the most part, this production of the Balance series - especially the first 41 tracks in sequence - churned out some of the most lethargic, way too slow and boring music that could be described, at best, as lullabies for grown ups. As for the last 9 tracks of the up-tempo, it is actually - dare I say - decent enough, but way too late, and even worse, ended prematurely. It should have been re-arranged with tracks in reverse order on every CD to be as follows: (CD3) up-tempo should have been (CD1) renamed (in the car from club to home), (CD2) mid-tempo should have been renamed (at home in the living room) and finally (CD1) down-tempo should have been (CD3) renamed (in your bedroom).  This just makes more sense.  The reason I say this is due to the disproportionate figures of dance tracks given to us (9) to the rest of the sleepy, mellow ones (41). For example, chill out house almost always start with a faster track or two then goes on to be slower gradually. I have never come across a chill CD that opened with 10 fast tracks and ended with 03 slow ones, that's not chill. JVM Balance did exactly that; took forever to ascend to a certain point, then crashed almost immediately. What gives?  Half star for CD1Half star for CD23 stars for CD3My human side:Dance music is not the only type of beautiful music out there, Duh!Jimmy made that very clear in this release. If you want to listen to a wide range of (not bad!) music, then Balance 10 is for you. Dive in JVM selection of what he thinks makes us human; expressions of the soul that goes beyond our daily necessities to survive. As a matter of fact, we don't even need music (or any type of arts for that matter) to survive at all. Still we listen to it, we crave it and for many people their livelihood depends on it. Music can represent our feelings, desires and wishes, and with JVM Deep Forest like music here (as I mentioned before) I can't help but wonder if he is going through a certain period in his life where spirituality and oneness with the world is a priority. I think it shows.
I bought this CD for the Avril Lavigne song Keep Holding On. I really like her song, and this is the only way I could find to buy get it. Was to buy the Eragon Sound track. I havent seen the movie. Besides that I wouldn't have bought it
In general I'm a big fan of movie music, but to tell the truth I expected more from this one. This soundtrack is incomaparable to say Lord of the Rings or Star Wars movie music. It lacks depth and emotion and power. Unlike emotionally potent melodies present in LOTR soundtrack the Eragon is pretty dull and uninteresting. I get the impression that the entire album is in fact a variation of a single theme called Eragon. I get the feeling that entire album has only one very long and boring track. I hope they'll make better album for the next movie of the Inheritence Trilogy.
It Might not be A good Album but it definitely shows Shania's potential
I loved her first album but this one is the same old same old rehashed time and time again she has reached her limits i'm afriad
Forget the fact that despite the grumbling about today's "music" too many people just swallow and digest the slop record companies throw at them, "Hollaback Girl" is the absolute DUMBEST "song" I've ever had the displeasure to hear.There are two main parts to this travesty: 1. Where she says "That's my sh**" no less than a million times, and 2. She demonstrates that she's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to spell bananas for the rest of us.If this is supposed to be rap, Stefani failed miserably.  If it's supposed to be dance, again, she failed miserably.  To be honest, I don't know what the hell this is supposed to be because it sure isn't music.  The fact that it was Number One for so long proves that perhaps people don't have any requirements for their ears.  - Donna Di Giacom
I know, I know - I never thought it possible either, that Gwen Stefani could produce something more awful than anything her (ex?) band No Doubt and reduced to house-husband Gavin Rosdale's band Bush ever could combined. Take No Doubt's attempts at reggae, their use of guitars and trumpets (together? Never good), take.. well, every Bush song ever recorded and "Hollaback Girl" is STILL a hundred times worse. Let's talk about WHY.First of all, that fake music thing I hate. If you've read any of my previous reviews (and if not, why not?) you'll know that if someone is singing something, even if they've written it or not, you've got to BELIEVE it. I mean, Aretha Franklin didn't write "Respect" (Otis Redding did), but when she sings it - you believe it. Not so with this, a laughable attempt at a football-chant soundalike.  Here, Gwen tells us that "uh-huh, this my s**t" and "this s**t is bananas".  And then helpfully spells out bananas, all under a "Hey Mickey" type repetitive drumbeat. Gwen attempts to sound a number of things..a) 17b) blackc) "street"d) like she had any idea what the hell a "hollaback girl" actually WAS until someone told her a week before the song was written.She fails on all accounts.  What she DOES come across as being is everything that, well, she is. A white, 35 year old rich married woman bringing in expensive young talent to help her sell albums.It's not only an unconvinving song, but a crass, ugly, tedious NOISE.  But it has the word "s**t" repeated loads and loads of times, so of course it sold by the bucketload. Sigh and double sigh.I shudder to think what she'll come up with next to top it. Gwen Gangsta Rap?The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.u
I heard this song on the radio the first time many months ago (and then for months and months it's been played nonstop).  I instantly hated it from the horrendous beat to the fact that Gwen Stefani is a 35 year old dressed up as a cheerleader with pom-poms and about 95% of the song is spent on the chorus "I ain't no hollaback girl" or "This s*** is bananas" section.  Pharell is a master producer and I chuckled because I thought that even the Neptunes can produce an occasional flop.  To my horror this song became the number one single for multiple weeks and became the most successful single of the entire summer (maybe even the entire year).  I don't see what people like about this song but apparently there is something I'm missing.  Like I said you either hate it or love it
I liked this when it first came out b/c I was 16. I was a rebel, wanted to be part of something different. This is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while.Favorite song is Mongoloid...totally strange but rocking song. "Uncontrollable Urge" rocks (in a weird way) and Come Back Johnny is almost a conventional song. Satisfaction is completely unique but its not a good song.  The group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a KISS, multi media, making money kind of thing.I saw them live (they were horrible) during their hey day. The most interesting thing about them is while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream, DEVO is still as odd of a group as ever. Mark Motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work (Rugrats) and you can hear the DEVO in all of his work.Anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is. DEVO came out as a Goof, not as serious musicians. They got big in the 70's b/c they were part of the new wave and kids (like me) were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own.
long studio sessions.  If you want a truly incoherent album strung together in a twisted way, then this is it.  If you don't, get Near the Beginning or Rock  Roll.  Get some of their quality stuff.  This definitely isn't it
Well, unless you are a hardcore collector like myself (had it originally on vinyl all those years ago), stay clear of this album. If you want to hear noise that you  your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself, then forget this album  make your own noise. The best track on the album is the bonus track. That tells you that this album has nothing to do with Beatles music. I give it one star for being terrible  one star for the packaging ;-).    Search Judemac Forever" on msn
Atleast they are trying this time around. Still no where near as good as the band was with Max. Pros: Faster and more back to their roots than the other releases without Max at the helm. Guitar playing is passable.Cons: Lack of solos. Derrick is still lacking as a vocalist. Just isn't as good as old Sepultura, songs lack hooks and are mostly forgetable.Bottom Line: This album falls short of expectations. The current Sepultura is nothing more than a very average metal band at best. If you like old Sepultura I suggest you not waste your money on this, but then again you might like it. Buyer beware
I'm a HUGE fan of Christopher Lawrence's stuff, but I aboslutely refuse to buy this CD because of the copy protection.  I do not pirate music, and should be allowed to copy music I purchase onto my MP3 player of choice.  This is just sad
For fans, I suppose this would be a rather big delight; for non-fans, it's nothing that will turn you on to the band from Jersey. They had some okay, cheesy hits in the '80s - but listening to some of their modern songs from this collection proves how completely out of touch they are nowadays
I guess I was expecting more of a Ferrante and Teicher thing with more than one piano going at a time ... could be that it is but, if so, am missing depth ... great family but disappointing albu
Unfortunately TTD went off the deep end on this album.  Consequently he put off many fans from buying the brilliant next album Symphony or Damn and the superb follow up Vibrator. If you loved the first album, give this one a miss and get the two I just mentioned.  Come on TTD hurry up and release a new album
i bought this album after hearing about them from a fellow beach boys fan.  i'm a huge pet sounds fan, but i love all kinds of orchestrated rock from "the left banke" to "beulah."  this album is not that good, people.  it's not even "okay."  there are way better takes on the "brian wilson" (read: phil spector) sound.  whether it's "the ladybug transistor" or "the apples in stereo."  heck, check out a great vancouver band called "ashley park" as well. the production on this is so rooted in the eighties/nineties that it's almost unlistenable.  they may be good road musicians but it doesn't show on this album, especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops "a la stone roses."  you would be better off going through the elephant 6 label's recordings or even merge stuff.  to be honest, i didn't even find the compositions that scintillating, regardless of the production.  chord and change-wise, they're interesting....but that doesn't make the songs good.
I purchased this disk along with others to play in my Acura DVD-A system.  I found the overall audio quality to be a bit disappointing...and the mix to be a bit "over the top" with surround effects.  Major vocals coming from rear speakers, etc. I also found the overall sound to lack the brightness and crispness on this specific disk. In fact, the demo disk for my TL has the Marvin Gaye song "Let's Get It On" and it is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection.If you are looking for DVD-A disks with 5.1 surround...I'd pass on this one and maybe purchase the CD of this album. 
Bits of Beatles,Zappa, Queen, (Herman's Hermits ?), may be laudable  in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator. Elfman's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal Musical pieces, they have fairly banal, repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music. Has the creepy competence of a Dave Grusin album. If you like that you'll be OK here
Ok I'll make it short but sweat great music, singing sucks...this guy is flat every song and he should go back to the honk tonk and get away from rock...if you think I'm lying listen close how can anyone listen to this voice, HE CAN'T HOLD A NOTE AND SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS A MOUTH FULL OF MUSH, he sucked atcountry and has no place in rock...home boy go back to Texas andget back to branded some cows cause you suck
Yeah, I am a big fan of moby, and accidentally buying the CD that almost ended his career doesn't shake that, if you want some good Moby might I suggest 18 or Play, this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise, but fail to build up to anything, everything else is Moby screaming in a traditional punk style, which were almost humorous, except, not [this much money] humorous, I am not a fan of this CD, I know he was starting out in a punk band, but his other stuff is much bette
Do yourself a favor and only buy his albums.  They're much more solid.  One Love. Peace
If you're looking for Billie in her prime, look elsewhere.  All the music on this CD was recorded between '45 and '47 after she had lost her voice.  Look for the classic recording of Strange Fruit from '39 on one of the other CDs available. 
This is the perfect CD for taking a nap to. It's mostly full of slow pop and rock. If you're a fan of this type of music, I recommend this CD, but if not, don't buy it. There are only a few good tracks. All Star, Bad Reputation, I'm A Believer, Stay Home. And I don't enjoy buying a CD that only 1/3 of it is good. So, I wouldn't buy it, if I were you.
(...)This CD is sub-par.  Most of the beats are cool, but they're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics
I like Meav's voice, and this CD is OK, if you like this kind of stuff. Think slow and somewhat depressing. I think Irish music has moved on so much since Bill Whehlan of Riverdance brought it into the modern times, and came up with this vocal sound, I guess to hark back to earlier times, which worked well because Riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music. This is all a bit samey and dull. I would say saved by this lady's fine voice though
I tried to listen to samples of the songs and you have them all wrong. I click on one song and get another from on the list. What gives anyway
well i'll explain that later. she uses her own vocals. she doesn't even have the balls to let the artists who rework the song use their own vocals.I love how the editoral review uses the term "unique vocal TALENT". Yoko has no vocal talents. I must also point out I am Courtney Love's number one fan, so this should give me even more cred. It just proves how narcissistic and disgusting yoko is that she won't let other artists do an album using their own vox. She loves the sound of her own too much!I already went through that stage where I made everyone listen her as a joke. I was about 14 then. My point here, this isn't even a good joke. Its just dumb.I listened to the song clips provided on amazon. even that was too much.if you must, just download this album for free. Do not buy it. Do not in any way support this woman. I wish there was a zero star rating.
I ordered this cd based on the reviews. First, I have to say that I am not sure why it is called 'Paris Under a Groove'. I was thinking that it would be in French, at least. The beats are nice, I would not in any way compare it to Buddha Bar.. I just wasn't as thrilled as I thought that I would be. It sounded very cheap. No originality. My fiancee is from Paris, and this was very disappointing- not only to him- but I was embarrassed as offering it as a present....So far, it sits on the shelf..
as far as drum and bass cds go this cd was terrible very boring and anything with clever on the cover im going to stay far away from nuff said
This is a copy of the review on Amazon.com for Van Zant's Get Right With The Man which is another Sony corrupted title."This CD secretly installs DRM (digital rights management) software on your PC without your permission. Not only does it do this, but the software then hides itself by installing as a "root kit."As per WikiPedia,--Root kitFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.A root kit is a set of tools used by an intruder after cracking a computer system. These tools can help the attacker maintain his or her access to the system and use it for malicious purposes. Root kits are known to exist for a variety of operating systems such as Linux, Solaris and versions of Microsoft Windows.A rootkit typically hides logins, processes, files, and logs and may include software to intercept data from terminals, network connections, and the keyboard.

After a very disappointing viewing of Harry's Only You Concert DVD, I got smart and borrowed Only You CD from the library. I'd hoped that concert was just one off. How sad, this CD is no better than that wretched concert. Slooooooooooooooow from the start to finish. And what happened to Harry's voice and phrasing? God, unbearable. When Harry Met Sally, Come by Me, what happened to you, Harry
Good music but a bad title!  Elvis has left the Planet but a new King has been born with the self proclaimed new King of Rock and Roll Ken Rondell at http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/bigra
I was, overall, disappointed by this CD.  There are many good reviews here, but they generally overpraise.  Tracks 4 through 8 have too much synthesizer for my ears.  A major highlight is track 9, The Crab and the Egret, but interestingly, the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous Chinese percussion.  Disappointingly, the CD is only 40 minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment
I don't see the comparison to Jeff Buckley AT ALL! That was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album. All the songs are much too similar, the guy's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and, if you remember London Suede, has a very similar sound to them (though I will say that London Suede was MUCH better). No one has come close to the pipes of J. Buckley (or even Tim B., for that matter) in years and this doesn't count any where near that, either

is it really necessary to take minute-long solos in every song? Really? If you like your solos long-winded and lacking in destination, and your lyrics trite (Get a Job???), check these guys out. If you actually plan on listening to the music you buy, skip it
AC/DC is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time, but they are not growing as musicians. Sure, they can rock like they used too, but they seem to be out of ideas. The well is dry. Put out a anthology already!!! At least my favorite band Deep Purple keep coming up with good stuff, and with imagination! The fact that Purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber. Anyway, better luck next time Angus  Co.Stiff Upper Lip~ AC/DC : 2 stars 
i feel that a lot of bands were good in the 90's. this band was one of them. while yes, they were a bit poppy and sellout-ish on americana and conspiracy, they still had enough bad@ss in them to put on a rad song.  i think they should have just did a "da hui" single with "the noose" and maybe "cant get my head around you" on it. this sucks really bad. it makes the average conspiracy of one look like a bad religion album!! if you must hear, download or borrow.please guys. quit or make good music. its pretty pathetic hearing "hit that" next to the godawful creed and nickelbland!!so we go from a punk-ish hard rock band that is inspired by TSOL and The Damned and plays punk shows with pennywise to this...a corporate radio rock album that is loved by teenybopper frat boys and the mtv mindless
As much as I like most of the songs on this CD...it's just too short. Also the production is lousy.  The recording quality sounds awful in places. Hopefully, the updated compilations are better. This one is not worth the money!!!
I bought this based on reviews of "Bass Queen in the Mix."  To me it sounds like the West Coast edition of Northern Exposure without the 4/4 house beat.  In other words, its very electronic sounding, almost completely non-vocal and not very funky at all.  I listened to "Eargasm" by Plump DJ's and Icey's "Funky Breaks" after this and it's definitely missing variety, skill in mixing and that "neck snapping" funky quality that make the Plumps and Icey so indispensible.  Not too bad but not that interesting either.  I prefer her "Mixtress" and still have not heard "Bass Queen..."  BTW, my speakers are flat down to below 30 hz and I didn't find the recording quality or the bass that impressive.  Listen to Crystal Method's "PHD" or "Block Rockin' Beats" by Chemical Brothers after this to see what I mean
There's a reason Oar flopped when it was released back in 1969: it sucks.  Thirty eight years later, with Skip Spence safely in his grave, some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars.  Since you can't give more than five stars here, they're saying Oar is on a level with masterpieces like Sergeant Pepper... Dark Side of the Moon... Led Zeppelin 4....!  Just between you and me, I think the government is still secretly drugging people.  With all due respect to Skip's venerable memory, Oar is a painful aural experience.  The first two tracks, Little Hands and Cripple Creek, are halfway good, and show some production values; but things quickly deteriorate from there.  One gets the impression the rest of Oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping - then put in the can after only one or two takes.  Lastly, the bass playing and drumming are just awful.Yes, it's too bad that things ended up like they did for Skip. And it's hard not to sympathize with him - he flew high only to crash hard.  But let's keep a sense of perspective: His tragedy did not translate into good music.  One extra star in his memory.
Every one is obbsessed with "Hips don't lie". Don't they relize that the songs horrible. Well, so is every other track on this album. Save your money to waste on something that is atleast some what decent
...unless it is rock and roll played by ac/dc. i f***ing HATE them. they are overplayed so much on the radio, and that is the most annoying voice i have ever heard in my life. don't waste your money on this cd, just turn on the radio...then turn it off
Ana Carolina is a good singer and Seu Jorge is a cult culture figure here in Brazil, but this CD is a mistake. Do not spend money on this
As if metalcore wasnt a chainsaw to your head enough, its absolutely ridiculous when metalcore bands mix emo with there already inoriginal sound. This band sounds like a even more flaccid Killswitch Engage, a Hawthorne Heights/Silverstein with downtuned guitars. As if it wasnt an abomination already, they even sing about vampires. Yes, thats right, vampires. And you couldnt get any g*yer.
I HATE THE BEATLES. THEY ARE AMONGST MY MUSIC GUIDE TOP 20 WORST BANDS EVER. THEY ONLY MADE A FEW DECENT SONGS IN HEY JUDE, LET IT BE, AND BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST STINK! EVEN A MARK KNOPFLER CD WITHOUT DIRE STRAITS IS BETTER THAN THIS! LIKE I SAID, ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO THE BEATLES OR ZEPPELIN DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD MUSIC IS ABOUT, HUH!!! GOOD MUSIC IS REQUIRED DIRE STRAITS, GREEN DAY, FOREIGNER, GNR, METALLICA, AND NIRVANA. GET ANY ALBUM FROM THOSE BANDS INSTED.THE BEATLES SUCK!!!!
The Dictators are incredible. Few bands can alternativly spoof and embrace the rock 'n' roll ideals as these guys have, and their Spinal-Tap-meets-Ramones-mees-Beach-Boys style almost always works - almost. "Manifest Destiny" is a dissapointing release from the 'Tators. I mean its not a bad album, but the guys can do much better than this. There are a few good songs. "Disease" is hilarious, particulary the spoken word act from Handsome Dick at the begining. "Science Gone Too Far" is one of the band's catchiest tunes, proving they were as good as any of the big names from the 60s. Their closing cover of the Stooges' "Search  Destroy" is an okay interperatation of the classic. However, that's about it. The rest are mostly humorless FM-style rockers, and while the Dictators weren't selling out, they were certainly trying to become more accesible. Download those three tunes, and pick up every other album by the band
I have to admit, I expected a lot more from Mr Setzer. The first track was ok, then it proceeded to go down hill from there. Not much rockabilly happening, then it all comes clear with "Really Rockabilly" when he slags off all his traditional rockabilly fans...world wide. He even gives us Aussies a serv, even though I don't think he has ever set foot here. If Brian wants to turn his back on rockabilly and try swing, jazz, rock or whatever, then go ahead, but why slag your old fans?. It's the last time I buy one of his CDs without listening to it first
After really enjoying the Amici Forever album, I went shopping for another Amici album and found this one.  There really is no comparison between the two.  I've tried listening to it several times to see if I'm missing something, but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the Lawrence Welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe. I was very disappointed
Hammerfall is one of the bigger names out there in the power metal world, and this cd sounds pretty much like the previous 5 albums. The only dofference is that they have gotten worse. I write this review to the two groups of people out there: The exisiting Hammerfall fans, and those trying them out for the first time. For already existing Hammerfall fans such as myslef, I strongly urge that you do not buy this cd, unless it goes below 3-4 dollars on amazon. For those looking to try Hammerfall out and get into the power metal genre for the first time, go ahead and get this one, because Hammerfall are by no means bad musicians. They can all play very well, but this cd lacks refinement and creativity. Start here and work your way up to the better Hammerfall, which you will no doubt appreciate more. Hammerfall keeps putting out the same album over and over and over, if you know what I mean. All of their songs sound relatively similar, but this cd marks one of the lowerest points in their career
Young Jeezy even proclaims not to be a rapper; yet, he is a motivational speaker.  So, in this case, he is trying to speak to the youth of hip-hop culture that selling drugs and carrying guns is the cool thing to do.  He should just consider himself a rapper; that way, when he's using grade-school rhyme patterns to get his message across, we can just call him a bad rapper instead of a bad role model.Anyways, with that diatribe aside, this album is nothing new from Jeezy.  We all saw it coming.  He picks out some great beats, but cannot provide the great lyrics to go along with them.  Therefore, an uneven album ensues.  "I Luv It" was the first single and is a prime example.  If this beat might have reached someone such as T.I. or maybe even a group like Clipse, this would've been a great song.  However, it's Jeezy, so it's gonna be a letdown.  That's pretty much what this album is; a letdown.  After guest spots on "Grew Up a Screw Up" with Ludacris and the posse cut remix "Top Back" with T.I.  B.G., i was expecting alot from Jeezy this time around.  However, all i got were two tracks ("Go Getta" with R. Kelly  "3 A.M." with Timbaland) that are recommendable.  The rest of the album is plagued with horrible lyrics over average-to-above average production.  If you're looking for "inspiration," look away from this "trap-star.
Who in the world called this ''Hard Rock''?!???????????!!? This is a bunch of self-pitying, mainstream jibberish..nothing interesting at all. I shall dub this as ''Alternative Whine''.
this soundtrack does NOT have all the songs in it from the movie.  i was looking for two from the movie, and the soundtrack did not have them.  like, a song by michelle branch that is in the movie is not in there.  bo
Is this the same Kool Keith that created Dr. Octagon, Dr. Dooom, and Black Elvis?  Spankmaster represents a regression of creative energy.  It sounds like Keith decided he wanted to make a record one morning and whimsically threw together some tracks.  It contains little of the genius of his earlier CDs.  With the exception of a couple songs (jewelry shine and Blackula), this album stinks
This CD is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical.A better alternative would be to listen to either:a) the original artists who influenced this band orb) someone at least trying to do something new with music.To enjoy this CD you'd have to really want to like this band, either because you liked Dig or because you're attracted to their super-cool reputation.If you're afraid you're missing out on something by not owning BJM's back catalogue don't worry, you're not.
As others have noted, this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in Spanish sung by Maria Del Rey, plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men (not very good for putting a baby to sleep), plus the whole thing repeated in English.  In addition, I had been looking for traditional Latin American pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary.  Don't waste your money...I'm planning on giving my copy away if I can figure out someone I know who could actually use it
Don Caballero have always had members leave, but this is ridiculous.  Che is not Don Cab even if he is an amazing drummer and started the band.  Ian Williams for one is a huge reason for the Don Caballero sound that I always gravitated towards and without him the band is incomplete.  Why Che decided on naming this new group under the Don Caballero name rather than Speaking Canaries or something else baffles me.  More importantly, the music is BORING on this album.  It's like the new members only influences were Yes and ELP sans vocals.  In other words, no spontaneity, hardly and time changes or dynamics and weak predictible guitar/bass lines.  Avoid this album like the plague and pick up any of the Battles EPs or better yet get the real Don Cab works like Singles Breaking Up or What Burns.  There is a ton of other great instrumental bands old and new in this type of vein that blow this "new" Don Caballero to pieces
Outside of 'Curious' sung by Tina Cousins, this album is a dud -- at least by 'Believe' standards. Most songs sound similar with the same beat. The album won't make your ears bleed, but the band should have quit calling itself '4 Strings' after the departure of Vanessa. It is a very different band now, and should not tease 'Believe' fans into thinking another 4 Strings album of simliar quality and vocals is being released. I would buy 'Curious' if it can be purchased separately, but would skip buying this album. If a future reviewer knows where Vanessa ended up, please let me know. The mixers of the group are talented, but Vanessa was the real star
after reading glowing reviews of the DBTs I picked up three of their cds. While some of the lyrics are strong, the songs have no melodies whatsoever. Most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer. They're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of Skynyrd and the Allmans. But those bands weren't just loud guitars...they had memorable tunes and great singers. DBTs are a huge letdown
I am a BR5-49 aficionado from the early days at Robert's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks.  Admittedly, I long for those days as much as I long for stirrups in Major League Baseball.  So I'm nostalgic, "IT'S A FREE COUNTRY."  It is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels.  Yet, whenever I read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has "matured," I can do nothing but cringe.  Here's the flowchart:  Band starts out - Band plays hard - Band gets cult following - Band gets reputation - Band strikes out on road - Band gets contract - Band gets a little more pub. - Band gets contract with bigger label - Band gets new management supplied by label - Band gets "coached" in next recording - Band changes faces along the way - Band changes label again - Band gets new direction from new label - Band fights for identity - Band produces new "mature" album - Band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process.Gee, I sure hope this isn't how the end of BR5-49 comes about, but enough of the doom and gloom of impending implosion.  This record is OK.  Of course, I realize that any band can't just re-hash the same 'ol stuff on every album, but part of what got these guys so much early attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on the vinyl.  One part of this was their ability to do cover songs usually better than the originals, and a simple taste of this is what I sorely miss in the last few recordings.  This band live used to be a wild, jittery, moving organism on stage, and although they are still a solid live show (saw them on the last tour at Poor David's Pub in Dallas), something has settled down. Chuck is a great talent, but an early appeal of the band was the vocal volley of Chuck and Gary Bennett. Ok, I'll go cry me a river, but dammit, just go listen to the Big Backyard Beat Show one more time.  Mature?  I just don't want to grow up that bad
I used to like Rob Zombie, up until Hellbilly Delux.  Everything after that is garbage.  This album is no exception.  Every song sounds the same and is very predictable.  The lyrics are nonsensical, Educated Horses?  He says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this CD, I think he is running out of material and throwing crappy CD's together to scrap in some extra money.  He needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented.  I don't recommend this CD to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his CD's/merchandise regardless.  1 star, I went through this CD in less than 10 minutes, very disappointed, and will never put it back into a CD-player again
Sounds like it should be in a Meg Ryan romantic comedy.Did they intentionally try to erase his personality? Sounds like it was produced in Nashville!  This should be a demo for another singer to record.It's just too schmaltzy for me.  I think Phil Ramone may be slipping too.  Billy is a much better singer than this.After listening to this song I instinctively lit a match.  I'm going to go listen to Glass Houses
I'm a big fan of "The Boss", but for the life of me, can't fathom why he is unable to follow the lead of larger acts, and actually "unplug" for MTV Unplugged.  This CD offers no new material that can't be found elsewhere, and is basically nothing more than a "live in concert" CD that just so happened to be filmed by MTV.This concert took place in 1992, and you know it's pretty bad when you have bands ribbing you three years later about going on MTV UNPlugged, and then having to go and plug in.  It's not like Bruce doesn't know how to play acoustic guitar, because he does.  I'm a big acoustic guitar fan, and for someone of Bruce's talent level, to not be able to write songs that can be played acoustically only serves to bring down the level of respect I have for his talent.Not what I would consider an essential recording, and not recommended, unless you are such a die-hard "Boss" fan that you have to own every album he puts out.  Otherwise, save your money
I have all 5 volumes and this is the only one I don't like.  The selection of music is just plain bad.  There are a few songs that are OK but most are just dull, dull, dull.  I recommend going with one of the first 4 volumes instead
I don't know who these people are, but they will give praise for ANYTHING!  Ms. London is a wonderful singer, but the producers must have given her sleeping pills.  This is a boring CD!  Like Peggi Blu, who won Star Search, her record company "toned her down" for her debut album, with banal and boring songs with that stupid hip/hop "dum de dum" Mary J. Blige beat, which will send you to nowheresville.  Aretha Franklin's boring SO DAMN HAPPY was so awful, it's no longer available.  She went "Mary J." and almost lost the crown off her head.  Because she's Aretha Franklin (Queen of Soul) she DID manage (somehow) to get a non-deserved Grammy for "Wonderful" from that CD.  The Grammys also presented The Queen with her 17th competitive Grammy for her "A House Is Not A Home" mess.  What MUST they be thinking?Well, LaToya London won't be considered for ANYTHING for this hip/hop mess.  She should get serious about some R  B (I mean the REAL r  b) and leave this light-weight fluff alone.  LaToya, you have a great voice -- use it.  Contact Sam Dees, Jo Armstead or Ashford  Simpson and BEG for some material! And, as Madame Rose would say, "Sing Out, Louise!!!
As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice.  I even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels.Her voice on this CD is quite far removed from what she was once capable of, and in fact I would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on Bowery Songs, and her earlier quality.Like some professional athletes, she seems to not know when to quit...
Being a huge Blondie fan, I WANT to rate this one higher, but sadly I cannot. It's just a sad mishmash of bad songs, it feel very negligant too. I love the way Blondie contributed to rap and disco, but their calypso number on this one is so awful. They had lost it here.Check out thier truly great albums instead like paralel lines or eat to the beat..
You'll find better works out there, particularly if you're a Miles fan.   The emphasis here is on Milt Jackson and his vibraphone, which gives the  album a light, airy feeling.  Missing is much of Miles' horn and sentiment.   You also get a bit shortchanged with a mere 30 minutes of music.  I would  call this a pleasant album, which in my jazz-world is not a  happy thing
Actually Garth Hudson, the former organist of the Band does not play on this cd (nor 'every geriatric rockstar's'). The musician you might be referring to is Al Garth ex of Loggins/Messina
I was misled and thought I was buying the entire cd and it contains one song
This album is all about sex and infidelity, is this all way Usher's life is about. This album contains to substance worth listening to. This album is a total waste of money. I like 8701 100 percent better
The quality of the samples is better than the quality of the recordings. 
John Coltrane was villified most of his creative life for playing at the edge of a world he was helping to redefine. Wynton and the LCJO are in effect the death of creative musicians like Coltrane, or most of the truly creative Jazz scene for that matter. Wynton is establishing himself as "the face of Jazz". A market oriented phenomenon which freezes some of the elements making Jazz without ever capturing the true essence of the music. By telling us (and make no mistake, these guys do...): "this is what Jazz is" and trying to re-appropriate themselves the music of Jazz giants such as John Coltrane who, if he were alive, would not be given the time of day by these folks, Wynton and his posses are raping what is true and beautiful in this music. The recording, since I must talk about it, features a set of crafty yet discomboluted arrangements merely mimicking what Coltrane was, mostly empty of content, setting in motions soloists who sound more like "Jazz puppets" than anything remotely close to what Coltrane was striving for (notable exception: Ted Nash !).You do NOT need this record. Wynton and the LCJO does NOT need your money; spend it on musicians who put their life and their art on the edge, the way Coltrane did
This CD was a Big Seller upon it's release in 1992, boasting a Plethora of Big Hits, along with some New Songs.  Looking back through 2005 Eyelids, it's hard to hear why these songs were so Huge....The CD starts off well, with Hits from the Primitive Love Album, but as One keeps listening, He realizes that None of these songs have Passion or Depth, a few catchy Melodies and Pleasant, if Plain Vocals.  The Dance Numbers at least keep You awake, but the Years 1988-92 found Estefan leaning on Ballads, and One was barely distinguishable from another; on top of that, the 4 New Cuts feel like padding, to fill a CD's worth of material for a Christmastime Release...a Couple of Hits are missing, too(i.e., Bad Boys), so to summarize, Nothing truly Bad here, but precious little on Target...
Most people seem to like the soundtrack from"Glory",but this fact does not necessarily make"Glory"a great,or even good soundtrack...Most people also like the food served atMacdonald's,but no intelligent person would argue in favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbers...It is something to put in one's mouth whenever nothing better is available and one is hungry...The same might be said regarding"Glory"...If one's tastes run to choir music,almost any gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid choir music to be found here...As for the themes,they are commonplace variations,often bootlegged from other scores by the same composer,or new work that the composer later bootlegged into other scores,so,all in all,the effort plays rather like a buffet offering at a cheap,"homestyle"diner...The film,on the other hand,was well done,and,apparently,from reading many of the other reviews here,the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction with the film itself,rather than very much stand-alone praise for the score.Horner has written a lot of really,really beautiful and original scores,but perhaps because most of his best efforts have been for small or little-noticed movies these have not been recognised for thier greatness...So,in sum,we are left with a very popular film,provided with a very mundane score by an award winning composer
While I like some of these songs, I cannot understand a single word he sings.  I even heard him interviewed and I didn't understand a word.  When he sings, he spends all the time looking down, so you can't even lip read.  I don't think he has stage presence and I think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who can't form words.  He doesn't sing clearly and I just can't get into his music completely.  I think I'll stick to R
After chancing upon Galactic's rather remarkable live show at a local bar, I jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc. Wasn't worth the effort, I'm afraid. Velveeta on Wonder Bread-dull collection of acid jazz  duds. Not bad as background noise for your next dinner party, but captures  exactly none of the blood and soul that make Galactic such a great live  act. A pass for all but Galactic completeists, if such an animal exists
Okay, here is the major problem with this release: it is not a TuffGong/Island release. The Marley family has struggled with this reality for a long time. Because Bob's music has become so widespread and lacks the legal protections that American and European recording artists have enjoyed for decades, his recordings have gone onto the cheap market (flea markets, push carts, gas stations, etc-and now Amazon). Buying One Love only serves to strengthen these sleazy record companies and hurts reggae artists and the Jamaican economy. Look closely at the albums before you buy them. Find out what label has produced them and try to stick with TuffGong when possible.
I'm sure glad I did not purchase this cd.  Back in the 1980's I had very little knowledge about O'Bryan Burnnette, but now that I am 22 and appreciate old school music a whole lot more, I know they made several mistakes while releasing this compilation.  "Soul Trains A Comin" (although not a chart hit) was missing.  I would perfer the original version than the 12 inch version used for Soul Train from seasons 13-"Maria" (a lackluster lp track from his latest lp, Surrender) should have been replaced with the beautiful "Together Always" (from his proper sophmore lp, You  I).  The horrible and silly "Drivin' Force" (also from Surrender) should have been out!  "Lovelite", "You  I" and "I'm Freaky" lp versions should have been on there instead of the 45 versions because they stood out very well!!  "Is This For Real," Right From The Start," and "Love Has Found Its Way." were the other great ballads and jams that were non-singles but were gems as well.  The absense of "Soul Trains A Comin'(original)", "Together Always", and full versions of "You  I", "I'm Freaky", and "Lovelite" really knocked off 3 points from Best of O'Bryan cd and should be made into a redo!!  For those that wasted thier money on this, "go on and cry" because Right Stuff Records done ripped y'all off!!  This underated talented artist (good singer, writer, producer, and instrumentalist) was trying to be the next Prince and Michael Jackson but he was considered more like a 1980s version of Carl Thomas (too soulful for the mainstream).  People must have bought this cd (if do not have original lps no more) because more than half of the tracks are not available on other cds.   I admit I love all the songs from the cd (except for Maria and Driving Force), but I WILL create a new CD under my productions, SOUL TRAIN ALUMNI SERIES along with my own compilations of Shalamar, Jermaine Stewart, Pebbles, Jody Watley and other Soul Train almumnis.  1. Soul Trains A Comin' (original although I love the remix; loved the keyboard fanfare on the intro)2. The Gigolo3. Still Waters4. Right From The Start (great track and catchy hooks!!)5. I'm Freaky (full lp verison, the keyboard solo was missing from the 45 single 4 minute version)6. You  I (full original lp version.  Loved the closing)7. Together Always (O showed his true feelings on this 1983 track)8. Lovelite (full original lp version - LOVELITE BABY!!)9. Breakin' Together (good effort and loved the video!!)10. Go On  Cry (good ballad)11. Lady I Love You (what ever happened to lovin' your woman and tellin' her how you feel.  This was his best ballad ever and this  should school young catz like Bobby Valentino and R Kelly on real love.)12. You're Always On My Mind (I'm glad they included this lp track from 1984's Be My Lover on the compilation and would be good for the redo.  Beautiful ballad that shows a woman on how you feel although she's seeing someone else).  13. Tenderoni (45 single, I never actually heard of the full lp track before but it was a good pre-new jack single)14. Is This For Real (great!!!)15. You Have Got To Come To Me (beautiful new jack ballad that should have made the charts)This here is the real Best of O'Bryan plus more.  Wish I can add more like "I'm In Love Again", "Doin' Alright", "Surrender" "Love Had Found Its Way" and "Shake" but had to pick the best 16 that would fit!!                                                          -- Thank You!!
I agree with the other negative review below- Uninspired, simply forgettable radio trash.  Cliched lyrics?  Check.  Muddy, simple riffs?  Check.  Boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks?  Check.  Thank god I got this in a box of cd's from a DJ buddy of mine for free awhile back.  If I actually paid for this crap I'd have to kill myself.  Judging from all the "positive" reviews however, it seems some people at Lava records or possibly the band themselves (if they're still around.  I hope not.) have been trying to plug this  sorry excuse for music. 
When the Airplane kept it tight as in 'white rabbit' 'somebody to love' they were a force to be reckoned with, but when they got ideas above their station as in this live album there musical weakness really showed. Now i happen to think that Jack Cassidy just about saves the band with that bass, but even he can't stop the monotony of 'bear melt' and 'rock me baby' surely the worst version i've ever heard and this is all down to JOrma Kaukonen's nasal vocal and mediocre guitar soloing. The guy maybe a great acoustic picker but his lead work leaves a lot to be desired and this is from someone who had to endure his interminably uninspired lead work at a Hot Tuna gig. Anyone who saw the clip in Woodstock will know what i mean..No wonder Hendrix's set was so eagerly awaited!Occasionally the band get it together and Balin and Slick's vocals mesh together brilliant, but on the whole the set is an endurance test and the studio versions are far more immediate. Face it when it comes down to it very few West Coast bands could stretch out and reach the heights of say Cream or Ten years after. As i said Casady is per usual on form but the drumming is fairly pedestrian throughout lacking the kick that could push the jams into another gear. It's better than 'thirty seconds' but then again anything is. If you think that 'happy trails' and 'live dead' are musical highpoints than this will complete the set, but i just think its sleep inducing
I just purchased my sacd player and picked up Boston and Billy Joel's the Stranger at the same time.  After listening to the Stranger, my mouth dropped.  Billy's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction.  Then I put in Boston and couldn't tell a difference from the cd version I already own.  I think it's one of the best albums, but if you already own it on cd, don't bother upgrading - there's nothing special about the SACD version
Van Dyke Parks did the arrangements on Sam Phillips's debut 'The Indescribable Wow', an album I love so much I thought I'd give 'Song Cycle' a shot.What a feeerocious disappointment! I'd give it zero stars if I could, but amazon wouldn't let me! My god, that singing voice of his reminds me of David Bowie... "The Laughing Gnome" Bowie, that is... I've seen the word "coy" pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his singing, er, style, but I'll go them all one better... "smug". All I hear in it is "Ooh, I'm so smart. What a clever lad am I." The arrangements or orchestrations, or whatever you call them are all pointless. It gives me the feeling that Van's dad bought him an orchestra and said, "Here, son, have fun." So young Van did... without ever really learning how to use it properly. Randy Newman KNOWS how to use an orchestra; check out his best album 'Sail Away'. The arrangements are tasteful and, key word here, SPARE. He never clubs us over the head with them. The lyrics, if we can call them such, have no attachment whatsoever to the music.... but then again since I wrote that the arrangments are pointless I guess it's to be expected.So, what we have is a trifecta of awfulness: bad voice, bad lyrics, and bad music.HOWEVER, he did make 'Song Cycle' in 1968 and worked on 'The Indescribable Wow' in 1988... so he did learn a thing or two in 20 years, namely that arrangements are NOT songs; they're used to highlight a certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to the listener... maybe Randy pulled him aside once to tell him that...

Camera Obscura is similar, in an inferior manner, to Nico, of the Velvet Underground  Nico.  The band makes pleasantly dull "chamber pop" in the vein of Belle  Sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years.  Even their name is ripped off of Nico's last studio album, Camera Obscura.  But, as I said before, Camera Obscura is much worse than Nico.  If you want to hear what music like this was meant to sound like, pick up "Chelsea Girl," Nico's first solo album
Someone suggested I listen to this because I was, at the time, into what lame beret-wearing record-store dips would call "creatively aggresive" music.  Then it was death metal (which I prefer without cursing or filth, you understand.)  Since then I've found the ascension into gabber and then full-on unmitigated hardcore.Anyway, Mr. Bungle.... tepid.  Uninteresting.  Bland.  Stupid.  Gives the chin-strokers something to fascinate over.  Let them.  Someone's got the fuel the economy
Whilst Leo Kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and John Fahey like a man with at least 11 or 12 fingers, Robbie Basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs. That this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by Kottke or Fahey (or Peter Lang) is puzzling to say the least. But, credit where credit's due: it's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant
This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste.Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money
It' curious how an interesting history can be not well told by a modern music. In some cases the music go to the hand with the story, but not in this CD, in which we say the music that it is not for the story. I didn't ejoyed with that C
The 4 CD mini Gibson Amp 'box-set'leaves off genuine off vinyl 78, and Lp 'harder-to-get' Charlie Christian/Benny Goodman recordings.  Legacy states "MASTER TAKES", but absolutely fails to research deep into Charlie Christian's recording history.Columbia vinyl 2Lp 30779, (1972), and Columbia 78rpm C -102 along with the Columbia "Sextet" Cds leave legacy far behind.The Wang Wang Blues -78rpm isn't in the 4CD set, and there are far too many 'false-starts', which Benny Goodman discarded for a good reason.  Star Dust is only about 3 minutes, it's 8 minutes on vinyl.  There is even In-studio handclapping after some tunes.I have the 78s, many Col. Lps, and there is no "Studio-Live" takes.  This 4 CD box could have, and should have been much better in information, content and genuine Charlie Christian guitar stylings.  The 2 readily available BG Sextet Cds are a better purchase idea, but there are still those super hard-to-get vinyl Lp tracks, which ARE "The Master Takes", left Off the legacy/Sony box set.  Musicologist's suggestion, try to get the vinyl Lps.  Skip this misleading 4 CD set of various tracks, + handclapping = NOT "Good Enough To Keep", (AirMail Special).Try the 2 Benny Goodman/Charlie Christian Columbia CDs, Amazon has both, and most of the Benny Goodman Sextet 'takes' are Master Takes, and "Good Enough To Keep!
It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality. Also glad to here that she will be making a country CD next, it will fit her voice well.
I think someone forgot to tell Molotov that Rap-Metal/Rock-Rap was Dead. Had potential, but the simple riffage and annoying rapping killed it for me
Buyer beware. These new Journey releases are reissues of their 1996 remastered releases. They are NOT remastered in 2006. Rhino should be ashamed of itself for this (it's been 10 years - I would have gladly paid for a remastered version, but not for new packaging)
First they started out as nu-metal, then they moved onto metalcore, and now psuedo-death metal. It should be no surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are clearly following trends, and after each trend dies, they just move on to another one. If my calculations are correct, expect a psuedo-black metal release.But, what about the musicians? Sure, they have a fast drummer...who likes to trigger alot, then they have two guitarists...who like to steal Pantera riffs, and then they have the singer, who, well, sounds just like all the rest. Atleast they dont have the DJ anymore (oh wait, they do, nevermind.)Enough of my rambling, how does this untalented group of posers fair up? Well, image if Mushroomhead went metalcore. 'Nuff said.Avoid
Garbage metal - music for the American mainstream to feed on.  I saw them open for Slayer about 4-5 years back, and they had about 5 guys on stage doing nothing except JUMPING UP AND DOWN.  How pathetic ! Pick up some real metal.... like old Kreator. 
Most other reviewers listed here believe that this CD is good - I wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary Mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier Mannheim CD's have made it difficult to critique a Mannheim offering!  I am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life - and this particular CD sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music, just with different chords.  In fact, if I was not paying specific attention, I couldn't tell when one song ended and another started!  I enjoyed what I heard, but I was certainly expecting more from this CD - many of these Disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings - at the very least, some variety seems to have been called for.  Disney has always included great music with their movies, running the gamut of musical styles such as classical, jazz, blues, and even hip-hop - so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high.  I do, however, highly recommend Mannheim CD's in general - just not this one
Having been a casual fan of Stax records for a few years; I decided earlier this year that I should go all out and splurge on this 9-CD box set. Big mistake.I have many, many complaints about this set; but what it basically boils down to is that this whole set is an absolute mess. It misses many key B-sides such as Otis Redding's "Hard To Handle" and Booker T  The MG's "Tic Tac Toe"; and doesn't even include every a-side the label released, despite the title of the compilation (where are the sides that Hoyt Johnson released for the label?). The linear notes by Steve Greenberg (the man who gave us that phony "Soul Queen" Joss Stone; and the headache-inducing Baha Men) are horrible, mostly focusing on his personal opions of the artists and/or songs rather than the stories behind them. And within the sections for each disc in the booklet; they entries aren't actually arranged in any particular order (least of all the order of the tracks on the CDs, that would make too much sense). And there should've been more photos, too.Add to this the set's main problem: the music. The fact is that most of the songs on here are really lame. Seriously. "Why did you buy it, then?" I hear you say. Well; the Stax songs I was familiar with (such as "Green Onions"; "B-A-B-Y"; "You Don't Miss Your Water"; "(Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay"; "Soul Man"; "Born Under A Bad Sign" etc) are all great songs. "Well, why don't you like this set then" you're thinking. Answer: because the 30-or-so great songs on here are sandwiched between over 200 filler songs over 9 discs.If you think I'm being harsh on these songs, I'm not; I can appreciate songs like Wendy Rene's "Bar-B-Q" and the Memphis Nomad's "Don't Pass Your Judgement"; but aside from a few good numbers and a few pleasent-but-dull numbers, most of the non-hits on here are pretty bad.Basically, if you really like a Stax artist then go and buy a best-of for that artist; if your looking for a sampler of Stax's best songs, then go and buy the 4-CD Stax Story; don't bother with this one
After two albums of wholly instrumental music, Joe Satriani apparently decided it was time to start singing.  "Flying in a Blue Dream" is the only Satriani record with several (six) vocal cuts.So how are they?  Well, Satch's voice isn't superb, but he does an ok job.  The problem really is with the material-- it's clear he'd gotten used to writing pieces as guitar features.  The only real exception to this in my assessment is frantic electric blues "Big Bad Moon"-- the piece is blazing and explosive, the vocal is passable, and Satriani is on fire.  But pieces like "Ride", "The Phone Call" and "Strange" are all pretty much forgettable (well, "Ride" is actually a bit too irritating to be forgettable...).The remainder of the material is a mix between exploratory (and primarily acoustic) pieces ("The Feeling") which are nice but largley filler and "Surfing With the Alien" styled instrumentals ("One Big Rush", "Back to Shalla-Bal").  The exception is the chugging opener and title track, "Flying in a Blue Dream", which features Satriani at his most lyrical as a guitarist.Invariably, the album is a bit too weak for its own good-- it's probably also a bit too long (about 65 minutes) and probably would have benefited from being trimmed down a bit.  Start with "Surfing With the Alien", come back to this if you want more of the same

My copy of "Reckless Nights..." (and yours, too, probably) has a sticker on front that reads: "One of the Most Influential Musicians of the 20th Century."  Well, I'm so glad that Columbia cleared that up.  Otherwise, I'd have had to make up my OWN mind, and apparently music labels don't allow that nowadays.  I hope similar stickers are included on Chopin, Mozart, and Bach CDs (with the century adjusted on a per-composer basis).Scott's gimmicky fare makes for pleasant listening, but not in such a large dose--monotony sets in after two or three titles, let alone 22. Halfway through this CD, I felt as if I were listening to the drone of a defrosting icebox.  For all the outrageous hyperbole thrown at Scott--no one else like him, no way to categorize his music, and so on, and so on--the reality is that composers and arrangers like Ferde Grofe, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Alec Templeton, and Bill Challis covered the same ground far more skillfully--and, in most instances, earlier--than Scott.  Concert jazz, symphonic jazz, or whatever you wish to call it, was NOT the invention of any one man, and certainly not Scott.  Check out Grofe's scores for Whiteman--in particular, his writing for woodwinds and his constant, Scott-esque use of muted trumpet.  Listen to Duke Ellington's "extended" compositions circa 1929.  For that matter, listen to Ellington's 1933 "Daybreak Express"--virtually the template for Scott's galloping miniatures.  Experience Bill Challis and Glenn Miller's pioneering big band charts.  Or... believe as you're told to believe, i.e. that Scott, and Scott alone, performed this kind of music.  I mean, who needs history when we've got hype?  It's up to YOU, dear listener
The CD came as promised and in the condition promised.  I'm very satisfied
I do not understand why people are so waxing poetic about this album.  There is nothing new or 'fresh' or 'original' or at all thought-brovoking about this music, unless you happen to be easily pleased by any simple pseudo-pop sound.  I have only recently discovered the world of no-wave music, but I was introduced to it through artists like Arab on Radar and Scissor Girls.  So when I tried out my first Sonic Youth album, I was way more than dissapointed.  I don't know how this can be classified as no-wave anymore.  Sure they show some trait in a few wailing off key guitars and an occasioinal shouted spoken word, but they are all only half-assed and are muddled up in cliche indie pop love tunes that have only been done in every other band.  The most notable anything is the catchy medlody of Becuz.  It is really catchy, yet it managaes to be unique enough to rise above the typical "catchy tunes" ethos.  Xiu Xiu's "Knife Play" would probably be considered more of a pop/no-wave sound that does not sacrifice the aggressive anti-music drive of no-wave... AND still retain the emotional pop sinsibility.  I don't know.. All I know is that Wasing Machine is a letdown.  It does not reach me artistically by a long shot.  Emotionally, I can think of am million other artists (Mars Volta, Emerson Lake  Palmer, cLOUDDEAD, Ulver, Edvard Greig!) who can put me on a much higher cloud and help me get in touch with the human condition.  This however is far to cheezy, and I don't know, but I think it reeks of that shallow indie fashion clique..
Here's a line from the song Vato on this album: "I wouldn't be the n_____ that I am if I didn't pop n____z in the mouth."Isn't that poetic? Snoop Dogg manages to pull off an amazing feat. He makes sex, drugs and violence seem so ... boring. I feel like I am supposed to be offended. But it's too boring to be offensive. We have songs about every kind of gang violence, every kind of drug, and every kind of cheap sex. And what are we left with?He gets two stars because his approach to the city of Los Angeles is fresh and loving. Hip Hop should be local, and he does a good job with that. Otherwise it'd be a one-star
This recording is not great company.  I'm really confused: is it a Broadway recording or a very poor amatuer recording?  And if so, did this rubbish actually make it to the Broadway stage?  I feel for the people that saw it, and were expecting the rich full melodies that Sondheim produced for this show.  The Musical Director for this abomination should be called a Mutilation Director, because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show.  So the only advice I give to future Musical Directors that want to revive and revamp a show: If it's not broke, please, please, please don't try and fix it!  Some things are just perfect the way they are.  Don't buy this CD.  I did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use
I played several samples of this CD on my computer while visiting the Amazon website and my male cat started meowing along.  This CD is good for calming a cat and lining his box.Face it, Yoko can't sing (unless you have a cat's ears.)
wots happened to memphis hiphop it goin out the window or its already gone out the window there pushin any old sh'' out for bucks anyone who is in2 real memphis years 94 to 98 2000 max when rappers were hungry no,s wot im talkin about old underground tapes the only guy doin stuff to that form now is evil pimp and thats a bit over the top but come on guys we want them simple murder beets back with them sik lyrics instead of that shoutin crunk sh,t 36 is now pushin,,,, get back to your roots alot of people are now reachin out for the old siccness from back in the day tommy wright playa fly kinda sh,t even koopstas devil playground piss,s on this wack sort your stall out koopsta
Certainly not deserving of the Grammy (for cast recording).  Each of the other nominated productions is MUCH BETTER than this poor excuse of a revival.
DE LA PROLIFERACION DE BANDAS ANGLOPARLANTES DE LOS '70,NO ENCUENTRO MOTIVOS PARA DESTACAR ESTA PLACA....UNA MAS Y NADA MAS UE ESO..DESPUES DE TODO, ES MI HUMILDE OPINION....HUMM..HUMBLE PIE, DESCANSA TRANQUILO....
Wow guys... How many of you are on crack?Ive given this album 2 whole listens an it still sucks ass. Besides if I should have to listen to something more than a few times to know its hot then its wack. Cause if you listen to ANYTHING enough you will like it. It's human nature...Keith, ummm... Excuse me " Dr. Octagon " is a retard, mentalcase, and has no lyrical ability. Half of you people like this just cause its so different. What he says makes no sence, and has no meaning. That which he does say that does make sence is nasty, and weak. His flow is awefull. His delivery is AWEFULLL. Automator does a good job on the boards making nice beats, but Keiths lame ass f***s up good beats...Feel free to click that you dont agree with this Kool Keith d***riders. :
First Bill has never nor will he ever be a jazz musician. It seems that those who branch out and play multiple styles are often lauded for expanding the vocabulary. Here's what chaps my hide the most. Bill has somehow captured the attention of hordes of budding guitarist with their effect pedals all strung out as if they were getting ready for a space shuttle launch. It burns me too no end when a person calls himself a jazz guitarist, but doesn't really have any chops. I know Bill has been called anti-technique, but what does that really mean? Would you want a heart transplant performed by a surgeon that means well, but really isn't very good at what he/she does? This guy is getting built up as something new and it seems every time I turn around someone that knows absolutely nothing about jazz guitar is throwing this guy in my face. I've been a professional jazz guitarist for 12 years and teaching for 8 years. When I have guys that actually debate me that Bill is somehow doing more interesting things than say Pat Martino, or that Bill could somehow hang in a jam session with someone like Pat Martino, I have to shake my head in disbelief in how twisted and mixed up this world has become when charlatans are giving more credit than someone like Pat who has been on the road for years and paid dues that Frisell couldn't imagine. Is Bill Frisell a Jazz musician, No! Maybe if the guy could woodshed for a dozen years he'd come up with something. For me I'll stick with the guys that really know how to play......Johnny Smith, Peter Leitch, Jim Hall, Pat Martino, Kenny Burrell, Billy Bauer, Tal Farlow, Lenny Breau, Jimmy Bruno, Jimmy Raney, Wes Montgomery and so on
I would call this the musical equivalent of the worst of abstract art.  There are those that "appreciate" unintelligable works for fear of being thought stupid if they don't . . . just as the emporer's subjects "Ooh"ed and "Ah"ed in admiration of his clothing as he paraded naked in front of them
If this had been the first album in the "Hip-Hop Hits" series, it would not be a promising start. There are a few decent tunes on here, but as someone who admired the quality of the earlier Source albums, I must express an intense dislike for "Hip Hop Hits Vol.8". There used to be a time when The Source gathered the biggest AND best tracks from the rap indusrty for their compilations, now Benzino has turned the series into a shameless promotion for his own favorites (How else do you explain Ja Rule being here?). Here is a song-by-song analysis of this disaster:(1) YoungBloodz feat. Lil Jon  "Damn" C-. This song is perfect example of why people are getting bored with "Sothern Crunk". It's lame and boring, as it shows Lil Jon becoming a one-trick pony. Not a good song to open an album with.       (2) Wyclef "The Industry" B. Wyclef is very talented,but this song was never a hit. It should be heard for its quality though, even if it only touchs topics breifly. It is clear that Wyclef is above most of his peers in everyway; sorta like 2Pac.  (3) Chingy "Right Thurr" B+. Not my favorite rap song,its better than average though, it kinda grows on you. He reminds me of Juvenile. It's content is not original, but Chingy makes it his own with a relaxed flow and style. (4) Young Gunz "Can't Stop, Won't Stop" C. If this standard work is what Roca-A-Fella has in it's post-Jay-Z future,the label is going to be in real trouble. They're good, but they have to be better than good to stand on their own.  (5) Westside Connection feat. Nate Dogg "Gangsta Nation" B+. It was nice to see Westside together again. The style and talent cover up for the somewhat standard material. At the bare minimum, the song is stylistic and very enjoyable.    (6) Ja-Rule "Clap Back" D. This anti-Eminem dis is just border line pathetic and lame. Any Eminem song is a bigger hit and better than Ja Rule's weak new stuff. If Ja Rule wants to return to his position "Pain Is Love" brought him to, he must work much harder.     (7) Kanye West "Through The Wire" C. Kanye West has enjoyed chart success through alot of hype, but I find this song to be very pedestrian for rap. The lyrics don't define Kanye as an original rapper, and the use Chaka Kahn's "Through The Fire" doesn't make a very appealing beat.   (8) Gang Starr "Skills" C. The group isn't that good to begin with, and this song has none of the fun that "Militia" had. Gang Starr has a decent, hardcore sound that needs to be refined in order to define themselves.(9) J-Kwon "Tipsy" B-.This song is fun to listen to, but that still does not make it any better than average. It's not really about anything and gets kinda tiresome towards the end; you may be looking at your watch. He's too overpraised.       (10) E-40 feat. Clipse "Quarterbackin" C+. The track is enjoyable but was never that popular and is pretty forgetable. E-40 and Clipse just aren't that talented. It almost feels as if it was made strictly for the "Madden Football" video games".(11) Fabolous feat. Tamia "Into You" A. Just great, hip hop with style and substance. It's so nice to hear a gentler, more positive hip-hop songs; one that doesn't hammer the listener, but brings out emotions lightly. He is one of the best rappers of 2003; with both his album and it's singles.(12) T.I. "Be Easy" C-. He has been compared to Jay-Z and Nelly; despite the difference that he lacks the talent those artists have. Plain, boring, generic rap from an artist who ofers nothing new to the game; no more needs to be said. One must also wonder why this was chosen over his bigger (not exactly better though) hits "Rubber Band Man" and "Let's Get Away".       (13) Cassidy feat. R. Kelly "Hotel" B-. A sorta fun track, R. Kelly does as much as possible, but he even he can't make Cassidy sound original. To be honest, this was a huge Top 10 hit though; so it kinda does belong here. (14) Ying Yang Twins feat. Lil' Jon  the East Side Boyz "Salt Shaker" B+. Surprisingly, the beat and production make this song rather entertaining. It's much more fun than it has the right to be; given the non-spectacular artists involved.(15) Scarface "Recognize" C-. Scarface used to be an exceptional rapper, but now he's trying to regain glory that is no longer his. Why listen to this, when you could just buy his older albums?      (16) The Untouchables featuring Benzino "Relationship With Me  My Gun" C-.Just a standard Benzino track tacked on for shameless self-promotion. I wouldn't mind so much if the songt had actually been worth listening to. Atleast "Bang Ta Dis" on "Vol.5" was a good song. Bottom Line: *1/2. Benzino has ruined the once great Source series in the blink of an eye. If you want to hear a great Source album, buy "Hip Hop Hits Vol.4"; a Source album with the BIGGEST AND BEST raps of 2000. A few good tracks are not enough to balance out all the mediocre ones. To put it in short terms: with so many good compilations out there, why spend money on a bad one? I would not buy this album with a gift card.  
There's nothing outrageous about the title song - it's a lame, mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the "In the Zone" album: Imagine "Breathe on Me", "Touch of My Hand" or "Shadow" on constant radio play or running on MTV. And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury. For nothing. Fortunately for this single, it's got the already legendary "Toxic" and a marvelous vocal mix version of "Everytime" - another star for that.  
Released by Atlantic five years after it appeared in Australia, presumably to meet high demand for AC/DC's music, this international version of "DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP" is a farce. Once again, somebody had the rather strange ideas of altering the song sequence, and replacing both "R.I.P. (rock in peace)" and "Jailbreak", two of the strongest numbers in the album's Aussie version, with T.N.T.'s "Rocker" and "Love at first feel", an OK, if not spectacular song. Ah, and "Problem child", already featured in Atlantic's version of "Let there be rock", is also included in here. The same song in two different "official albums". Marvelous!. Oh yeah, and somebody hired HIPGNOSIS in order to re-design the front and back covers. That was a cute detail, but the Aussie version's covers (classic mid 70's cartoonish artwork) are far more appealing.Who's to blame for this rip off?. Somebody at Atlantic Records?. Some members of AC/DC?. Maybe both?. Who cares anyway?. Once again, now that I've got used to the Aussie album, listening back to this "product" feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated, low quality spirits. Every enthusiastic record collector knows that both Warner Music and Sony Music are serious labels that took, and still take risks, by signing up cutting edge artists and by respecting their will. So, it seems that, with their approval of this re-issue, the surviving members of AC/DC are the ones to blame for this farce to go on, and on, and on ... If this is so ... well ... guys, we, the fans made you filthy rich. We deserve the "real deal", available worldwide, at a "reasonable price". I only give this "product" a 2 star rating, just because "Love at first feel" remains unreleased in Australia. How unusual!.A final word about this re-issue: I don't own it. In the words of Pete Townshend, I "won't get fooled again". In order to get bonus material, you must go through an irritatingly cumbersome Internet gimmick.If Bon Scott (undisputedly the band's most uncompromising member ever), was still alive, I believe things would be different. By the way, if you are interested in the real stuff, please be so kind as to read my review of "DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP" (Import).OTHER ITEMS TO BE AVOIDED: The skimpy "retrospective" EP "'74 JAIBREAK", and "BONFIRE", a rather steep box set in which at least 6 songs are repeated twice, in different versions. None of these titles include all the songs left out by the adulteration of AC/DC's first four Aussie albums
I have *NOT* listened to this album in full. I am, however, completely turned off by the fidelity of all the samples I have just listened to. There's NO excuse for an album sounding that bad in '69. Ghad, there was Zeppelin, Hendrix, Clapton, Miles - who recorded this thing?All musicians on this CD are superlative examples of their mastery of their instruments, but the above reviewers in general are correct. Holdsworth MADE Lifetime along with Tony William's kick-ass drumming, and most probably insisted - perfectionist that he was, and still is - that it *sounded* like something other than a bootleg.Personally, I'd regard this as something a collector should have - it's for a devotee, not for someone trying to access the genre for the first time because the fidelity is just darn terrible - and one of the above reviewers is so correct. It's like Dylan looking for his "Girl From The North Country", or "Knocking on Heaven's Door". At least they let Tony Williams in so he wouldn't sing any more!All gags aside, a dissapointing effort. Overpriced, but one to have if you are a collector. You have to strain to hear the seed of what was to become Holdsworth's version of Lifetime, which I have not forgotten for 30 plus years. A quantum difference in fidelity, and quality of music. I'd rather buy Tony William's Lifetime Collection if I had to make the choice. I'd be tempted to pick this one up on peer to peer if I was desperate... Very UNimpressed
First, here are some general positives about Jaci Velasquez:- She is a very gifted singer. Her vocal range is top-notch - definitely on par with Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera.- She is beautiful. And unlike a previous reviewer, I do not consider the recognition of this attribute to be a sign of shallowness but rather a display of appreciation for feminine beauty. I like beautiful singing voices. I like beautiful women. There's no difference.- She has great spiritual depth. Her music reflects key spiritual themes such as love, faith and joy.Now, here's a critique of the CD:I listened to all the music samples (as you can do as well) and only one song caught my attention - "Lay It Down". The other tracks have too much of a hard rock sound and were too experimental for my taste. But the song "Lay It Down" was different. It sounded more acoustic, more in the style of folk rock - a genre that reflects my personal preference in pop music.I found the sound clip of "Lay It Down" to be intriguing because it reminded me of a hit song in the 1970's - Eric Carmen's "All By Myself", later covered by Celine Dion in 1996. "All By Myself" is a ballad having a soft, understated introductory verse with an explosive chorus. The sample clip of "Lay It Down" appears to be in the same mold. It has a soft, understated introductory verse; however, it seems to lack an explosive chorus. Listen to the sample and hear it for yourself. The introductory verse is closing with the following lyrics:  "All of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans   Are slowly slipping through my folded hands"So far, so good. There's only a piano and a violin accompanying Jaci's soft vocals. Next, the song appears to be moving from the verse to the chorus and you hear the following lyrics:  "So I'm gonna lay it down   I'm gonna learn to trust You now"Now here's a problem. I am expecting to hear the beginning of an emotional outburst - an opportunity for a singer with the pipes of Jaci Velasquez to showcase her voice. But it is not forthcoming. Why? This intrigued me and I wanted to hear the whole song but I did not want to purchase a CD for only one song. Luckily, I discovered that a compilation CD of Jaci Velasquez's best songs was released recently and it contained "Lay It Down". Great! I bought the CD - "On My Knees: The Best of Jaci Velasquez". This is what I discovered after listening to "Lay It Down".- The first time through the verse and the chorus, the song is definitely understated. We simply have the accompaninment of a piano and a violin with Jaci's soft vocals.- The second time through the verse and the chorus, a drum beat is introduced and Jaci begins to let some emotion out beginning in the middle of the verse and when the song moves into the chorus a complete emotional outburst occurs. But somewhat to my dismay, this is not the same voice that I am expecting from Jaci Velasquez. Her voice was more raspy and raw (actually, it was sounding more like Demi Moore or Tara Reid, not that that is necessarily bad). Furthermore, she appeared to be struggling.Is this the same voice that was soaring effortlessly through the stratosphere on songs such as "On My Knees", "Speak For Me", and "Adore"? Is Jaci Velasquez losing her voice?I don't know but I find it very difficult to imagine that a young woman in her mid-20's is losing her voice. She is entering her prime. Barring a health issue, this just doesn't happen."Lay It Down" is actually a pretty good song. In fact, I am almost of the opinion that it may be her best. I certainly find myself listening to this song more than any of her others."Lay It Down" has the same message as the Beatles' classic "Let It Be". The words are different but both songs share the same sentiment. Actually, now that I think of it...they do share a couple of words in common...the words "let it be". Here are the closing lyrics:          "I'm gonna let it be, I'm gonna let it go           I'm gonna lay it down"The essential lesson being conveyed is learning to "let go and let God" - a profound spiritual insight. Something that each of us here is learning.This song is heartfelt and gut-wrenching. And though her voice is struggling through it, the song, nevertheless, works out its magic. I gave this CD 2 stars because I think Jaci Velasquez is attempting to redefine her music style and has not succeeded. Interestingly enough, her best sound was her first CD - Un Lugar Celestial (A Heavenly Place). Bring back the spanish/flamenco guitar and develop a more acoustic sound. In my opinion, the acoustic sound is more spiritual. Keep the piano and electric bass guitar but dispense with the hard rock electric guitar and synthesized sound effects. Develop a Latin folk rock sound with an element of jazz. Hire a good saxophonist or a trumpet player. Emphasize ballads. That should do the trick
I read several different on-line reviews for this CD before I purchased it. Each seemed to imply that this CD was a new direction for Jaci, that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature. Strange. I must have purchsed the Prozac copy of this CD because there is nothing new here from her. Like my title line to this review states, it's the exact same music she has always sang, just in a different package. Now the CD just collects dust. What a shame
Don't think Dale can play a song the same way twice. Didn't like the selection of songs nor  the  way they produced.
Unlike most other items I've bought from Amazon, I failed to read the reviews for this particular CD before purchasing.  Being a fan of the Final Fantasy series, I think I fell into a bit of the "fanboy" (well in my case, "fangirl" I guess) syndrome.  Also I didn't do my homework at all and thought this was an orchestrated recording, which it most certainly is not.I own most of the Final Fantasy OST's (and heartily endorse them for fans of the games) and this particular CD does nothing new or compelling to the music.  Tracks 1-7 are pretty much carbon copies of their OST counterparts.  Track 8, the opening theme of FFVIII (Liberi Fatali) has a very odd synth-solo vocal mix covering what is in the original a very moving choral section.  Tracks 9-11 again are basically copies of the OST.  Track 12, "Alexandria (Vivi's Theme)" is the only somewhat-original track, as it seems to put together several pieces from the FFIX soundtrack in a medley of sorts.Unless you are a rabid fan who must have everything FF, I recommend saving up and purchasing the real OST's instead of this disc.  While I don't see non-fans flocking to purchase this disc, it might be worthwile if you're only slightly interested in the series and want a taste.  Even in that event I'd be worried this disc would turn those people off from the series entirely.Pros:  Cheap (I paid $6, new)Track 12 is worth a listenCons:Tracks 1-7, 9-11 offer nothing much new or differentTrack 8 has creepy (in a bad way) synth/voice mixe
Ok......AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!! As luck would have it I found it a a garage sale.  The only track whorth listening to is track 12 which is ViVi's Theme from FF9.  The others well....They could have done better.  Most of the songs are to put it nicely......SUCK (At least the way they where done).  The only reason I rated 2 (1 1/2 to be accualy) is because of ViVi's Theme at the end.  This is not whorth your time.  Get the imported CD's they have much better music on them
I bought 4 of their cd's from amazon after hearing the song "bad days" in a batman movie. This cd is the worst of the 4 i bought. Not one good song. Totally lame. I'm not even going to stick someone else with it. I'm just going to throw it out
These guys were the nirvana of r,motown, soul, black music in the 90s. As nirvanawas the band that ended good white music.boyz to men was the band that ended good black music.I am kinda pissed because nobody seems to noticeit like i do. These guys especially the lead singer would always sing, oh wah oh wah oh oh ohhh oh after every sentence.I mean compare these guys to kool and the gang or the commodores or rick james.i could name tons and im not really a fan of soul type music.barry white, whitney houston, bobby brown, the temptationsIsaac hayes luther vandross.  i mean in the 90s i think almost every r group wasbetter than boyz to girls. i dont understand whythese guys are so popular.I guess its just like seinfeld it sucks badbut people like it. its like all these idiotswere born yesterday forgetting about qualitymusic and sitcoms from the past that were better. 
Gerry Marsden and his Pacemakers are great.  I just want to point out that the double-CD 'Best of' Import has 15 extra tracks and sells for about the same price.  There is just no reason to buy this compilation instead of the import
The problem with America was that started out great.  The first album was fresh and different from everything.  Three young boys and accoustic quitars was a song all it own.  "Horse with no name" and "SandMan", was what pave the way for them.  The problem was that each album after that they got farther away from their roots and into the middle of mainstream pop. They should of left "Muskrat Love." to the Captain and Tennille.This album does a fine job of showing their career from beginning to end.  The problem was that there was their first two albums, ( America and Venture Highway) and there was their others.My recommandation would be to pick up the first 2 and leave this for the die hard fans
I bought this CD only yesterday.The recording level is too low and I could not listen to the performance even with the volume cranked fully up.Rather than going in for another high wattage amplifier I decided to return the CD!!
Well, the labels did it again. First, when they released the album "Dream" on cd. Their biggest hit from that album "You never done it like that" turned out to be a re-recorded version on the cd release.They did it again with this "Ultimate Collection." That being said, I love some of their other hits, especially "The way that I want to touch you." Luckily, the rest of the tracks are the originals. If you're looking for the original version of "You never done it like that", you would have to get the 20th Century Masters collection of theirs
It's not as good as his other albums.  He tries too hard and he praises himself way too much.  Poor guy; no wonder it had a fake case
I'm sorry to vent on the Stylistics, certainly others are guilty of this, but $33 to get all the Stylistics hits is WAY too expensive.  Sorry, love the Stylistics, and the Spinners too (whose double CD anthology is around $30 too).  Why is something like Lionel Richie and the Commodores 2CD Gold $13.99?  Oh well... I'll wait
With the greatest respect to the incredible Bob Beldon, Joe Zawinul, and Wayne Shorter, this Box Set should contain a warning.The warning is simple: If you already own most of the stuff in this collection, don't bother. If you're completely new to Weather Report, buy it.Coming from someone that's seen the band perform every year since 1972 and own all their official and quite a few "other" releases, I was really disappointed with this project (except for the booklet).Here are a few things that are puzzling:1) A Weather Report Box Set includes three songs (two composed by Zawinul and one by Shorter) that were never released by Weather Report:a. In a Silent Way. released by Miles Davisb. Super Nova, released by Wayne Shorterc. Experience in E (Excerpt), released by Cannonball Adderly(I agree with the liner notes that point to these songs as pre-cursors, but mentioning them would have been enough - they are all in print)2) An incredible typo stating that Alphonse Mouzon was the drummer on "Unknown Soldier"3) Including a barely improved version of Nubian Sundance that has been in circulation for many years from "other" sources. 4) Including another "better than, but not by much" version of the "other" sources for the 1978 Rockpalast concert on DVD. 5) Not remastering any of the original recordings. The tape hiss from the Live in Tokyo (I Sing the Body Electric) songs is still clearly heard and not upgrading those old recordings is just plain unacceptable in this day and age.  6) Finally, the cover itself - I have no words, except to admit "I don't get it".Having said all that negative stuff - Weather Report remains the dominant "creative machine" of the Jazz Rock Fusion era and those that missed it should buy this without hesitating. If you're a long time Weather Report fan - there's absolutely nothing to get excited about here. The DVD was especially disappointing to me. I have had that concert on VHS tape for many years and now on DVD (all from "other" sources) and was shocked to see such incredible video noise on the official version. Zawinul's black and white keys look like polka-dots in many places. (I played the DVD in 5 different players; two TV's and my computer monitor to make sure it wasn't my equipment).  I should have paid attention to the PR person at Sony that told me the concert was taken from a re-broadcast of the show and NOT from the master tapes. It's my own fault for having unrealistic expectations. I should probably clarify that while the DVD is in fact clearly better than the "un-offical" version, IT STILL LOOKS LIKE A BOOTLEG! Sad...It is of some significance that this "review" is the first time I've chosen to speak out about something in Fusion that was less than flattering. It should also be noted that my disappointment is aimed directly at CBS/Sony/BMG and not the musicians/producers. I'm still amazed that this record company can see fit to release this and hold back the already remastered Mahavishnu Orchestra Live in Cleveland Cd that was supposed to be released in 2004. Lastly, let me make it perfectly clear that Zawinul, Shorter, and Beldon are musicians and people I personally hold in the highest esteem with Zawinul and Shorter being musical divinities as far as I'm concerned. While my review is an obvious personal venting, and I realize that Zawinul and Shorter gave this project their stamp of approval, I think that shouldn't be mistaken for a personal attack. My remarks are simply observations with some attitude directed at CBS/Sony/BMG. By Rick CalicJazz Rock World
As a peripheral BNL fan, I have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out.  With previous releases, I have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings.  This cd got stale fast.  Seems to be geared to the tween crowd.  I am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the BNL I have enjoyed in years past
This CD and the one entitled" Night Ranger's Greatest Hits are almost identical, but are different in this way:"Best" contains "I Did It For Love". "Greatest" contains, instead, "Rumours In The Air" and "Restless Kind". The other 10 tracks on each CD are the same. So, which one to buy? My choice is the one with the extra track. Also, in my opinion, both tracks on "Greatest" are better than the one on "Best".In addition, here's hoping that the band or record label decides to release a true "Greatest Hits" or "Best Of" album that will contain about 15 or 16 songs. Or maybe a multi-disc compilation that will include some rare tracks. Night Ranger fans would surely delight to see something like that
I thought it would have nice, soft songs. But, it is riddled with annoying sound effects and strange instrumentation
Hey folks, this is brilliant and all, like the articles say, but what they don't mention is that it's impossible to listen to. There are no verses, choruses, or even beats to speak of. There are no songs. It's just a sound collage or something, from start to finish. The booklet prints lyrics but I couldn't find 'em. This music is too brilliant for its own good. And you can forget about using it as party or background music. JDub's other offerings are much better
I RECEIVED A CD, THE TANGO CD( THE BEST TANGO ALBUM IN THE WORLD EVER) WAS DEFECTUOUS, SINCE IT PLAYS ALRIGHT  UNTIL THE 12TH SONG, BUT THEN THE SONGS STARTS GIVING WEIRD TONES. AND THE 2ND CD ACTS THE SAME WAY, SINCE MY TANGO ALBUM IS A DOUBLE CD.THE PROBLEM IS NOT FROM THE RADIO, SINCE MY OTHER PURCHASE FROM AMAZON IS IN GOOD SHAPE, AS AL MY OTHER CDS.THE MUSIC ALWAYS STOPS PLAYING RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME OF THE CD, THE 12 TH SONG, SO ITS PRETTY MUCH A CD PROBLEM.I DUNNO WHATS THE REFUND POLICY, OR CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER, ITS SO BAD , COS THIS TANGO CD IS GREAT. I ENJOYED IT MUCH , UNTIL.........TH
I love this show!  That said, I do not care for this version of it.  The inclusion of the word "concept" in the title means it is just that.  This was, thankfully, not the final version of the show that would later spawn the hit song, "One Night In Bangkok".With most Broadway musicals, the musical numbers tell the basic story of the show.  If you listen to the recordings of Phantom, Mama Mia, Beauty and the Beast, you can discern the basic storyline of the show.  Listening to this particular recording of Chess, though, will leave you wondering "What was that?"  The Broadway arrival of Chess saw a much needed reworking of the storyline and arrangement of the musical numbers.  This recording seems too much like a mish-mash of songs that don't really relate to each other.For musical fanatics (like myself), I say "yes, you should have this recording in your collection", if only to understand how much work went into the show before it opened on Broadway.If you are only buying the album because of "One Night In Bangkok", purchase the Broadway recording instead; you'll be much happier with the performance by Phillip Casnoff rather than Murray Head
My 8 year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this CD for Christmas.  It is advertised as the Cheetah Girls 2 - however these vocals are not sung by the original Cheetah Girls who are in the movie.  The songs just don't sound the same.  It's very dissappointing that Disney doesn't tell you this on the CD
I bought this disc hoping for pristine remastered sound and what I got was shrill noise with all the hiss sucked out. The guy who typed a review in all caps is a moron! It's better than an MFSL disc because the artist approved it? Yeah right! Get real! I might need a new hi-fi if I don't like the sound? Please! You idiots know nothing about what good sound quality is and either does Peter Mew or Rob Caiger. Thanks for nothing!Sony should be sued by people who bought this horrible disc for deceptive practices...saying that the full-length version of "Roll Over Beethoven" was used! What a crock! And so what if they used the original master tapes? Using a master tape doesn't mean anything if you're going to smother it in noise processing and master it poorly! Don't buy this disc! Hang onto the old US versions, or even better, the Japanese issue. Don't give Sony your money for this shambles of a product
Hey, BRRRRRUUUUUCCCE!What's the deal? Just about every major Top 40 artist has had their catalogs sonically updated EXCEPT YOURS.Why can we buy the "Tracks" editions, and get glorious HDCD-encoded sound, but "Town" sounds like it's coming out an AM radio?OK, you did your best, but Dubya's back in the White House for the next four years, and Kerry's home in his underwear watching the Weather Channel. You should have plenty of time on your hands now... GET BUSY!Let's see some remastering!
Just be sure to read up on this closely... it's not the orchestra you hear in the movie, and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts - gone are great talents Enya and Annie Lennox, replaced by no-name voices.  This is not BAD music, but don't think you're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2-CD set
Something that someone who claims to be COUNTRY should NOT do. Even though these girls are already pop, remixing it to make it even more pop was a HUGE mistake! Then again, they have to do something to sell more cd's! LOL!!
The best scene in the movie is the Italian restaurant scene with Janeane Garofalo, using a wry Randy Quaid as her foil when she's not ignoring him.  It's the only scene that made me laugh.The scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home, and the one preceding it when his girlfriend's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids, are both weak.  Playboy dad is not interesting, and that character really shouldn't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie.The other dad, Reiser, is uncomfortable to watch.  His dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter, but that too is uncomfortable to watch.  The later scene, up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him, is completely unbelievable.  The fact is, that particular girl would not say those things to her dad.  She doesn't love him.  She doesn't need him at all.  She's done with him.The stupid bit about Randy Quaid being a talk show star after busting into Rob Reiner's talk show is just dumb.  That doesn't happen.  If you want to write a cartoon, get Warner Brothers to draw it for you.  Have the Road Runner in it, or Bugs Bunny.The film gives us comfort food at the end, with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids.  The fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young, but once they hit a certain age, in double digits, you are done.  Daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on.  Kids in their teens and twenties don't want or need anything but money from dad.  Fittingly, I saw this film on Father's Day.To sum the whole movie up, Janeane Garofalo is funny, Randy Quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end, and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying.  The script doesn't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on.  But it takes a subject on, so at least that's something.  It gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family
This is a saccharine and banal take on Irish music, with all the emotional intesity of a Hummel figuraine.  Upon first listen, I remarked to my wife that they sounded more like Peter, Paul, and Mary than the Dubliners. She correctly pointed out that Peter, Paul, and Mary were actually much better than this pablum, and that the Irish Rovers more closely resemble the fictional Main Street Singers from a Mighty Wind. Truly, absolutely, unlistenably passionless, cloying and bland
this album is dull and without any emotion.the only reason this guy is even known is because of his backgroud
I love running to the Marine Corps Cadence CDs.  Volumes 1 and 2 are very good.  Volume 3 sounds studio produced and more choral.  When running vols 1  2 are better synched for continuous running.  The transitions on vol 3 feel out of synch to me.  Others don't seem to agree and I still run to this CD;  I'd buy 1 and 2 first if you don't have them
I like these guys alot.I own a bunch of there stuff and love to see them live. I played this Cd a few times liked it at first, but it didn't grow on me at all liked I'd hoped.To cute for me,not spontaneous enough.I feel this cd will be just another dust collector in a short period of time.Just let it rip guys,that's what you do best.Thank god my brother bought this instead of me.I bought live at cow palace (The Dead) great Cd
I first heard the song on the radio en route to work. I enjoyed it immensely and wanted to know who did the remake.  No Doubt's redo of the 80's hit brought back good memories of the new wave era. But, of course, it does not compare to the original Talk Talk version
THIS IS JUNK NOT MUSIC.NEON MOON IS THE WORST SONG EVER!IT IS SO BORING AND DULL.AND A COOL DRINK OF WATER IS A HORRIBLY WRITTEN AND SUNG SONG!THIS MUSIC BORES ME!LEAVE IT ALONE AND STICK TO RAP,ROCK,OR METAL.COUNTRY SUCKS
  Paul Brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music. However, content on his latest project, "White Sand" isn't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums. The artist collaborations on "White Sand" make it tempting to purchase, but you quickly realize Brown's musical wittiness and versatility (Smooth, Latin or R) are lacking. Overall it is still a CD worth paying for
  Get off the drugs, guys. Your reviews made me purchase this awful load of tripe. While proficient enough on the instruments and vocals, The Moon falls woefully short just about everywhere else. The songs sound very similar to one another and are all pretty much void of any decent melodies or even a good hook or two. Right when it seems they might be getting somewhere, they break the rhythm and make a feeble attempt to psych it up or out with a sitar, swirling strings or the ever constant and really abused minor key chord changes. There is also a curious lack of any decent choruses, here. I have to believe that that was a conscious effort on the part of The Moon. Bad idea, guys. And while the music is pretty lame, the lyrics are absolutely wretched. Can anyone out there, after listening to this, remember more than ten words from any song on this washed out CD? If you can, it's because they're so lame and uninspiring. The lyrics from The Temptations' "Psychadelic Shack" captures the feeling of the sixties better than anything these blotterheads came up with.Here's a big hint about the musical contents of this CD. It actually says on the front cover, "Featuring David Marks of The Beach Boys." Huh??? Is that supposed to be a ringing endorsement?Comparing these guys to Left Banke, The Zombies or The Beatles is pure blasphemy! For those of you fortunate enough to NOT have heard The Moon before, count your lucky stars. If you feel yourself slipping to the dark side (the boneheads giving this 4 or 5 stars) and feel like spending some extra cash, there are other sixties groups more worthy of your money, like the aforementioned bands.  I'm probably going to piss some people off with this review, but that's exactly how I felt after giving this CD a listen. Honestly, I immediately thought of George Harrison's less than stellar second rate efforts while listening to this. I love ya George, but you put out more than one clinker of a northern song. If bad Harrison's your thing......well, then stop reading and buy this CD now! For the rest of you, there's a lot of music from somewhat obscure sixties bands coming out on CD right now. Garage or psych, a lot of it is great, but the mine is also getting stipped pretty bare. The Moon is proof positive. It's also pretty easy to see why their recording company called it quits after two albums - and the second album is far superior to the first in both sound and content! In closing, while this album has overwhelming intracasies layered into the music and vocals, the end product is very bland. I read these guys admitted to cutting these songs while under the influence of LSD. It shows! I rated this "aural adventure" two stars, instead of one, for two reasons. First, I kept rooting for these guys to come up with a decent song to salvage the album (actually two). They never did, but at least they performed all original songs. It's also worth an added star to see a rerelease from a sixties band that doesn't have a cover of "Hey Joe" on it. If you're still with me (and also a lover of good music or even mediocre fare), avoid this CD like the plague! I'd also like to thank Amazon for putting this clinker on my recommendation lists. You done me wrong
I was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as Rhapsody (name changed due to copyright issues) on their 2006 live album Live in Canada. I have to say that I am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort. The group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music. The vocals tend to be oversung, or drowned out by the chaos in the background. Rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements, Rhapsody of Fire puts you to sleep with them. The group does stay true to their fantasy themes however
never shipped. I ordered this before Christmas. They said it was in stock. WHERE IS IT
I do not like Parker's style at all.  I can't really say anything else.  It is all in the way you format a song, and I just don't like parker
Another unspeakable album from the most unspeakably overwrought, over-produced and over-rated rock band of all time.  Did I mention over the top? Let's face it, Queen was a group of crypto-fascists, working hard to put a human face on Thatcherism.  Ghastly stuff.K.
Imagine buying this CD after seeing "The Mirror has Two Faces" fully expecting the SOUNDTRACK music to the movie, and reading overall great reviews on Amazon.  Imagine the shock of receiving the CD and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - The remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse. Perhaps Barbara, with her tremendous unlimited wealth, felt she would be giving away a "free album" to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film. Shameless misrepresentation
It seems that other than a song or two, Fall Out Boy forgot their guitar's.  Very disappointing and slow paced
I remember buying a record by DNA when it first came out...and I was really surprised later when arto lindsay and the ambitious lovers were able to turn this mess into great music. This is very unprofessiona
Modern usually sounds like some outdated mid-80s new wave album by the Cars, Flock of Seagulls, or somesuch.  It is not a punk record, mostly midtempo pop.  The three songs Diggle wrote and sings on are  basically awful; Shelley's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics  and great hooks.  I would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch  Buzzcocks stuff; newbies should buy Operator's Manual or  Going Steady.  Or dig up the amazing Different Kind of  Tension from a used record store somewhere!  Also, see them live if  you have a chance
I think they should place a disclaimer at the top advising would be buyers that Rosemary Clooney does not perform on this CD. It lacks the romance and magic without her. I wish I had read the reviews of this CD before purchasing it, but I was so excited to see the White Christmas Soundtrack on CD that I just one-clicked it
As a 21 year old, I felt a little out of place buying this soundtrack.  But, I was so excited that I had finally found a soundtrack to these two wonderful movies.  Imagine my disappointment when I could aurally pick out that Rosemary Clooney's parts were not sung by Rosemary Clooney!  I DO NOT recommend buying this album.  Enjoy the music when you watch the movies, instead.  Trust me, it's better that way
Think twice before purchase:1. Most of the good tracks are available on the non-copy protected "All-Time Top 100 TV Themes", along with the best themes from other networks.2. This disc has CDS-100 copy protection, so you probably can't upload to Windows Media and definitely not to iTunes.I could not upload from my internal CD drive, only from an external multi-format CD/DVD burner. It still only uploaded to Windows Media, not iTunes.To get into iTunes, I had to add the WMA files and then convert them to MP3.This probably caused some quality loss as I'm converting one compressed format to another compressed format!A time-consuming and tedious process which could have been avoided altogether if music companies would get over this fixation on "controlling" everything.Hello record execs: If nobody can add your discs to their libraries, guess what happens? They DON'T PLAY YOUR MUSIC!!!You might think you're protecting your valuable investment, but you're shooting yourself in the foot instead. Here's how it goes:1. Nobody can upload your music.2. Nobody plays your music.3. Nobody hears your music.4. Nobody recommends your music.5. Nobody buys your music.Remember, this only loaded from a particular kind of drive, so it may or may not work on yours.As Bela Lugosi would say: Bevare
this is a great album and a great artist with albert king theres no going wrong when you buy one of his albums. he is the king of electric-blues. you can hear all these songs in great format. just awsome playing awsome singing. its sure no wonder srv. and hendrix really loved albert king
It just amazes me what a joke the music industry has become. Nowadays anyone can become a singer take for instance: Ashlee Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, and now Paris Hilton? LMAO! No seriously though, I'm still totally not sure how Paris Hilton became so famous. Yes, I know she's the Hilton Hotel Heiress, but I'm not sure why the media gives her so much attention. All she did was live off her family fortune, but now thanks to that fortune, she was able to get the right contacts, to make her own record label called "heiress records" which is a sub-label of Warner Bros. After a reality show series, modeling career, A sex tape, and a couple of roles in a few movies, what did she think to herself? I think I want to be a singer now? Apparently. And thats how this flaming pile of garbage came about. "Stars are Blind" is her first single off her debut album "Paris" and let me tell you it's nothing new or original. The song has kind of a ska beat, which I really don't think much of. Her voice sounds like when you inhale helium from a balloon, and the lyrics are mediocre. Sorry Paris , but you failed miserably as a musician. Leave this profession for the people that really have the talent
I bought Usher's 8701 on tape long ago, and I remember liking it. Then a couple of years ago, I bought it again on cd, listened to it, and wondered why I wasted my money.Maybe it's the fact that I've grown, but this album sounds so un-soulful now. It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt, don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now.Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves 3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it.
Bread8, that's one of the stupidest comments I've ever read.  You don't know s*** about metal.  You can't handle the intensity of real metal because you're a fat virgin who'd cry to your mommy if you heard godly metal songs like "Immortal Rites" and "Pleasure to Kill."  Leave the metal to the metalheads you mallcore f@ggot.Anyway, "Dysfunction is better than Staind's other stuff, but only by a microscopic margin.  Aaron Lewis is a weak, talentless crybaby whose bandmates couldn't make a good song to save their lives.  Every song on here is full of bogus "pain" and "depression" coupled with abyssmal musicianship just like every other nu-metal band.If you want heavy music that's accessible for the masses, go for Rage Against the Machine (except for "Evil Empire"), Faith No More, Helmet, Living Colour, and Quicksand.
Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly"
I am  a cellist of 15 years on the breakthrough of becoming a renowed cellist. This cellist tone is so powerfull and clear.she tells a story this is so clear to understand because the music speaks. alisa should watch the slurs from the f to b and be more gracefull. The apres un reve was ok i guess. she really should of tooken more time. like floating on a dream cloud. when i play this piece i take the music from the begining as a fuzzy dream and play the pitch so the music tells a story and becomes more clear every measure. The elgar is somenthing she might not want to touch because no one plays it better than du pre
She does sound like a goat bleating. Yodeling. It's a shame, really.
I was literally horrified when I first put this album in my cd player.  This cd is absolutly terrible, every song sounds like its been composed for some middle school band to play.  Furthermore the songs hardly sound like the songs they represent, they'll go through like one riff from the origional then just do their own thing. Do not, i repeat, do not purchase this album. I was expecting some cool, fun, funky lounge music but this cd is just obnoxious. The only thing that makes this cd remotley worth purchasing is the cool album art and free coaster
Pls tell me tat tis BoxSet is a JOKE!!!! Classic Rock - REO, Romantics ... BANGLES??? its more like Classic New Wave. Only thing good would be the price. Pls ... who ever the AR people are ... pls ... pls ... design something bette
Whomever decided on putting this box set together must have been smoking crack.  Since when did 8675309/jenny become a classic rock hit?  Are you kidding me....come on!  No Hendrix,Floyd,Zeppelin.  Classic rock my arse
This is What you want (1983) was a terrible album from John Lydon and Martin Atkins.  After an rift between Keith Levene and John Lydon occured during the recording of the demo tracks, Atkins and Lydon ran Keith off and he quit the band.  Instead of keeping him on the finished tracks, Atkins and Lydon removed Levene and Pete Jones (the band's studio bassist) from the audio tracks and re-recorded themwith members from their Holiday Inn band (Lydon hired members from a covers band who performed at a New Jersey Holiday Inn).  The new tracks and horrible.  All of the guitar riffs and rhythmsection that were originally recorded for the future album were erased.  Noise and other unwelcomed sounds were added to the tracks.  The original tracks were far superior (even in their basic state) to what was released.  To hear them you'll have to find the Commercial Zone LP.  The failure of this disc and the bickering between Atkins and Lydon would cause the band to become a solo project for the former anarchy king.Not recommended
read the the second reveiw from the bottom that says a music fan from the east coast. the olny good song on this cd is fly
Made another bull**** album. Honestly I didn't hear this whole album. About 5 years ago I was ridin wit one of my boys and he played this cd. Oh my god for the first time in my life I wished I was deaf. I see the reason why her albums sell though. Cause its her looks and nothin else. She's not ugly at all to me. She just can't sing. But she can livin up a crowd. I'm just waitin to see her and 50 cent doin a song together, two of the worst people in music, millionaires. Go figure
This album lacks a lot of the controversy (not all of it) of the original,  uncensored Cop Killer (new censored version now titled Body  Count). Go to eBay and find someone auctioning off the real version of the  92 album. You will like it a hell of a lot better
THIS WAS FOR A FRIEND AND I HAVE NO FEEDBAC
Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins. It's all supposed to convey the drama, intrigue and relevance of a TV show (Survivor Yell, Mud Bath, Chase Race, Tally the Vote, I Can See It, Buzzed) with no drama, intrigue and relevance. A desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television
The only reason I picked up this album was the name Norah Jones.  I was expecting to hear her at the forefront, and I didn't really.  To be honest, I was hoping to hear more of what she sounded like in Come Away With Me and Feels Like Home.  If you're looking for Norah Jones, this isn't really the album you're looking for
this guy sounds worse than brian johnson does now. why can't people my age stop copying the past? be original. that's it. this style is well worn out.
If you are buying this because you love Rob, be aware this is the Rob wearing his Goblin Cock hat.  If you aren't familiar with this incarnation...let's just say it ain't the Rob of Pinback or Heavy Vegetable fame.  Same guy, different sensitivity.I fell in love with Rob because he seemed to make sense out of all the nonsense out there.  On this outing, Rob has met the enemy and it is himself.  He's entitled to do as he pleases and you and I are entitled to not care for it.  This CD is not an acquired taste, it is a forced-feeding
This lifts your heart to God as you listen.  Beautifully done
ALL OF THE SONGS ARE BORING. I HATE THEM. THEY ARE SLOW AND BORING AND THEY MAKE YOU WANT TO FALL ASLEEP
Don't waste your money.  This album is cheesy, sounds like a million other pop rock songs, and is nothing compared to their earlier work.  With Donnie Van Zant and Max Carl on vocals, all I have to say is:  they need the old  lead singer back!  The guitar work is ok, but the classic .38 Special sound  has definitely been lost
This album sounds to much like Pop music than hardcore Reggaeton. They even have that RBD boyband in this piece. A few years ago LT saved Reggaeton with their producing skills now it looks like they set out to kill the monster they created with this embarrasing album transforming a music of the streets into the music even Grandmas like and that is scary. The only reason for the two star is because the zion and the arcangel  de la ghetto songs. If you wanna hear some real Reggaeton look for producers like DJ Memo, Meka, Mambo Kings, DJ Wassie  DJ Fat this dudes are doin it right and keepin Reggaeton Calle my friend
Like so many new-age artists, Ryan Farish has a great ear for melodies. Unlike most new-age artists, Ryan Farish has rhythmic problems. He likes to use the delay effect on his piano, but either it is not sycronized with the tempo of the song or he is simply being too sloppy with his playing (sometimes it's one problem and sometimes it's both). I don't know how he let those takes make it on to the final album. Also, the massively loud reverse cymbal sounds are way overused and make the entire album very abrasive very quickly
2nd time.
This tribute was announced almost ten years ago, and it seems to have undergone a transformation since then.  To be fair, there are some interesting additions such as the Sufjan Stevens and Brad Mehldau tracks.  And Emmylou Harris is brilliant.  But Sarah McLachlan's "Blue" has been heard before as has Prince's "A Case of You."  Earlier reports indicated contributions from heaviweights like Steely Dan and Lindsey Buckingham.  I sure would like to have heard what they would have done.  Even more disappointing is that Joni's Hejira-Mingus era albums are mostly ignored - and that was her best music, in my opinion.  As a final indignity, it sounds to me that too much compression was added in the mastering phase, and hence the overall sound quality of the CD is lacking in dynamics.
This album is very weak compared to his earlier efforts.  The music is simple and straightforward, and the rapping is poor
Being an Osmond fan can be very frustrating at times...  This CD has nothing new to offer.  There have been several Osmond compilation CDs in the past 10 years.  What's so different about this one besides the photograph on the cover?  Nothing.  I agree with the reviewer who wishes the Osmonds would put some of their old albums on CD instead of putting out hit compilation CDs all the time.  Been there.  Done that.  Bored to tears
The quality of this CD recording sounds like someone tapped it in their garage and burned it to CD with thier personal PC. Very bad recording. It's too bad because Lathleen Madigan is very witty and funny.
Somehow not up to her earlier work. The instrumental accompaniment is good, but tends to dominate at the expense of Cesaria's voice and the songs don't strike me as particularly memorable. One reviewer said this was perhaps the best thing she's done. If so, I just don't see it. I was disiappointed and found myself wondering if maybe her best days are behind her. I hope not
As a huge Counting Crows fan, I thought it was kinda cool when I came across a tribute album to them...right up until the time that I listened to the cd. It is nearly impossible to get through. The best way I can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke. I rated it one star because there's no "0 star" option. If you have any intentions of buying this cd, find a website where you can preview it first, and thank me later
If you don't have the blues,this record will give them to you.Musically speaking ,it's tripe
I SAW THIS MOVIE 'CAUSE I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE CATHY RIGBY, "WHO WAS BORN TO PLAY PETER PAN". I HATED IT A LOT. SO, NOW I AM IN A HIGH SCHOOL PRODUCTION OF PETER PAN, AND I HAPPEND TO SEE THE MARY MARTIN VERSION, AND THE MARY MARTAIN CD. I LOVED IT! THEN I REALIZED THAT 'PETER PAN' IS NOT A BAD MUSICAL AT ALL. CATHY RIGBY AND THE "CREW" WERE MAKING IT BAD. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY THINK CATHY RIGBY IS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD. DON'T BELIEVE THEM. SHE ISN'T. SHE SOUNDED LIKE SHE WAS A STUIPED LITTLE BRAT THAT JUST WANTED TO ROT THE REST OF HIS [HER] TIME JUST SITTING IN A DARK CORNER CARVING FORKS WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, MARY MARTAIN SOUNDS ALL CHEERFUL, FUN, AND REAL. I RECCOMEND MARY MARTAIN'S VIDEO AND CD. I SAY NO MORE
I am a hater, to the core. I hate Puffy and thats all it is to it. Now there, you don't have to say it.So on to the review.First off every lyrical line Puffy spit in this album was outdone by everybody. Every track he had the weakest flow and the worst rhymes. And thats the truth. I don't know how true this is, but I heard Loon was behind most of Puffy's lines on this album. So that should explain the utter wackness in his lyrics. The truth is I don't care who writes his lines. It could be Tupac and Nas doin it, since its not them spittin it, then it actually takes away from the rhymes itself. Almost this entire album is filler. The best tracks is Real N**** and journey through my life. I really didn't feel that beat a whole lot but Nas and Beanie's verses was off the hook. However that is not enough for me to give this album more than one star. Now I love MC Lyte and Public Enemy, but they should get smacked in the back of they heads with crowbars for lettin him mutilate their classics. Thats not musical artistry, thats butcher work. Fake Thug dedication really gets under my skin. The title alone. No disrespect to Biggie as an artist cause I do like him still. But they put a diss on Tupac on Life after Death after he died, then denied it for years. So perhaps the fake thug dedication should be to him, cause thats some sucker s***. I didn't hear his latest album, I'm not going to review it, I didn't even visit that section. If you a fan of this guy, then you gon cop this and his new one regardless. If you like me and hate just about everything he puts out, you won't be caught within a mile of that s***
I bought this soundtrack in 1984 when the movie adaptation of George Orwell's book came out, simply because it was attached to the movie.  I'll try not to use any non-family words here, but this soundtrack sucks.  Muldowney's original score is available on CD, and simply imagining it used as intended adds a whole new dimension to the movie.  As far as this soundtrack goes, though; skip it
This disc is BAD!!! Right at the 2" mark the sound of the "rock water" is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub. This sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour. Other discs of this type that I've heard don't do this
I opend the CD filled with joy till it started; at the beginning I thought there should be some kind of mistake but no, there were no letters. Not even one word, we couldn't sing at all; we just had the letters printed in very tiny letters but no guide to sing
I do not see how reviewers can rate this guy 5 stars.   His voice is so mediocre that I am suprised he manages to sell many cd's at all.   I wouldn't waste my hard earned cash on this guy.  Stick with Sinatra and get the best.  If not, and you want someone who can sing Sinatra style, then I would recommend you listen to the young Canadian, Michael Buble. In my opinion Michael Buble is a much better singer that Tyrell.  He can swing and do justice to that genre of music
I am wondering WHEN this plague will be over....and WHEN we'll be set free to listen to real music...We all are so tired of her 
E40 is the worst MC i have ever heard i would rather listen to someone drag their nails down a blackboard. How on earth can  someone like him get a record contract and sell records. Anytime he comes on another rappers album no matter how good the beats are I always skip the track
A tenor very quickly on the rise, this is Villazon's second recital disc, one devoted to arias by Gounod and Massenet, all in sets of three, three for Massenet, and two for Gounod.  While still showing great promise, some concerns that were mildly serious with the first disc are even more so, in the French repertoire, in part because diction comes up so short here."O souverain" from Le Cid continues to show Villazon's command of line and squeezed but adequately forceful upper register, so that the volume boosts from the control room are really unnecessary.  Diction here is already an issue, as many `u' vowels get dipthonged, especially when Villazon's sound is placed back for added weight and volume.   `La reve' from Massenet's Manon is comfortably floated, with support from Natalie Dessay as Manon enhancing the intimacy of feeling to this number. Would Villazon been able to sing the short aria by Alain (who appears to the heroine at first to perhaps be little more than an apparition - shades of Frau ohne schatten perhaps? - in almost a chamber opera), from Massenet's Griselidis (track 8), at least as softly and lightly, as both the music and dramatic situation require, this could have also been very successful.  He instead turns the ABA shape of this mere chanson inside out and makes a wreck of it.  The less often excerpted "Lorsque enfant" from Werther closes out the first Massenet set, as does "Pourquoi me reveiller" the second.  Villazon's identification with the distraught main character of this opera is abundantly clear in both.  He capitalizes well on the quixotic emotions and dreamy tendencies of the distraught main character especially well in the first selection, and he is also less intruded upon by the producers or sound engineers there as well.It is quite curious how the control room follows the tenor up a crescendo on a line that closes out the first section of the excerpt here from Massenet's Roi de Lahore, featuring a hero (from Hindu myth) that bound to certain stipulations, has literally returned from the dead.   Not quite as ostentatious as Massenet's near remake of Lohengrin, Esclarmonde (but with female protagonist instead), it is one of Massenet's most colorful scores. It has only been recorded complete once commercially, with Joan Sutherland, Luis Lima, and appearing only ten minutes apart, James Morris, and for the part of General unfortunately eliminated from this scene here, John Tomlinson, along with one other cut to Villazon's part.  It would've been more valuable to have all this complete instead of one or two other arias.  He captures the incipiently worried tone of Alim well, but his coloring up the vowel sounds makes it seem that he has come from a place as remote from French culture as where the opera takes place.Most successful of the Gounod selections are two of the three rarities.  The first is Source delicieuse from Polyeucte, based on the Corneille play.  It opens very well with a minute of orchestral cortege.  It perhaps has only been recorded once before and well, by Roberto Alagna ten years ago; Villazon conveys the heroism of the piece somewhat well, if not as securely as Alagna.  Anges du paradis from Mireille (which Mirella Freni championed and recorded complete for EMI), is third, perhaps a study for Ah leve toi, soleil (Romeo), several years down the road.  The second Gounod rarity on this disc is "Inspirez-moi, race divine," said to be a Caruso favorite, from Reine de Saba.  Its text indicates King Solomon's prize hired builder, Adoniram, to be a very confident, if mildly haughty chap.  Villazon's interpretation seems to portray a hero that constantly has to look behind his back, with all the incipiently yet controllably vibrato ridden throb and backphrasing Villazon engages in here.  The high C at the end, however, is convincing.  Such device as in the above, also accents and colors most phrasing in the tomb scene from Romeo et Juliette.  "Ah! leve toi soleil" opens the first Gounod set, and is sung with the right ardor, conventionally marked by tiny captured scoops, coming off phrases.  Villazon's entrance and two later lines catch for having placed so far back in the throat, and intonation gets momentarily derailed.  "Salut, demeure" from Gounod's Faust quickly becomes expressively leaden and monochrome.Recitative and the beginning of the aria, "Ah! fuyez" from Manon begin well nuanced enough, and for the aria, truly softly as a change from so much else on this disc, but all-purpose bench pressing and volume boosts intrude before long. That leaves two truly atmospheric selections from two Massenet rarities, to close this recital - first, an aria from Roma, Massenet's swan song for the lyric theater and "Ah! parais" from Le Mage, opera with plot line similar to that of Verdi's Aida, following.  The melody, introduced by the cellos at the outset for the latter, somewhat takes after "Pays merveilleux" from Meyerbeer's Africaine, but in more voluptuous color, such as in Thais, and Villazon and Pido both capitalize well on its opulence.  Pido's work, on numerous other numbers on this disc, seems heavy, lumbering, cloying, or just simply out of his idiom, so to speak.Word has it that Villazon, while not having a big voice, is dramatically exciting on stage and probably more immediately engaged with the content of what he is singing.  How this picked up a major award from Gramophone, for the specific problems this disc has, and over two more qualified nominations (Ciofi/Di Donato Handel Duets and a Florez album) is mystifying. So much digression here is over the very specific demands that French opera makes on singers. There's much reason for hope for this tenor, but this disc, for two-thirds of it, does little to help fulfill it
This disk is truly as bad as Nitin's previous disks were wonderful. Take any previous Nitin disk, throw in some Alpha, a bit of Craig Armstrong, some predictable eco-freindly american diatribe, mix until extremely smooth and you have a prophesy. As with most prophesies there no good news about it. My prophesy is that anyone who buys this won't ever buy another Nitin dis
I said I was going to be honest in all reviews, and yes, I kinda clunkered on this one.  I hate this CD.  Simply put.  They can't sing, and the songs are boring.I'm sorry I bought this CD, and other people might not like me saying that, but it's my opinion.  I listen to power metal extensively and there is MUCH better stuff out there like Symphony X, Nightwish or Sonata Artica.Don't buy this, though, you might like it.  I'd definitely listen to it first
Listening to this cd took me back to my growing-up years.  I remembered all their songs I loved back then.  It's a great homecoming
This is nothing compared to their EP, which was great by the way. Songs lack of inventive, arrangements and feeling... maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued, but no more
NOTHING NEW HERE.I like reading the ridiculous reviews of these cds where people gush all over the screens over how much they love Patton.  This cd is dull.  Suffering from Patton overexposure.  Maybe he should actually spend some time and make an awesome album (Like Secret Chiefs 3 - Book of Horizons)  rather than dozens of merely adequate ones
Reba is not country anymore period!!  This CD will prove that.  Just listen to the first track which I think is horrible.  As a matter of fact I think the whole CD is horrible.  Not deserving of Reba's talent. 
Look, as music goes, variations on a theme is part of any genre. This album, however, yells out leave well enough alone. A remix of Sgt.Peppers LHCB might thrill a person born in 1986, but when you hear the real thing, you ask why change it? This album is a total waste of a truly great disc. Like Gipeto said to Pinocchio, stay wood!
There was only one good song on the disk dont waste your mone
sucks. If you like this album you are a poser. That means you think cradle of filth is black metal and slipknot is death metal. One guy I know that listens to norma jean, as i lay dying, and unearth, called me emo for listening to acid bath. How stupid can you be? You posers need to wise up and listen to real metal, such as Morbid Angel, Darkthrone, Amon Amarth, OLD Sepultura, and Dissection
David Bowie always walked a thin line between commercially acceptable and just plain commercial.  This is the first time he fell off and became just plain commercial.  A disco-esque record, it's remembered more fondly than it was received by Bowie fans at the time.  It has some good moments, but overall the production is just too slick and there's a dearth of imagination on it - China Girl is an old Iggy Pop song, Cat People is just a newer version of a previous single and Criminal World is a cover of a song by Metro, meaning there's a grand total of five new songs on it.China Girl proves a perfect foil for Bowie's melodramatic vocals, Cat People is still great even when smothered in too much production and Modern Love proves that you're (nearly) always gonna get at least one classic on a Bowie album.Ironically, while it made him a global megastar, this record also marked the start of Bowie's alarmingly swift fall from grace.  If he'd stuck to the highly original work he'd churned out before this, he'd probably have had his moment in the sun anyway... and nobody could have accused him of selling out.  Now, what's that they say about hindsight
If you want to get into Blind Melon very quick, buy this....If you really like Blind Melon and wnat to hear something new...don't buy this...
I sorta of agree with the person below, This album sucks....plain and simple, however I think he is still doing a great job in Rhapsody.  I gave it one star not so much because it is garbage, but becuase I was looking forward to this album since "Prophets of the Last Eclipse"  Which was great, but trully...I don't know went wrong.  I don't have a problem with female vocalists, but in this album...it is retched.  I don't think I will ever listen to this album ever again.  Sorry!  But its true...do not buy this album, pretend you never knew he had a new album...OH!  and do NOT buy Luca Turilli's Dreamquest either!  Another bomb
Save your money on this one. It's SOOOOOOO bland- with no jams!What a disappointment. Can I get a refund
Tony Kushner's liner notes are a chilling foretaste of his Jew-hatred-soaked script for the film "Munich."  A paragon of self-regard, he sneers at the historicity and compelling morality of the Jewish people's attachment through the millenia to its eternal homeland.  Rather, Kushner makes a point of elevating the moral stature of the Islamofascists who have unhesitatingly and unceasingly for a century prosecuted a campaign of genocidal slaughter against any and all Jews who sought to reclaim their stolen patrimony (through aboveboard land-purchase and settlement, prior to wars of justifiable self-defense).  Like his evil Arab idols, Kushner cannot abide the concept of a restored Jewish commonwealth, secured on a foundation of existential legitimacy, political independence, and territorial sovereignty.  Zionism, and its morally necessary outcome the State of Israel, enabled and is continuing to enable the very effloresence of Jewish culture in the US in the post-1948 and certainly post-1967 vineyards where the Klezmatics have been frolicking and where Kushner has gained his fame and fortune.  But Kushner hates the very thought of being liberated, and seeks to sow that hatred throughout world Jewry.  The Klezmatics should feel ashamed for linking themselves to this cruel purveyor of assisted suicide.  
Just another cd of the awful, awful techno-crud that has infested goth/industrial clubs, while REAL artists like Cinema Strange and Knifeladder get the shaft. Worthless on every level
these covers are pretty bad. some good ones have been done, cameron mcgill @ the uncommon ground tribute, big sir's everybody here wants you is good, but this is bad, no matter what entertainment weekly's review might say. avoid, buy a REAL jeff or tim album
I respect everyone's opinion in here, and I've tried so hard to love this album because I love Pink Floyd and I see how everyone calls it a classic. But I just do not get it. I highly overrated album IMO. Very childlike and underdeveloped, but maybe that is its charm? I see 2 very different Pink Floyds and I have to say I never got into Syd's style. Matilda this, Lucifer that. The Gnome? come on. Astromony Domine was a classic but the rest of the album is a tough listen I'm sorry to say. I'm sure you'll say a true Floyd fan would love this album, well maybe that's true. But for me, when Waters and Gilmour were together, that is the true Floyd IMO. And their reign started with Meddle and ended with the Wall. A brilliant 6 album run (Meddle, OBC, DSOTM, WYWH, Animals, The Wall). For serious collectors, this is a must have and I'll give it 2 stars, but stay away if you expect another 'Wish you were here' purchase, pre-Gilmour can be a tough listen. 
When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style
This is definitely not a bad collection, but there are so many better ones out there, that this should not be your first choice. The song Sweet Emotion has been completely destroyed on this album. the entire bass intro has been cut out, and the song starts about an entire minute into it. There really is no reason to do this, as even on the radio, they play the entire thing, as it runs about 4 and a half minutes long. The song starts at a terrible place too. It sounds like it would if you turned on your radio to the middle of the song, then just stuck it on the cd that way. Again, not a terrible compilation, but definitely not a good first choice
The Cat Carol is the most depressing Christmas song I have ever heard. Not to ruin the ending for you but THE CAT DIES! Didn't exactly put me in the holiday spirit
I think Ms Hewitt misses the mark, yes for an actress turned singer she's ok and its more her acting clout that has landed her this record deal and not her talent as a singer... Would someone off the street with the same looks and musical level get a record deal? I think not... Same goes for the other Latin Jennifer..
I could not wait to get this album.  I usually love to hear the new the Hypnotize Minds albums.  However after so many years groups do make mistakes.  This is a major one.  Chrome could suck his name off of a trailer hitch.  I own the original copies of every Prophet/Hypnotize relese since Mystic Styles, and this is by far the worst to emerge.  They never release a Lord Infamous solo album in 12 years (not to mention he is DJ Paul's brother...wait I just did) and now this???  What's next, a Crunchy Black album lol??  THIS IS A PERSONAL NOTE TO DJ PAUL AND JUICY J...PLEASE SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND RE-HIRE (at least) T-ROCK, GANGSTA BOO, MC MACK, AND BRIBE SOME JUDGES TO GET LORD INFAMOUS OUT OF JAIL!!! P.S.-  This only gets 2 stars for the production value.  
Based on the reviews for this CD I decided to buy it without having sampled it. Big mistake. I love, among others, Marshall Crenshaw, Don Dixon and Peter Holsapple, but what happened here? This was so not fabulous
on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums (i think it is shaker) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert. that should have been as far as it went.  to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery.  if these are blues songs, then i am robert johnson's illegitimate son. "death letter" is good, maybe even great, but cannot compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard.  the rest is a waste of time.  the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd.  these are my first 2 reviews by the way, but all these 5-star reviews for both cd's finally got me motivated.  go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain
This album is so boring in most places.  I don't know where Keith Sweat's head was at.  It doesn't keep your attention on the second half.  Keep it Comin' was okay, but the other songs Keith produced as well as Joe Public were lousy. He was smart to include There You Go from New Jack City, but the songs before and after it are so bland, It seemed like the formula that worked for Keith Sweat's first two albums didn't work here. I fell to sleep while hearing the album's second half--how can anyone create such dull songs on here?  Sweat's trademark whining just does not blend with these songs.  If he had wanted to, he would have given these songs to Usher instead of singing them himself--they'd be better under him(Usher).  But I warn you, don't get this album--it's going to let you down
While The Title cut with Joe Public was Bumping most of this Disc is So-SoFormula Driven.without Teddy Riley The GroovesVibe aren't as Strong
...but this album should never have been released as the "final" Queen-album. A couple of these songs should instead have been added as bonus tracks to one of those many Best of Queen-releases. "A Winters' Tale" for example. Do I know much about the background for "Made in Heaven", well perhaps not. But I know that this is known to be the last studio release. Sadly it has the sound of elevator-music all over, not that the melodies are bad, it just sounds... almost cheap actually -and most importantly to my ears (at least) this doesn't sound like my Queen. One of the most important bands in the history of music saying good-bye with "Made in heaven"? Was this really Freddie Mercurys' wish? It doesn't make much sence after the fantastic "Innuendo" released in short time before his tragic death containing the haunting ballad "These are the days of our lives". The words and the music... wow! And the music video to this song, have you seen it? To me that was the real good-bye with Freddie, and with Queen. And it has the sound of how I will remember them.But is "Made in Heaven" really that bad? Yes, and no. "Heaven for everyone" by Roger Taylor made it sound promising, and don't forget; I was exited when I heard about "a final material"-release. But it turned out, as you might have guessed, far from what I had expected. Old songs from B-sides and solo-albums are mainly fillers for this album... I mean honestly? "Too much love..." then quite a resent hit from Brian Mays' solo-album "Back to the light", I remember thinking "What's the point?" And it actually sounds better from his solo-album without the synth dominating the song here. Don't get me wrong now, Freddies' vocal is as good as you'd expect, it's what they've made out it that surprises me. And what makes me wish they hadn't. At least not for an entire album. "A winters' tale" is a positive surprise though. Perhaps not Freddies' best song, and not better than "These are the days...". But it's a celebration of the beauty in life. At least it sounds like that to me. Freddie captures a moment of harmony and peace. And beauty. And it sounds like a classic Queen-song! "A beautiful day (intro and reprise)" functions well too. But what tracks 12 and 13 are about I have absolutely no idea..? I wish they would have ended the album with Freddies' last "Yeah!" on the song. I wish...So all in all; "Innuendo" remains the explosive good-bye with the "real" Queen. At least it does to me.(Let me add that the cover of "Made in Heaven" is perfect for the title, and somehow amazingly "seals" in its' simplicity the fate of the band with Freddie in the lead. The three band members left (Brian, Roger, John) facing the sunset, and a statue capturing Freddie in a remembarable style on stage. Reminding me of him at Wembley 86. To me this actually expresses something beyond words, and it's impossible not to get a bit of an empty feeling watching it while listening to "Heaven for everyone" or "A winters' tale".)    
Triple H(as Fed Up): I love Britney, she is so pretty and nice and so on. Shawn Michaels(as Hellraiser): Anyone who hates her are just jealous! Triple H: Well, we got some news, Britney is nothing but an ugly redneck piece of trailer trash. Shawn Michaels: This no-talent hack is a washed up skank whose career sank. Triple H: This chick is a skank, unlike my wife Stephanie McMahon who looked good whilst carrying my first child(I just had a daughter). Shawn Michaels: Britard on the other hand is one ugly airbrushed, lying hypocrite. D-Generation X says if you are not down with DX and you choose to be down with Britney and her blind sheep fans, WE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells S*CK IT)
Inspiring? No! Pleasant? No! Entertaining? No! Worthwhile? No!What are you folks sniffing out there anyway? Whatever it is, please consider passing it along, because other than the single authentic and melodic track by Patsy Cline (i.e., Back In Baby's Arms, which is available on a zillion other collections including some of her own), this CD doesn't have an ounce of redeeming musical, lyrical or social value in my view. Nada! Zip!Even the Dylan track is junk! The entire CD is essentially drivel, put to the dull, homicide-provoking sound of endless, droning noise, with an overall signal-to-noise ratio of about one (1.0)!!! What a WASTE of an A-to-D converter
Ok, I've listened to Fat Boy Slim.  That guy's stuff isn't bad, by no means main stream, but worth while.  But ... this Norman Cook - he's horrible.  It's no wonder Cook developed an alter ego.  With the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes, I couldn't believe this stuff had come from the same artist that produced Praise You.  Renegade Master is the type of track I've come to know and respect (that one is a keeper), and I have to give props for I Left My Wallet in El Segundo.  Other than that, this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market.  If this is the sound you're looking for, save a few bucks, check out your local yard sales.  So as not to be too negative, I'll say this; the printing job on the CD itself is charming.  The notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired
Sorry to say I'm not a huge fan of Tanghetto even after seening them play live at La Viruta last month. Few of the tracks are just undanceable and the music gets pretty boring after a while. I say if you want neuvo tango try Narcotango or Otro Aires.
After discovering and loving the sound of Gotan Project I was shopping around for groups with a similar sound.  I stumbled along Emigrante and upon reading the other reviews written on this site about this cd, I thought I had found another gem.  Boy was I wrong.  The first track drew me in and left me spellbound, unfortunately, it was all downhill after that.  I was listening to the cd for the first time in my car and forgot it was even on.  The rest of the songs were so uninspiring, the music soon became nothing more than meaningless background noise
There are only a couple of songs I did like on this cd. I did enjoy Ice Cube and Aaliyah, but the rest of the cd left me cold. I do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them, it would have been better! I suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy.
I am a huge fan of Elvis Costello and ran to the shop as soon as I read the great reviews of this album, what a mistake!!! Very few of the arrangements offer an improvement over the original version. The cardboard cut salsa montuno of 'Clubland' sounds as classy and natural as a plastic flamingo and the wonderful Ska sound of 'Watching the Detectives' is lost in a jazz arrangement that doesn't offer much to the melody.Elvis' voice is not suited the long sustained notes of 'Almost Blue' and most of the songs. It worked well on his 'Juliet Letters' album because the Brodsky Quartet played for his style but with the clean and crisp sound of the Metropole Orkest it is just painful.For me,'Hora Decubitus' is the only song worth listening from this musical jumble
I have followed Bruce Hornsby for over 20 years and own every album he has ever come out with including two concert DVDs.  I was reluctant to buy intersections due to owning all the other, but if you have been to  Hornsby concert you know that he always keeos things fresh..no exception here.  I loved the DVD of some of his performances.  There are treasures here, Imagine, solo on the Piano at an awards show, the Star Spangled Banner at the World Series with Marsalis, and his performance with BB King.it is a must for the hard core hornsby fan
I ordered the DVD of Damn Yankees to watch on TV for my daughter because she is doing a play and needed it for the day I ordered it. I paid for fast delivery because she had a deadline and we were thrilled to receive it on time but was very disappointed to see that it was the CD of only music! I don't think I will order from Amazon again, it was my first time and probably my last. Liz Snyde
I honestly feel that Tesla reached the end here. After "Psychotic Supper" failed to get the label support that it desparately needed the group just fell apart. With this the whole metal scene was falling away anyhow as grunge was dying off after the death of Kurt Cobain, and here was Tesla trying to make up it's mind what way to go. With the opening track "The Gate" it sounded like they were going to head back to the hair days of the 80's, but then the next song "Solution" they played like a lost and wandering band of the 90's. The rest of the songs just followed suit. The groups slogan is "No Machines", but there's also another slogan at foot here, and that's "No Music Direction", and for some bands that's possibly a workable concept as long as there's an inkling of where the bands roots are. With Tesla it's all over the board where they would score a top 10 hit with an acoustic version of the song "Signs", which is a rock song, to where they do a cover here of Joe South's "Games People Play". I feel that Tesla failed to show thier influences here, and was just trying to make a living; which is not a bad thing, but it pretty much kept them at a cult status. I pretty much had this album, but didn't listen to it at the time as I was trying to leave the secular music scene behind, and just move onto Christianity, and I know the album lurked around in my head all this time, so I felt it was time to face it; I feel that the album is below par for a group that can do some memorable songs, and to me it seems they wanted out of the label, and possibly away from each other.
Oh my goodness Rodger, oh my goodness.  Just oh my gosh, I'm just stunned.  This is the crappiest pice of crap that was ever ingested and mushed into chyme.  Yeah, you heard me, this is chyme.  Ok, let's see, let's mix bland country ballads with all kinds of awkward pop/country crossovers.... what do we get, half-baked, half-digested stuff that is for dumb teenage girls who are massively overweight.  Well, they're probably smarter than me........... I'm like as smart as a fungi.  No One Needs To Know and Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under are on the right direction out of the smelly stool sample.  Before I get too many people wanting to massively torture me with horrible utensils I'll say something nice.  Come On Over was an EXCELLENT effort, with all kinds of hooks, great production (errr, I mean it is Robert "I'm actually dead" Lang), and all kinds of fun.  Up! was even better (I'm not going to praise it too much, though, I mean, I AM an 18 year old guy...... so I already feel like I should be staring at a picture of Kevin Sorbo or something... which is not cool, I mean unless it's just hero worship, I could worship Kevin Sorbo)!  But still, we have this horrible, stinking, steaming mass of smelly wet clay-like pudding to shovel into the toilet (it's INTENDED target)...... looks like someone has bad aim
i like a little bit of it, doesent mean its good, i wont throw it away or anything, ill just let it sift...wait...and look at the album cover most of the time. slayer is getting better though
The worst Christmas album I ever heard.  I just bought it, played it once, and will NEVER play it again
The songs are boring, the lyrics are plain. I am so dissapointed. I bought it without listening to it first thinking I would at least find one song. How wrong was I to find out that not even one track speaks to me. Andrea's solo album sucked. Now this! I think their creative days are over and if I see them in concert again, I hope I am not tortured with the music from this new album. Instead I hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band I love so muc
As a lover of gospel bluegrass I anticipated an enjoyable listening session with Blue Highway's latest offering. Let me first say that I am a fan of this group, which I consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom, but what I heard was bluegrass Muzak. Yes, the group's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence, and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller, but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing. Gospel music, even bluegrass Gospel, has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves. A good Gospel recording MUST have some cuts which are humorous, some serious and contemplative, some that push the envelope of orthodoxy, and most importantly it must have an element of FUN in order to keep the attention of the listeners. This disc fails in that regard containing standard old Gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards. My advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new, or buy used. Want mine
I'm a big fan of Great Big Sea and I purchase everything they release. Apparently they were trying to give this CD the "feel" of a live, medium-size venue performance. Unlike their other live DC offerings, this one sounds like it was recorded with a micro-cassette tape in some fan's front pocket. It doesn't give justice to their usual great vocals and unique sound. Overall, I was pretty disappointed and I'd recommend their earlier offerings over this one.
Being a fan of Jack Johnson, I thought this one would be as good as the others.  I wasn't impressed at all.  It sounds like a few guys pickin' around in the basement.  The recording quality has very little production value.  At best, these are okay live versions of usually great songs.  This is an unnecessary piece for your Jack Johnson collection.
The music for the soundtrack was so lame!  I though I was gonna cry cause I figured this was the end of B2K by this point.  The s'track wasn't even all B2K either.  I like the song with Jhene and Omarion "Happy".  Also I liked "Out of the Hood" other then that it was boring. 
Only way you are gonna like this music is if you are some depressed emo kid who listens to punk rock music just because it is punk, and you think that'll make you cool. This CD just doesn't display musical talent, maybe originality, but this is not high quality music
I found the music rather annoying.  It was not what I expected at all
The Raising Arizona part of the CD is almost exclusively electronic and only one 90 second track of the great banjo that I remember from the movie.  I recommend listening to samples before you buy
I'm a "compleat" Beatlemaniac, and I don't mind the political statements at all, but this is a nearly unlistenable record that I have a hard time counting as a serious musical effort or even a real album.  I would have loved it if it had been a 7" single, "Woman is the Nigger of the World," with the rest of it just words written in liner notes.  After that opening track, the remainder is a serious chore to get through.  It's almost unimaginable that this came out between the excellent "Imagine" (1971) and the solid "Mind Games" (1973), but then again, John was not consistent, in part surely due to his apparent and admirable lack of commitment to being a pop star.  Love John for the genius he was, his commitment to peace, and the great music he made -- it's just that there's barely any of it on this particular record. 
Knuff respect to Public Enemy, they are one of the few groups in Hip-Hop history who've provided fans with ill beats and consciouss lyrics.  With that said, this single blows.  It's trash.  The beats are trash, Chuck D and Flavor Flav don't rap, the DVD is just them hanging out in some clubs.  It's a shame, legends such as Public Enemy are far above this remedial single.  If you want to hear their best worx, go and buy Fear of a Black Planet, or It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.  You won't be dissapointed..
With the exception of "My heart will go on" by Celine Dion, Horner's soundtrack is not a masterpiece but a bunch of stinking skunks who are masked by a field of sweet smelling flowers.  For a soundtrack score it is not riveting and really lacks any emotional connection to the film.  Overall it is just really overrated and the hit single got played so much that the masses just fell into a typical zombie trance and went marching to the store to buy it.  This was after they kept returning to the theater to see a fictional tale of love built around a tragic, awful event.  It didn't stop them though; they could not get enough of seeing all those depictions of people freezing to death in the water.  Overall a below average soundtrack that road the coat tails of a hit single that was shoved down our throats for an entire year
We read all the previous reviews and thought this disc would be a keeper. We (my husband, three kids 14, 10, and 5) tried it on a warm, spring evening in the car. One or two songs, like the Banana Splits, Speed Racer, and Scooby-Doo were fun. Most however, were harsh, and too fast for the parents and youngest guy.I would rather try these songs in their original state and skip the covers
This record kind of sucks, but that's okay, because it doesn't suck in the way where you think oh hell we'll never get a good album out of this guy again (like, for instance, Rod Stewart's latest garbage), because, I think, it's not really Lou's fault. The problem is Lou's trying to draw his material from somewhere else, in this case a mediocre poet. We've always been willing to overlook his (Poe's) considerable lack of talent (example:  in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore) because he's so damn charismatic. Morbidly charismatic, but charismatic nonetheless. The danger is that too many people consider his pure dumb fun to be art (which I guess makes him a lot like the Rolling Stones). Lou, who's always shown himself to be a poet but a poet with a wink, has now chosen an artist who is basically Bernie Taupin with a better vocabulary to be his kindred spirit, and from someone who, Velvet genius notwithstanding, produced revolutionary and stunning works like Transformer, Metal Machine Music, and Berlin, this self-effacing friendship is the real tragedy
I have been a NIN fan since Pretty Hate Machine. I think Trent Reznor is a brilliant musician. All of his previous albums have been absolute genius....until this? I pre-ordered this album anticipating another masterpiece. What a disappointment!! I still can't get over how terrible this album is! The only song that is worth mentioning is "You Know What You Are." That's the Trent I know! I purposely skipped the tour just so I didn't have to hear the new stuff! I hope this isn't it for him, but I will be cautious when the next album comes out
While there are some flashes of brilliance in this album, it is compromised by a lack of direction. The 'Tastes so Sweet' mix of Rapture is beautiful, although cut far too short. Faithless, Afrika Bambaataa  Soulsonic, and Crystal Method are all good driving tracks at the tail end of this album. The high point, without contest, is Darude's ripping mix of Rising Star's 'Touch Me'. This is a cut to throw on for the peak... when you find the party is just outside of Barstow with Hunter. That said, then there are all the uninspired tracks in the center of the album. These are more appropriate in an adolescent Brit girl's drawer next to the Spice Girls. For some labels, this would be normal, for Ministry however, it is a dissapointment
This CD has some good songs on it, but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes! It's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than I expected. They are mixed together, and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started! If you don't mind really short songs, buy this, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise
I bought this cd for one song, Walk Away which was one of their best known songs. I was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems. There wasn't. The rest of the album is like an anti-climax. I would suggest a greatest hits instead. If you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away
collective soul had a few nice attempts toward pop music like dosage. The main problem i have with this album is none of the songs are hits so no airwaves and the fact that the album probably has about 7 fillers! Its just to flawed to recommend to everyone it may be if you are a diehard collective soul fans. i wouldnt lose this album but i wouldnt buy it again
I love the sludge and the roar but the vocals are monotone and the lyrics laughable.  Gimme Earth or SunnO))) anyday
I agree with "music fan" about this CD. Eden is a good album, and she's a good artist. But either this album was poorly produced or something, because this does not show her best. I wouldn't classify this as world music at all, because the instruments aren't used and it's more classical pop; if that's a genre. It seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding similar and lacking originality. I love her, she's unique in her genre. But she really shines as a classicist, with Classics, her work by Andrew Lloyd Webber (who she married) and operatic albums. This is what she's best at, so her collaborations on Eden and La Luna, which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically, turned out good. I have a lot of her albums, but I wouldn't buy this one. It's more something to listen to once. A few of the songs are good, the album isn't terrible, but it's not very good
So Far, So Good...So What! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling.  The remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just didn't quite hit the nail on the head.  If you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s, get your hands on that version. 
this is NOT,i repeat NOT five stars!in all honesty it's more like 1.5 or 2 stars and i'm a big fan of slug  atmosphere.albums like overcast,godlovesugly,the felt project,and the dynospectrum album is much better than this.though the lyrics are thought provoking,but slug has been better,the production doesn't hold up.it's some of the weakest i've heard from rhymesayers.there's only a couple tracks that stand out,but i'd have to say "don't ever f**king question that" is the best.if you wanna hear slug at his best check out the dynospectrum album.slug spits classic verse after classic verse
First of all let me clearly state that im from Atlanta and I am a diehard fan of Lil Scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this CD is garbage. Besides Money in the Bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with DJ Don Cannon early last year was on fire, He and Cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point, that was of course before 50's influence which brings us to our problem. The influence of Curtis Jackson A.K.A 50 Cent is very clear on this album. I like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south. If the G-Unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let Scrappy pick and choose his own tracks, verses etc. everything may have been fine. The guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the "A" is pumping this and it is a shame because when Scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable. This CD is garbage plain and simple and 50's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise's up. This is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.I have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he's dropped but, im telling you If you the consumer buy this Cd you will regret it and to Scrappy ditch the G Unit do what's in your heart and get back to business.
I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour.  In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour.  Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again.  I find most of this album to be very average.  Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all.  The majority of the songs are clich ridden in both music and lyrics.  There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably "Safe In New York City" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic.  Probably one of the bands weakest efforts
Do you LOVE "On Eagles Wings"? If the answer is yes, then do you know the words to Panis Angelicus? The answer is probably "no." I don't blame you for liking this CD. The problem is that it isn't Catholic and it isn't Classic. You should ask yourself if you are willing to entertain the songs that Catholics have enjoyed for thousands of years. If you are willing to look beyond the guitars at your local mass, start with Sacred Songs by Bocelli, or Simply Baroque by Yo Yo Ma
thr pros about this album s that there alot of tight rappers and beats the cons about this album is that clue calls himself a dj but he's a dumb phony who doesn't know when to shut his mouth all he does is yell out throughout the whole album saying stupid stuff and giving shoutouts while the rappers rap he nees o shut up an lets us hear the song if u want this album still, go copy it off the net cause the is not worth the money    ohyeah he dosen't even scratc
I have been listening to military band music for years, and am rarely disappointed.  However, this compendium of music by the U.S. Navy, Army, and Marine bands and associated choral groups is not to my taste.  Many of the arrangements are strange, and there is much too much vocal music when what I want to hear is the bands play.  I would not have bought this album hhad I known beforehand what I know now
I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off, I bought it without hearing anything by them before, but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So, why did i personally find this so painfull?Well, the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off, the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons, but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell, being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan, was I recomended this? It's bland, it's week, and the dubby bass, boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually, forget it. The whole package. It is just lame
I like to have natural sounds or some type of 'yoga style' music while I'm either practicing yoga or just trying to relax.  This CD just didn't fit.  There are a few ok 'songs' but the rest of it is either too fast/upbeat or there's too much talking/chanting.  I found myself distracted when I put this CD on
Certainly this album offers very little to a fan of The Ocean Blue's eariler work.  The vocals and guitars sound quite different (gone is that beautiful dreamy sound).  And what about those awesome saxaphone and  keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun?  Just because Steve  Lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether.  So,  anyway, what does this album offer instead?  Harder sounding guitar,  angrier sounding vocals, and songs that are somewhat intersting, but are  lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after  you've had the CD for a couple weeks.  Exceptions: Whenever You're  Around, and Slide are good enough songs to standout  inspite of boring production
I was very disappointed that the version of Paper Roses included on this CD is an updated and new recorded version from 1990.  It is not the original 1973 classic Marie recorded when she was twelve.Interestingly, this new version is produced by Sonny James, the original producer of the original single, that also features many of the original studio musicians.  So all is not lost. Still, I prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this CD included an updated Paper Roses.
Hmm...  Ok, maybe it was not the best reason to want to buy this CD, but I heard one of the songs on it, Hashkiveynu, performed (partially) during an episode of the West Wing, and it sounded AMAZING (it was NOT the same cantor as on this CD).  I am not Jewish and not even very spiritual, but I wanted to have that song in my collection.I immediately searched the web for the info, got the name of the chant and found this CD.  I almost purchased it without listening, when I found a different site, where they actually have rather long excerpts (2 min.) of most tracks, so I listened to them.  Boy, was I relieved and disappointed at once!  Relieved that I didn't buy the CD and disappointed that I couldn't get the song I wanted (I was willing to buy a whole CD for just 1 song, that's how much it impressed me).The song sounds very little like the one from the West Wing, although I do believe that the site where I found the info speficially pointed to this CD as having a recording of the same song used in the show.  And I'm sorry to say it but the voice also doesn't hold a candle to the one used on the show - way too "operatic", as mentioned by many, and harsh and even unpleasant-sounding to me.  It took all the charm and candor right out of the song (in the show, they had a much more natural voice do the song).  I also agree that the choir does not mesh well with the soloist.If anyone knows where and if I can purchase a recording of this song done by a different singer (if it can be the one from the West Wing, I'll be thrilled), please, let me know.  In the meantime, I'm passing on this CD..
I'd like to second some of the other reviewers' reviews of this album. It really lacks the energy and the coherence of the previous album. The tracks in general are a little slower. The production quality is overall about the same, but it is just not as "listenable" as Believe was. The exception I find on the album is the "Club Mix" of "Turn It Around."But if we think about that for a second, aren't we talking about "club music" here afterall? Are we under any pretenses that this is elevator or lobby music? I should think not. What we expect from this band, and from a second album is an equal or better effort at club music. House-ish, trance-ish, and anthemic. It's just missing on Turn it Around.I wholeheartedly recommend Believe, but I'd steer clear of this one unless you find it used.
I can't believe none of the other reviews of the Ultra Lounge series state that these CD's contain almost all instrumental music, with very few songs that feature vocals.  I expect a lounge music CD to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks, and of the four Ultra Lounge CD's I purchased, I count only three songs with vocals on all four of them.  While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them.  The titles of the Ultra Lounge CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks.  The best lounge CD I have heard so far is from an unlikely source.  I purchased it at Pottery Barn, and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs.  Keep this in mind when buying lounge music CD's so that you won't be disappointed the way I was with the Ultra Lounge series
The versions of "Black Sabbath" and "War Pigs" actually comprise half of Black Sabbath's appearance on the April 26, 1970 edition of John Peel's 'Sunday Show.'  "Black Sabbath" features a unique third verse that appears on no other officially released version of the song.  "War Pigs" is actually "Walpurgis," an earlier incarnation of the song featuring entirely different lyrics.  Incidentally, the other two songs from that broadcast, "Fairies Wear Boots" and "Behind the Wall of Sleep," were released as bonus tracks on the supplemental disc issued with the first pressings of the original 1997 release.  All four of these tracks, while fascinating, don't rightfully belong on this collection, as this disc intends to highlight Ozzy Osbourne's career as a solo artist.  For that reason, the live version of "Paranoid" that appears on this set is equally unnecessary.Those songs are frustrating inclusions on an Ozzy Osbourne greatest hits album, particularly since they come at the apparent exclusion of some of Ozzy's biggest hits and/or notable tracks such as "Flying High Again," "Shot in the Dark," "I Don't Know," "Breaking All the Rules," or "Road to Nowhere."To add to the confusion, some of the solo-era material included here isn't exactly what it purports to be.  Ozzy has been the subject of a number of recent legal disputes over writing and performance royalties.  These disputes ostensibly prompted Ozzy to reissue his back catalog in 2002 with, in some cases, re-recorded tracks.  The 'Blizzard of Ozz' and 'Diary of a Madman' albums now feature pointlessly re-recorded rhythm parts, presumably as a snub to the original rhythm section of Lee Kerslacke (drums) and Bob Daisley (bass), who, incidentally, wrote the lyrics to almost every Ozzy solo track from 'Blizzard of Ozz' through 'No More Tears.'  The 'Bark at the Moon' album, while not re-recorded, was most certainly remixed.  It is the re-recorded versions of the 'Blizzard of Ozz' and 'Diary of a Madman' tracks and the remixed version of the 'Bark at the Moon' track that appear on the current edition of this collection.  Finally, the version of "No More Tears" is actually the video edit, not the album version.In addition, due to one of the disputes mentioned above, 'The Ultimate Sin' album was not selected for remastering in 2002 and has subsequently been dropped from Ozzy's catalog.  That album's biggest hit, "Shot in the Dark," which appeared on the original 1997 release of this collection, has now been replaced with "Miracle Man" from 'No Rest for the Wicked.'  Along these lines, the 'Just Say Ozzy' live EP and the double-disc live album, 'Live and Loud,' both of which contain a live version of "Shot in the Dark," have also been deleted from Ozzy's catalog.  Not even 'The Essential Ozzy Osbourne,' a double-disc collection covering Ozzy's entire solo career, features a single song from 'The Ultimate Sin.'  The ultimate sin, indeed.My recommendation is to avoid this collection (and the 2002 remasters) and instead search for the 1995 remasters or, better yet, search for the original albums on vinyl
Lou Reed rocks!!! Dude!! But methinks this collection dost not. The tunes are all good, but there aren't very many of them, and the sound is deplorable, in that inimitable RCA-first-CD-edition sort of way (fans of the Jefferson Airplane and Harry Nilsson know what I'm talking about). A much better jumping off point would be Different Times: Lou Reed in the 70's, or, even better, check out Transformer or Rock 'n' Roll Animal
If you need an experience of pure meaningless noise, this one's for you. However, dont expect it to change your life much.The price listed above for the album is a very good example of the old cliche, "you get what you pay for.
Deep Lyrics man, I'm getting a lot out of this... But just wait for the next record when you'll get Hold On Loosely!
There are some artists who have been active since the 60's and 70's and who are still producing vibrant, excellent music. Paul Simon, say, or Bob Dylan. Kate Bush, though she started a little later. All of these artists have evolved past their original sound but are still great. Joni Mitchell should have stopped when she was ahead. Maybe I don't rate as a JM fan because I've only heard Blue, but I've listened to that album hundreds of  times times over the years.  I wanted to find out what she was up to since then, and bought this album. All I have to say is, it was like nails on a chalkboard. I was EXPECTING her to change and grow, but not into some pale ghost of the 60's droning on about the evils of commercialism and modernism. The lyrics are old and tired, and the instrumentation is hackneyed and stale, too. The only good lyrics on this album were provided by Yates. At least her paintings are good.
I didn't listen the disk but know the recording label. Never heard anything good produced by the company in several occasions when I was hooked by the low price: very poor immitations. Just go for the real things
This is simply a transfer of the LP master done when CDs were just getting started. The quality is inferior to other collections and the selection is weaker. Go for the Collectables twofer instead. Much better sound and more cuts
Let me tell you, Shayne Ward is just one of those pop singers who only go by looks, if he looked like shrek he would not be anywhere today, face it girls your only buying this because you fancy him.Look at Justin Timberlake, where is he today, they go and move on, and thats what Shayne will do except alot faster.This song is so rubbish, the thing I hate so much is that he didn't even write this!So its not his own material, and let me take you in on a little secret he does not care about this song, its not like these lyrics mean anything to him, as he did not write.And on "No Promises" thats even worse than this, yes he might of wrote it I don't know, but does the song have depth, or is it just a plain old expected pop song.By the way it's the second one.Shayne Ward has no protential, neather does anyone who comes of X Factor, its all just one big [...
This disc was simply a waste of my time...very mediocre songs, heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent...Corey's voice is below average....I get the feeling that Corey Clark is IMITATING a good singer with a VIABLE career, and not doing it very well....clearly 'fake it till you make it' isn't working here.  The songs all sound the same, I kept waiting for something to get me grooving, but it just didn't happen.  I think his ego is much larger than his actual musical potential...he either needs voice lessons, a little humility, and some professional grooming (and I don't mean clothing).  
Buddy Holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th Century Masters series.  Every one of the CDs in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous.  This one is no exception.   Look elsewhere
Hate to say it, but this is pretty drab stuff.  That said, I'm hardly about to complain; how could I?  This was obviously written for a film (that I have no interest in seeing), and Mogwai just released 'Mr. Beast', a solid (if unspectacular) album earlier this year.  I kind of see 'Zidane' as a gift, then.  Looking at the whole thing from that perspective, it's impossible to be letdown. But then, retaining much emotion out of this composition is downright difficult.  Mogwai, when channeling the right energies, create sublime, beautiful music -- truly as beautiful as any form of modern music, to my ears.  When they're a bit more ambiguous, though, the results tend to float in limbo and lack direction.  'Zindane' seems to possess certain elements of both these characteristics to an extent, but the result is surprisingly dull -- at best, it's pretty; at worst, it's utterly monotonous.  The ideas are here, too; it's not that 'Zindane' lacks drive or intent.  It is a focused work. Yet,  it's obvious, I think, that the music, contrary to most film scores, desires to refrain from emotional manipulation.  While that's admirable, I find that musically, I'd much rather be manipulated than dazed; this is literally music to listen to whilst on painkillers.  There are a few nice themes and motifs, don't get me wrong, but this is ALL underscore -- Mogwai, in the best way possible, has a great gift at handling melodrama, and here they never appear to be guided by the dramatic light. I won't sway anyone from attempting to get 'Zidane', but I wouldn't hand it out to anyone unexposed to Mogwai in some hopes of garnishing their admiration. No, for that, I would naturally lead them to one of their many fine studio albums.  For, Mogwai is a band, after all -- they are not Jerry Goldsmith or Ennio Morricone.  For those unaware, Mogwai performed much of the score for the recently released film 'The Fountain' -- though they did not write any of the actual material, from what I've gathered -- and as a musical experience, the soundtrack release for that album absolutely blows 'Zidane' out of the water.  In my opinion, it even beats out 'Mr. Beast', so impatient fans who need a fresh dose of Mogwai 'oughta check that one out for sure
I bought this because a few people had put it in their Amazon lists.  I just didn't like it at all.  It is one of those albums where you play it, and you don't take notice of it until the CD stops playing.  It is very old and the music is simplistic.  Cool cover though
One good song, of course "The sound of silence", and the studio version is far better than this one. I am not a fan of the genre as you might expect
While I love Billie, in her own words, these sessions were dull, and uninspired. Since the reviews should focus on one CD, that is the jist of it; boring renditions, and back up musicians that are not the ones that  Billie was used to making for a very uneven collection
This CD while full of nice music, is to me rather pointless.It's listed as a sound track but all it has is background music instrumentals.Does anyone know the titles of the actual songs used in the movie?Aside from Crazy train
This CD had the makings of a great recording. The problem was telling Popper where they were performing!Butch,please record another one but leave Popper at home.He's full of a lot of things,but TALENT isn't one of them
About half the songs are great old songs I'm familiar with, the other half are songs made famous by other artists and most are clangers for Elvis that are painful to listen to
Well, ok, Mehldau's arrangements aren't bad...He does a great version of "Paranoid Android" but otherwise...WHERE'S THE ENERGY?   There's really not a whole lot of excitement or energy in this album, and I do understand this as being a more laid back, mellowed-out album...but it is still possible to be more exciting, energetic, or emotional in this style.   All three of these things are pretty much absent from this CD which ends up making it dull.   :yawn
sinceramente, no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas, incluso renombrados artistas, hacia este musico... ungido de la leyenda GRAPE, amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura, esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados..lastima, piedad, curiosidad...no se , me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson (13th.....).. en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio.. en fin, son opiniones, nada mas.  
These songs are hacked up versons of Rick's music. I played it a couple of times until I got the library of original LPs. The Lps are better. At least they carry full versions of songs. I pass on Rick and this package. RCA cheats people out of good music..
I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!
I am a HUGE ATL Fan. Black Mafia 4 Life, know what I mean. I waited a long time for this release, and it was painful to listen to. It just seemed to lack direction. It might be said that this album (an independent record label) was so bad, that it ended their careers. Too bad, I loved ATL.
Sean "Puffy" Combs, Puffy Daddy, Sean John, P Diddy or Diddy.  When he figures out what he wants to be called is when I figure out if I like him.  Meanwhile, there still isn't one good DVD set for Star Wars.
These guys are not artists. They are unimaginative lamebrains unwittingly and badly rewriting already overplayed music from a long dead scene. It's like a few monkeys build a house, and all the other monkeys rave about it, but in reality the house is just a banana tree with a welcome mat... whatever that means.I am constantly astounded as to how waste like this gets on the radio. Buy this cd if you want to vomit everywhere.
While I doubt I'll EVER get used to the edited (single?) version of 'Nights In White Satin' presented here, I have to agree that the song selection in general is excellent for a compilation of this seminal band.  That said, The Moody Blues (or more likely, their record label) haven't exactly been shy about releasing such anthologies and hits collections on CD, either.  While 'Gold' represents an affordable means of buying some of the best known and loved music from The Moody Blues, it also is for me one of the most trying listening experiences as well.If I had to guess, I'd say much of the music contained on 'Gold' comes from different masters than the songs currently found on other collections, and on the band's original CD albums.  There are definite issues with the sonic quality of these songs as presented on this disc.  For instance, the music track of 'Nights' is horrendously compressed in comparison to earlier CD versions of this song; perhaps the record label was working with an unremastered single release master of the song (my guess), but the audible discrepancies between this version and earlier examples (albeit, in the full album form including The Late Lament and the full orchestral intro) are hard for this listener to stomach.  I can point to any of the earlier music included here and say pretty much the same thing.  Whatever the reason, the original source material used for this CD could've seriously benefitted from earnest remastering work.  While I suspect that would've raised the asking price of 'Gold', I also would contend that great music DESERVES such caring treatment.  As it is, too much of 'Gold' as issued is indeed quite tarnished, which in the real world given the metal that goes by periodic symbol of Au would've been impossible to do.  But evidently in realm of the corporate music world, when selling music on the cheap and banging out sloppily compiled CDs it's very easy to take the most precious and thoroughly muck it up
yet even some of you who agree that the album bites still say that "tub thumping" is okay, even if it "gets old after awhile". that song is CRAP!!! has to be one of the worst songs ever to get play. EVER! sounds like a bad radio commercial for some english beer they're trying to market in the states.that song (if you can call a random string of cheesy choruses a song) makes the strongest argument AGAINST ANARCHY that i've ever heard. proves that people who can't agree on anything can't make a song that makes any sense or follows any consistent theme.gotta go - just threw up in my mouth from the bilious memory of this worthless pop drivel
I don't even own this CD, and after seeing the reviews I don't want it.  90% of the "5 star" reviews are people with ONLY ONE review.  Suspicious?? Look for yourself, it's right there to see.  I have some other meditation CDs that are very repetitive, I'm not going to make the same mistake here, especially with such SHAMELESS self-promotion
My youngest brother, who has a pretty strange sense of humor, bought me this CD for my birthday; I wonder how he knew I didn't own it already? I don't even know where to begin with this one. What can you say about somebody who poses for an album cover in rainbow-painted panties while licking a heart-shaped lolli-pop? And the foldout poster of her reclining on pink satin sheets with said lolli-pop is downright laughable. Does she expect anyone to take her seriously? After her first album, I thought Carey had a remarkable talent that needed some fine-tuning, particularly in regard to her penchant for singing cliches. Instead of getting better, though, she has turned her career into a self-debasing fantasy of baby-doll mannerisms coupled with relentlessly monotonous song choices. Rappers like Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott and Usher are brought in to add spice, but they only drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of gunk that she chooses to sing. She may have a lot of #1 hits, but who can tell any of them apart? Rainbow is only Carey's latest entry in a career that has lowered the quality standard for divas everywhere.		D-  Tom Rya
Perhaps Puffy only got as far as he could riding on Biggie's legacy, but lets face it, he really has very little talent, charisma, charm and just seems so dull, he is basically a male Paris Hilton, going around acting like the world's biggest d1ck ny saying "look people, I got money, arent I cool" besides Biggie(RIP), Bad Boy really is not great, most of the artists are poor quality, The production is awful and no one has not even shown potetial. This album is basically not even worth printing or existing. It is just sad that many great underground rappers are not getting any attention while garbage like Diddy plague are airwaves and puts his dumb face everywhere on TV. I don't know why people like Tupac, Biggie, Dimebag, Chuck Shuldiner and countless other greats are buried but this guy still breaths. So I would say in conclusion that we should do what people like chingy and D4L deserve, a 1 star rating.    
It was awful! The reproduction of the music was grainy, scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to
Did not care for the selections on this CD
Golijov's music incorporates Jewish, Arabic, Christian, Afro-Brazilian, and other ethnic influences ad nauseum...So what?Listening to this disc is like having dental work done without novocaine.Only DIVERSITY NAZIS who want to smugly bask in their own "enlightened" weltanschauung will find much to enjoy here.Golijov cunningly caters to these folks' taste. May he ride it all the way to the bank.
Some will mistake me for a Evidence hater, but I'm really not.  I just want the man to put some effort into what he does.  I'm tired of taking just any ol' thing artists throw at us nowadays because the "fans" don't expect very much -- or simply don't know what good is anymore.  Sure, you can relate to what Evidence is saying, but you can put on a dope instrumental CD, sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head, have a discussion about any topic, and the resulting feeling will be something like the feeling you get from this album.  I quickly get tired of the "slow flow" -- see: talking -- and I feel like anyone can do it.  I don't shell out money for things I can do myself.  Really, the only difference between him and 50 cent is content.  When I hear someone say "slow flow" my mind translates that into "reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to get on" because this album would have been thrown out the window before the jiggy invasion came.  And lot of these beats, though very dope, are as slow as his flow is.  Couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like Joe Scudda (I'm sorry, I tried to like him, but dude is simply terrible), Big Pooh (same goes for him), and Madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener.  The only dope guest shots come from Phonte, Planet Asia, and Slug.  Yeah, I know the fans and jock riders will hate and call names, but I'm going to keep it honest -- fu** real.When Ev actually puts his back into it, he creates some dope material.  "Down With New York City" is nice piece of work that has Ev gettin' busy over an air tight Jake One track.  "Chase The Clouds Away" is another track where Ev does his thing over a pounding ALC production.  The standout to me had to be "Line of Scrimmage" which features Ev and Atmosphere frontman, Slug, getting nice over another dope ALC creation.  With the likes of Alchemist, Sid Roams, Jake One, DJ Khalil, Babu, and Evidence himself providing dope beats, I'd have to say that the production is definitely the strong point of the LP.Simply put, I don't recommend playing this CD while operating heavy machinery.  I respect Ev and his whole crew (hell, I love Rakaa), but this album will make you nod off instead of nod to the beat.  I can only call it the way I see it regardless of whether or not the artist is a favorite of mine or not.  Bring on the unhelpful votes if you want, but I can only recommend this to the die hard fans -- who should eat this one up.  Everyone else should download this and test it out first.Standout Tracks: Letyourselfgo feat. Alchemist  Phonte, A Moment In Time feat. Planet Asia, Line Of Scrimmage feat. Slug (My Favorite), and Down In New York Cit
Holy cow, I was ready to rip my hair out after listening to this. Horrible, sophomoric, insipid... YUK. This is like Chinese water torture. drip drip drip on and on. YAAAGGGHHHH
Roni Griffith has just come out with her new release "Only You"Its Great!!!!!   [...]She has come back so much stronger.  Check it out. Evi
In many ways a relic of its era, "Not of This Earth" is the first widely distributed release by Joe Satriani (a previous EP ended up being reissued as part of "Time Machine", years later).  The guitarist, supported by drummer Jeff Campitelli and percussionist John Cuniberti came into public attention when Steve Vai, a former student of Satriani, ended up singing his teacher's praises in the music press.The result is that this album, more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music, received wider recognition and poised Satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record.The album itself is a bit uneven-- Satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist, but as a songwriter, he wasn't quite ready.  Several pieces ("Not of This Earth", "Hordes of Locusts") seem to run out of steam before they end, and a couple ("The Snake", "Driving At Night") feel like bad '80s metal.  On the other hand, several pieces shine-- delicate and lovely "Rubina", reggaeish and emotionally soaked "Memories", and the overtly Frippesque "New Day" are all fine examples of what Satriani is capable of.  But my favorite is probably "Brother John", where Satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone.In the end, the album is ok, but Satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future.  Come back to this one if you've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more, but most should start with "Surfing With the Alien"
For those who were fortunate enough to aquire one of the first two releases of the THIEF soundtrack (like myself) congratulations - you have the version of the CD that contains the best song on the soundtrack, Beach SCENE. It has been dropped for this US release.For those who were interested in obtaining the Thief soundtrack being mainly interested in the one song, Beach SCENE (most of the other songs can be found on other Tangerine Dream albums), please realise the following differences between Beach THEME and the now dropped, Beach SCENE.The song, Beach THEME is a much shorter track (almost by half) and there is a very cheesy, acoustic, "rock n' roll", drum beat that was mixed/dubbed over the original Beach SCENE song which has the much more mellow and less invasive electronic, sequenced drum beat in it. It's Beach SCENE that was both heard in the movie and over the airwaves back in 1981. If that is the song you remember (fell in love with) and are looking for, do NOT buy this latest release. Keep looking for those Out Of Print CDs - they are out there.On a lighter "note", it's very nice to see they added the ending/end-credits song, CONFRONTATION.This is a lose/win scenario for THIEF soundtrack fans - it all depends on which song is more important to you. If you already have the earlier releases with Beach SCENE on it then buying this latest version  will now complete a defninitve soundtrack for them as that last song in the movie has now finally been added to the official soundtrack
To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the songs with lyrics in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here!  I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie.  Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called Send Me On My Way by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album When I Woke. Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it.  Hope this helps those looking for this song
Brooks  Dunn, Kenny Chesney, Lonestar, Martina McBride, Montgomery Gentry, Aaron Tippin, Lee Greenwood, Neal McCoy, Kenny Rogers, Randy Travis, Phil Vassar, The Warren Brothers, Dusty Drake, Hank Williams Jr., Alabama, The Charlie Daniels Band, David Ball, and Blackhawk. What do these artists have in common? Cutting edge musical geniuses? Gifted songwriters able to speak to a wide range of audiences? Innovators in their genre? Err, no. Actually what they all have in common is that they all appear on this package, created to commercially exploit the war on terrorism, one which contains songs like Where The Stars And Stripes And The Eagle Fly, This Ain't No Rag, It's A Flag, and Back Where I Come From. In other words, maudlin, xenophobic, cliche filled, black/white dichotomous sentiments, and the lack of any attempt at rational or questioning political analysis, all set to fiddles and pedal steel guitars, and to be marketed and sold at Wal-Mart. I should add that I am not against patriotism, when it is intelligent and well informed; this, however, is dumb, reactionary faux-patriotism. Nothing is more so than the song God Bless the USA. As an American who loves his country, I can say that this song, with its syrupy sound and its naive lyrics, does not speak for me.I listened to a bit of this schlock on a plane ride a while back just to see how much of it I could take. The answer was - not very much. What little I could take made me want to drink, and heavily. Some of these performers, specifically Brooks and Dunn, Randy Travis, Charlie Daniels, and perhaps Kenny Chesney and even (I hate to admit) Toby Keith are actually fairly talented; others, like former lounge singer Lee Greenwood, Alabama, Montgomery Gentry, etc, are 3rd rate musical hacks.Ultimately, listening to this nonsense, I'm reminded that some of the greats of the genre, like Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, George Jones, and Willie Nelson were neither knee-jerk reactionaries nor apologists for a ruling political party. Then again, Dusty Drake, Montgomery Gentry, and Blackhawk are no Johnny Cashes. Just Nashville hacks, soon to be forgotten. 
I was looking to get the DVD of DAZED AND CONFUSED but got the CD. When it was advertised on the AMAZON website it led me to believe that it was a DVD as you see it above. (1993 Film) I had to return it and my expense. Very disappointing transaction with AMAZON. Threfore, i am not impressed
If you work in a comic book store, live in your mom's basement, own a lot of black candles, and think that H. P. Lovecraft wrote history books, then you might like this garbage. If you have a life, a clue, or a girlfriend, then you probably will not have any use for this stuff. I still can't figure out how record companies get away with classifying this pseudointellectual fluff as metal. It belongs in a category with Sisters of Mercy or Morrisey. This record is completely lacking any imagination or energy: depressing teenagers is like shooting fish in a barrel. I guess if you want to play dungeons and dragons and fester about feeling like an outcast, this would be the thing to listen to. Personally I think it's a huge ripoff when somebody takes five minutes worth of music and stretches it out into an hour. Don't give these jokers your money.
Informatively, I have Mason's DVD's, which I quite enjoy.However, this CD, labelled, "BRAND NEW," contains many  repeats and situations. In fact, at times I was ahead of Jackie Mason, mouthing word for word the joke and situation he was leading up to me.Mason spoke as if he was rushing to meet a deadline, to the extent that much of the CD sounded like gibberish.  For most of this CD I sat stone faced and suspected that perhaps the applause and clapping of hands were canned.Mason, in my opinion, went overboard in his use of obscenities, loudly and in his asides,seemingly contrived for shock value.As for me, I think that this mislabelled, "BRAND NEW," CD was aflop, and I would not care to have it in my collection for fearof the impression I would leave after my demise.So, another item destined for my shredder.Finally, I would recommend the Mason DVD's, which I would have preferred with a slower delivery and less obscenities that addlittle to his performance.Robert LyonsReno, Nevad
Once again, the geniuses at Universal have failed to give fans a decent collection! Although the single disc Very Best Of released in 2005 provided a fine and simplistic overview of Robert Palmer's career, it omitted a few "must have" songs in favour of live material (making for a 90% OK collection). Earlier anthologies also suffered invariably from "redo" syndrome: the artist redoing a vocal track here, a drum mix there, re-recording entire songs elsewhere. This collection's no different. In fact, there are many "remixed" and "redone" and "alternate vocal" mixes present (something the Very Best Of album avoided altogether, much to its credit). Here, insult is further added to injury with poor song sequencing. Indeed, the classic and sequenced "Sailing Shoes/Hey Julia/Sneaking Sally Through The Alley" trilogy that marked the beginning of Palmer's breakthrough album is present, but the songs have been scattered apart from one another. Thereby pondering the question: What were they thinking? Why was this done in this manner? What do fans really want? A 2 disc set that features the original material (remastered, yes, but not remixed in any way, shape or form) and a proper chronological sequence. Done in this manner, such a set would properly honour one of popdom's most memorable and talented individuals. What Gold has done showed that compilers went through a rock encyclopedia, took the right batch of songs, but mish-mashed them in a half-cobbled manner. This collection does no one any favours. Stick to Very Best Of until another bright light at Universal tries their hand at compiling a decent collection. That said, the way the music biz is these days, don't count on it.
I bought Guerolito after hearing "Heaven Hammer," the remixed version of Guero's "Missing."  That remix, by Air, is the sort of product that makes remixes valid - it takes the passion and yearning lost in the original production of "Missing" and makes it feel at home in a louder, more tempting sonic landscape.  That song became astonishing where the Guero song was simply alright, and the new song, "Clap Hands," is at least a good time.  However, it's hard to swallow the cobbled remixes on the rest of Guerolito - the beat and the original of, say, "Earthquake Weather," (here as "Terromoto Tempo") are both individually appealing enough, but together sound dismayingly like they're from different planets and belong nowhere near each other.  "E-Pro" becomes a groaning mess, the lovely "Farewell Ride" an electronic nightmare, and both those descrptions would be apt to describe the record as a whole
I definitely understand why this band is classified as emo. This CD helped me solidify the impression I had that I don't care for emo. The album is not bad and the band is tight enough for a young band, but the issue I have with emo and with this album in particular, is it's not really anything. It's not hardcore, it's not really melodic....it's sort of stuck in the middle of both but not quite reaching either one. Maybe I'm not the target audience for emo or this band....I get that, that's ok. I can't stop thinking Thursday seem like they're trying desperately to sound like Fugazi and never really getting there. And that's the rub of it I guess....with bands like Thursday and She Wants Revenge...they appear to be reaching for the roots of alternative/hardcore or newwave music but for someone who knows what the real thing sounds like, they're a poor imitation. The sound is immature and lacks the urgency and edge that the original bands had at the time. I have a friend with a 14 year old son who asked me to burn him a copy of this CD. I think I'll just be giving it to him and calling it done
I loved "Come Away With Me" the first moment I heard it.  I also had the opportunity to see Norah and her wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely FANTASTIC! I couldn't have asked for a better!So naturally I waited in eager anticipation for her new album "Feels Like Home" which after only one listen made me feel narcoleptic.  It was a good thing I didn't try and listen to it while driving.  To be perfectly honest, I haven't listened to it since.She is so talented, I wish this effort had been as successful as the first, but not everyone hits a homerun each time at bat.But I still hold out hope that her next album will be better
I was expecting it to have a lot of International type music to it but it virtually sounded the same as the original.  I think I may have mistaken this cd title for another of Shania's.  Her music is great but I don't see a difference with the international version
I remember really liking this album when it was first released, even though I could tell it was not in the same league as The Real Thing or Angel Dust. Listening to the album now, I realise it is by far the worst FNM album since Mike Patton joined. The whole album feels very rushed, it has a sparse, raw sound, very different to Angel Dust's polish. The music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like B-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums. It was a shame to see guitarist Jim Martin depart. He had an unmistakable style and crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of FNM's style and make up. However, being replaced (for a short time anyway) by Trey Spruance is no bad thing - anyone familiar with his work with Mr Bungle will know he is a genius with a guitar and his work here on King For A Day is excellent, it's just a shame that the material he has to work with is largely uninspired.How ironic then that on such a disappointing album, FNM produce one of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius, full of the care and effort, rhythm and melodiousness FNM were famous for. Beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum, it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes 2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is FNM as you'd expect them. Another track that deserves special mention is Cuckoo or Caca, a great metal piece with excellent percussion and keyboards and crazy vocals. It's scorching and funy and another reminder of the greatness FNM once held in abundance.It's just a shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much surprising blandness (Caralho Voador, Take This Bottle, The Last To Know) and 2nd rate metal (Ugly In The Morning, What A day, Get Out). Star A.D. could have been vintage FNM but in the end falls flat, Evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets boring and metal tracks like Ricochet, The Gentle Art Of Making enemies and Digging The Grave are simple and sound like what most student bands are writing. However, the album does end on another note of vintage FNM - Just A Man is funny and catchy with Patton having fun doing his Tom Jones impression and the inclusion of a gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not wanting it to end.Patton's vocals throughout the album are still amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you can't help but feel he was a little bored here - I think his heart always really lay with the far superior Mr Bungle, where he really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the complex and avant garde material.I suppose it's not surprising that King For A Day is a largely empty affair, the departure of Jim Martin and the diminished presence of Roddy Bottum at rehearsals meant that FNM's original chemistry and resources were sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had been able to. It's really an album for Faith No More fans, it's certainly no classic despite some classic material and I feel it was the beginning of the end for FNM, they would improve with their next album, Album Of The Year - but only marginally.
This CD should have been called "The Most Annoyingly Overplayed Songs of the 1990's." With the exception of "Shine," every single track on this CD is juvenile, mindless, fluff that was overplayed on the radio in the radio until you were ready to scream! If you're looking for a CD that represents the greatest music of the 1990's, check out Non Stop 90's Rock or Forever 90's instead. However, you might be interested in this CD if you want to host a cheesy 90's dance party. The songs are kind of fun and catchy if you listen to them in moderation
Mercifully, VH-1 hasn't released the nauseating, moron-targeting 'I Love The 90s' DVD series (yet), so you'll have to settle for a similarly appalling companion soundtrack disc.This is precisely the kind of CD which shouldn't even exist anymore given the availability of this material on the internet, legal or illegal.  There's no rhyme or reason to the collection, and the songs you might actually want to remember...you probably already downloaded them.The source show is easily one of the most appalling projects MTV/VH-1 has produced in some time.  It's basically a bunch of 'comedians' and third-tier celebrities talking about the 80s or 90s (or rather, the highlights of what corporate product was released in 1996, say) with such fond memories and gusto, hoping the next generation ingests this poison with the understanding that Mambo No. 5 was a 'good, memorable song' for instance.Avoid at all costs.  Take pleasure in denying Tag Team their royalties when you find their 'classic' song on online...for free
This CD shocked me. At first I was listening and enjoying the beats on every track. But then listening to the actual content of each song, B*tch this and h*e that. Come on, as a young female, how am I supposed to bump this in my car? Every single song on the CD is disrespectful. You know what really makes me mad, this is what's supposed to be hot, popular. What kind of message is this sending to our young black men? Our young women? I would not recommend this for any one, especially anyone under the age of 16 or any woman.
The remix is totally devoid of any taste:First the vocals are completely-off;the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings. Secondly,there is absolutely no respect on part of the "mixing DJs" for the great vocalists:there  is no melody and absolutely no 'jelling-together' of the music with the vocals. I was deeply disappointed with this cd.If you are into remixes get The Rod Stewart "Do ya think i am sexy" single cd instead
I was very disappointed with this volume. The past 2 volumes had great retro/loungy mixes and this new one is too repetitive and clubby. I was excited to see the Postal Service doing a mix, however it sounded just like any of their other songs. This CD sucks.
My two parakeets seem to enjoy this CD a bit, but if you want a CD for relaxing listening, be prepared to be irritated.  I tried to go to sleep listening to it one night.  I had to turn it off because it just got on my nerves.....I kept thinking it was stuck....like a record stuck in a grrove.  It sometimes seems they recorded it by just hitting the repeat button on a couple of bird sounds.  I think I could have done that.  I'm just glad it didn't cost a lot, but now I can see why.  Sorry for such a bad review, but I just had to tell anyone planning on buying it.  I now just play it for my birds when I am NOT in the room
Anna Netrebko's I Puritani selections are way below the art and skill of Callas, Sills, Sutherland, Caballe, and Gencer. She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding Mozart. Her broadcast from the Met Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note. The same tentativenes is also here on this CD.She should know this. Her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses, not the voice, which is forgiven everything.Too bad; she could be a lovely Tatyana some day.Also too, the Traviata is not that great; Anna Moffo , Renee Fleming, M. Caballe, and of course Maria Callas..Listen to these and hear the difference
Well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work I've decided to write my own review.  I believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip, I just wanna drink beer and cause trouble types, to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks, nothing that hasn't been told a thousand times over. When I first hearsd Sugar Ray back in 97 I thought their sound was revolutionary, I bought Floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album, then the third, fourth, and fifth albums came out, the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that weren't radio friendly such as Glory, Personal Space Invader, and Burning Dog; And with the release of their fourth album I bought it as well, hoping that they would get back on formula; Yes as you might of guessed i was delusional; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted.....Now with the release of their fifth album, they had already lost me as a fan so therefore, I give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of originality
Some of the songs here are good, most notably "Never Be Forgotten".....beautiful.  I heard this song on the radio and I thought it was Faith Hill or Martina McBride singing.  Herein lies the problem.  The song is good, the voice is good.  But if she sounds like Faith or Martina, there's no distinction to set her off from the rest of the pack out there.  Add to this that this is mostly bubble-gum pop and not country....there's really nothing that stands out here.  Why are recording companies giving contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there?  That's the question. 
I can't believe the touch of B.B. King. I enjoy his playing immensely. I know this album gets buried in accolades. But I don't like it. The quality is poor and, differing from other's opinions, the crowd noise takes away from the music. B.B. said, in so many words, that Live at the Regal was far from his choice as his best recording. Typically, he said he wouldn't argue with success--and left it at that. There are so many good albums by B.B. You can't go wrong for $4.65 for the "Ultimate Collection". Sure it doesn't have them all--but it has quite a few of his great songs, including a few from Live at the Regal. I would steer clear of this selection. Or I'll send you mine for free
If the name Pink Floyd wasn't on this cd, who would really rate it higher that one or two stars ?  I am a Pink Floyd fan, but I have to say that I don't like any of their early works.  To me, the band begins to make great stuff with "Meddle" and their first cd were boring, even with the Pink Floyd name on it. The only good track is "Childhood's end", the other tracks are poor
Eight years ago today was the day Blondie's reunion album was released, and though it was great to see Blondie back together, No Exit just fell short on many levels. 2004's The Curse of Blondie(see my review also on Amazon)is a much better album and should have been their comeback. No Exit won't exactly take you back to the hooks that made Blondie famous. Harry's lyrics are wonderful in "Double Take," but the deadpan melody literally kills the song. Fans were also not terribly waiting for jazz standards("Boom Boom in the Zoom Zoom Room") or revamped demo tracks("Out in the Streets"), but the worst cut is the title song that includes a rap verse by Coolio. Both the band and Coolio could have thought of something more productive to sing about. The music isn't catchy either. All is not lost with songs like "Night Wind Sent," and Harry's own transformation in "Forgive and Forget, plus who would dare argue Blondie's potential to shake the pop world again when you hear "Maria." As the album's best track, "Maria" is a wonderful reminder of how Blondie, and Debbie, can still create an infectious pop song that leaves a template on the mind
Mindless jock rock masterminded by a dope fiend. This kind of crap couldn't even sell a can of Coke these days. Choreographed crunches of noise as lame as a crackhead on crutches. I hear Scott weiland kept a billy goat in his trailer during the making of this snoozer -- and that when recording was all done the goat was nowhere to be found, but Scotty was sporting a fresh new goatie
...Sorry, guys, I think that the cover says it all. Totally out of focus and falling apart. I much prefer his later work
you know i thought this would be a great cd but no it is a total piece of dreck exceptfor ken nordine he is a god in spoken word, i wished i would have bought two coppiesone to poop on and one to cover it up.
I saw the movie and liked the songs in it.  I ordered the soundtrack from the movie, but it was not the soundtrack.  They have a dubbed another person in on Ike's part.  All the songs from the movie were not on the soundtrack and some other of Tina's were included.  I feel that if it is going to be advertised as a soundtrack then it should be a true soundtrack.  I was disappointed. 
There is not much I can add to these reviews here. Just like me, a lot of people here were dissapointed because of the fact that so many classic 2Pac songs were remixed only to sound like disasters. Why would such an abomination happen? Suge Knight is trying to milk the Pac legacy until it is bone dry. Well at least he has done something right if you ask me. It sucks that this is how we are forced to remember Tupac Shakur, over tracks chopped up into this. Die hard Pac fans won't even like this, if they haven't heard it already. I'm so waiting for a remix album of "The Chronic" and "Doggystyle".If Suge Knight was smart you would reissue Tha Dogg Pound's "Dogg Food" on dual disc, because that is the only reason why I don't have that album yet.
Yo Nu-Mixx sux i hate when people make cd's like this to make some money off of great artist like Pac. This cd is disrespecting Pac and nobody should get this if your a Pac fan. They take great songs and make crappy beats. Get this if you want to support Pac haters or waste your money
Here's my theory in regards to how one should rate a remix album: If a song is remixed, then that remix should be better than the original song. Otherwise, what's the point?With that being said, Nu-Mixx Klazzics is pretty much pointless. This is nothing more than a cash in album. The people at Death Row/Koch know that folks will continue to buy Pac's music as long as you can manage to put a new spin on it (especially the die hards...they'll buy anything associated with the man). Well, the spin they put on this particular album is just plain terrible.If you have the source material, stick with that. These "remixes" don't make the originals better, they actually make them worse. The beats sound like throw away beats from an old JT Tha Bigga Figga album and some of the lyrics have been altered/changed so that they sound updated (removing Snoop from "2 of Amerikka's Most..." and distorting Pac's vocals when he says his name is just terrible), but these changes are only for the worst. In short, all aspects of this album are sorry. The guests are wack and the beats are generic, hollow, "clubby" beats. Remember y'all, when these albums were dropped back in '96 the beats had more meat to them.There is one decent track though. "Life Goes On" gets a different look and I'm not so sure that it's all that bad. I find it tolerable, but I could see why why someone wouldn't like it. But this is coming from someone that wasn't all that crazy about the original because I wasn't feeling the beat. If you enjoyed the original, then stick with that. Also, I like that the original version of "Hit 'Em Up" was used here. In this version, 'Pac can be heard giving props to east coast emcees that he was cool with (thus proving that he wasn't anti - east coast, just anti - Bad Boy).Whoever gave the green light to have this released should be fired. It's a shame that folks are pimping Tupac's music like this. But they'll continue to do it as long as folks continue to buy it. I'm drawing the line here. Shame on you, Suge. Your label isn't relevant anymore, get over it and move on.Standout Tracks: Don't even waste your time looking for an
I didn't really feel like some of the songs were really love songs.  A lot of these songs I had not even heard before. 
While well produced, I was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings.  Frankie Laine still sounds great - but it just wasn't the same.I bought the CD to replace a well worn vinyl album, but on listening to the CD I found the songs to all be slightly (and in a couple of cases very), different in tempo and vocal inflection - it's definitely not the album I've loved for over 30 years!  High Noon in particular is quite different, much slower, with vocal emphasis changed.  I'll probably listen to the CD from time to time, but not with the same relish that I enjoyed my old LP
If you want the original recordings, don't purchase any volume of Television's Greatest Hits.  I've had better luck recording the songs off of my TV with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my PC.  These collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "The Munsters" that just don't sound right to me.  If the original recordings don't matter to you, then you may like this CD
I wrote a review but I guess it was so bad for Ultramagnetic, Amazon booted it. The album is trash. Nothing at all like the 3 studio albums made over a decade ago. But don't take my word for it, sample for yourself.Ahead of their time? Faith no more. What can I say about this album without my review getting kicked off Amazon again? I've used no profanity or content of explicit nature but this album highly does. 1988's CRITICAL BEATDOWN never, ever gave that kind of deliverance. That's why that's a classic and THE BEST KEPT SECRET is not, by any means (vocally, production, lyrically, concept). Can I get a witness? Please?DJ MOE LUV is the only producer on the album trying to keep that old Ultramagnetic sound alive here on "Vibrato" and "Mechanism Nice (Born Twice)" the album's 1st single. CED-GEE kills the album verbally and lyrically bragging of 16 bars in almsot every track and being very explicit and obscene (never heard that on CRITICAL BEATDOWN by CED). KOOL KEITH does fine on solo track "Late Nite Rumble" but KOOL KEITH is goin' nowhere with his lyricism and on most of the other songs, HIS delivery is sounding just like CED's towards the end of the album. T.R. LOVE? M.I.A. You see him in photos, you hear silence from him, he doesn't even produce a track. Production by CED, MOE and 2 others and the other 2 sound like KUTMASTA KURT producing (producer for most of KOOL KEITH solo stuff). I do not mean that in a good way. The beats of "Nottz" is bangin', the lyrics by both KEITH and CED should raise eyebrows on what's next to come for THE BEST KEPT SECRET being the B-side to the 1st single "Mechanism Nice (Born Twice)".Songs like "Ain't It Good 2 U" (2007) and "Party Started" are for gentleman's clubs for the girls to dance to. Now do you see what direction this album is goin'? If you're lookin' for Ultramagnetic to comback with a reunion album with the same spacey super dope production and/or the masterful, brainiac, monkey wrench lyricism as CRITICAL BEATDOWN; FUNK YOUR HEAD UP and THE FOUR HORSEMEN albums gave you over a decade ago, you will not find it here. Maybe in the next 14 years. Right Ultramag
I had reviewed the first edition of B'Day and I personally called it "Business day" because Beyonc could not offer what we could expect from her especially after the highly acclaimed Dangerously in Love. Actually, in my opinion if Ne-Yo had not inserted irreplaceable" in this project, it could have been a bust. I agree Dj-Vu and Beautiful liar were hits but I give the credit to the casting rather than the script. Had these songs been given to India Arie, God knows what was gonna happen! How can she accept to put out such a poor album? Some said Beyonc views releasing albums in quick succession as a means of ejecting herself from her contractual obligations to Sony Columbia and team up with Jay-Z to form a new record label... but this cannot justify such an inconsistent and poor album.Ne-Yo confessed that the R genre is suffering from serious malaise. "People just forgot what it was supposed to be, what it was supposed to feel like, the essence of what it is," he says forcefully. "It's a vibe, it's a feeling -- it's supposed to make you feel something, as opposed to, `Let me go eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh and put a beat behind it and see if people will dance to it.' Come on man. There's more to it than that..." Ring the alarm from B'Day falls in the same category.I read a reviewer who proclaimed B'Day to be the best he's ever had and this is like saying George Bush is the best president America has ever had... Does this person know The Beatles, Stevie Wonder or Aretha Franklin? I suggest him to go back to the stores and get one of their albums and he will then be able to differentiate between music and marketing. I suggest the same reviewer to get albums called what's going on' (Marvin Gaye), Purple Rain (Prince), The Day (Babyface), or even the recent Let's get lifted (John Legend). It is very sad to see artists (especially hip-hop) concentrating on making hits, shooting sexy videos with the major target being going platinum and most of the time I find it better to buy the single and not the entire album since they all are full of fillers. What follows is that after a few months we completely trash their records. Africa is the world's second-largest and second most-populous continent with 900 million people. Maybe if the same guys had a purchasing power which exceeds Latino market, Beyonc would be realising another edition in Swahili which is the most widely spoken language in Africa and she would be arguing she's had a great love for African culture ever since she was a child pretending she's coming back to the roots. Anyway, let's not be fooled by these music industry games, their aim is to make money and this entails ignoring the basic artistic aspects. I agree bootylicious Beyonce is the hottest lady in the music scene at the moment and none has denied her natural talent as a singer but she needs to refine her albums and give us s.th that can reach our soul. There are some female artists who are making good music without injecting too much cash in marketing to force sales: Corrine Bailey Rae and Heather Headley
I like the music, but the sound quality is terrible.  I bought this CD because it was released in 2003, but there is ZERO improvement in sound quality from previous older tracks
The lady can sing, but her "Christian" message is compromised because of her part in "Chasing Papi", where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage.  It's "Crystal Clear" to me that Jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part.  It's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee, much in the same way that Stacie Orrico is now becoming.....and is it just me, or is it coincidence that these two womens' album covers look strikingly similar?  It appears their paths in life are similar, too: compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart.  As with a recent review of Orrico that I made, I'll give Jaci Velasquez her due:  she can sing, and what I mean by that is sing the roof off of a house!  This album was excellent.....was.  Now, whenever I think or hear of Jaci Velasquez, I can only think one word:  HYPOCRITE
what a shame.  c.a. was such a talented and beautiful young woman but apparently got some horrible career advice.  maybe she wanted to be this way, but most likely, it was a manager, or record company trying to create a even more slutty successor to britney spears.  more is not always better, and in this case, it is definitely worse.  hopefully, she banked her $$, cuz i can't imagine that she'll ever recover from this debacle.  that would be as likely as a porn star trying to make it in hollywood.  very sad
I picked this up because a) it's Boz Scaggs, a guy whose records I wore out when they first hit, and b) it's full of great old songs.  BUT:  Boz sounds like he's doing something else, maybe surfing the internet or looking out the window, when he sings.  Hard to imagine that the man who punched out "Lido" can sound so half-asleep performing great material.  A washed-out, almost depressing performance.  There are many much better renditions of these classic songs.  I imagine it's hard to come up with new material, but please, if you're going to do these songs at least sing as if you're awake.  No emotion, no involvement.  And to add annoyance to injury, Boz somehow found the world's worst drummer for this session.  If you can tap your fork on a tabletop you can play the cymbals and traps as well as him, incessantly dopey and grindingly repetitive.  Pass on this one
Except for the song, Mother Mother, I didn't really care for the rest of the cd.  I bought it for Mother, Mother so I guess I got what I wanted.  I had hoped to like other songs as well, but, oh well
It's a decent album but she seems to copy riffs a bit on this album. Mother Mother definitly rips of Stairway To Heaven from Stairway's ending vocals riff. (and as we wind on down the road..) Does she give Zep credit on that? Now that Rockstar Supernova has used the song twice it has brought Mother, Mother back to life a bit but that riff rip just annoys me. Good female yell and complain song but I just can't get past that riff rip
I bought this CD not long after it came out.  It didn't last long in my collection because it only has a few good songs on it!!!  I like Somehow Our Love Survives and Abandoned Garden.  Other than that this is a mediocre effort for Michael. He has used this kind of Brazilian theme on Sleeping Gypsy already. Stick with your roots Michael...you are from California...not South America. Try buying Blue Pacific instead!!! I abandoned this one a long time ago
I can't, for the life of me, understand the appeal, or better, the necessity for the Black Crowes. To call all the riffs recycled is to give them credit for originality they don't possess...There's nothing here that hasn't been done better, with more creativity and feeling, and of course, originality, by the Stones, Faces, et al...And it's not a valid counter-argument that the Stones stole  from the great blues masters, because, of course, they did...but what they also did is add some value, something of their own, that was completely fresh...What these guys have done is the aural equivalent of sewing a new name tag on..
I was deeply disappointed by the so-called return of the funk with the Headhunters reuniting with their original lineup. As compared to Herbie Hancock's original Headhunters release, the Return of  the Headhunters is missing one main ingredient, the grease. This recent  release has traded the grits and gravy created by the sounds of  overdriven analog equipment and early model synthesizers, for over-produced  smooth jazz-funk, complete with overused N'Dea Davenport RB hooks that  left this album flat
This CD was supposed to expose a new side of Dar Willams, it has failed to do this. The lyrics, and songs are repetitive of previous works. I would suggest buying something else
Bobby Bare is a great singer, one of the most underrated country singers ever.   However, most of the songs on this cd pale in comparison to his earlier work like Detroit City and Millers Cave
I found the vocal delivery on this CD too distracting to allow me to relax. The frequent hesitations and awkward phrases prevent any sense of flow. The narrator's soft, lilting voice is not by itself hard on the ears, but too often it sounds like she is improvising and reaching for words.
usually jerry's scores for movies are priceless,(i.e. the other score for legend)but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much tooforced for my taste.it's ok as a weird sort of comedy album,I suppose,but from the  main theme I was laughing because it's meant to be such a serious experience-but isn't!I think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd.(.
this cd is pretty awful,you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd, one of the worst songs ever is Calling,, it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground, na na na na , na na na na, i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer........
Fight Club is without a doubt the greatest film I've ever seen. Yeah, I'm a fanboy. And what? And to make a great film flow, you need great music, right? Well, you need great music that fits the film, and the Dust Brother's score more than does the trick. The film is dark yet satirical, and it needed a score that would compliment that. However, the score simply doesn't stand up on its own. At times in the film it perfectly enhances the dark atmosphere, but its only a part of a tense scene. And hence, it sounds rather empty by itself.No matter how much you like the film or thought the music sounded good in it (as I did), I wouldn't recommend it. Like so many other scores, it could have been made into great music but fails since its just lifted from the film

All in all, I was really dissapointed; I really enjoyed the King Geedorah album.  I thought the King Geedorah album boasted  stellar, thematic, production, tolerable skits, and street-wise but deep lyrical content.Doom is on the boards for about 1/3 of the tracks on 'Escape...'  All have the stereotypical Doom sound, with the only standout being '1,2...1,2.'  The X-ray produced tracks are minimal, but generally sound stiff, lacking much of a groove - thin synth lines, few sampled melodies.  I did like 'Warning (Kong),' which has a nice, minimal, dark groove.  The lyrical flows have a classic New York sound, pretty good.  Lyrical content is pretty bad, unless you enjoy repetitious rhymes about smoking weed and women riding my d$*. 
...AND IM HAPPY ABOUT IT!i think i might cry if'n it shows up again. fareals.if albums where 3 dimensional this wouldn e'en make the c-side!i love me some roy, but bruh hurt me with this one.i forgive him tho, cause he done gave me much much pleasure up til now... ...um, hope that came out right. *pimp struts off stage/pounds chest with gorilla fist/machismo free flowing*m'out yall, peace!
I did not get my order. you were suppoused to send my money back. i am waiting.thank
I purchased this CD shortly after finding out that Nickel Creek would be disolving their union as a band.  I hoped that this collection would be suitable for both myself (as a strong supporter of Nickel Creek) and my two children.  This CD honestly fails to deliver a suitable substitution for the music that Nickel Creek produced over the past 7 years.  Although, I guess that was an unrealistic expectation to have for this CD.  You have to keep in mind that the members of Nickel Creek were just children themselves when they released this CD.  I don't believe that they had found their true musical identity, and they obviously wouldn't have reached their full musical potential yet.  This CD isn't really the best for a todler either, so I have to say that this purchase was a let down overall
I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds. No, it is not fun, hip, relaxing, good to dance to, or stimulating. It is a selection of hackneyed Sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices. I have this rule for music: if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta, it sucks. Consider yourself warned. If you like good music, try French Cafe instead
This is probably the worst CD I have ever bought. It had won some award and just bought it without listening to it, hopping that it would be OK. I listened to it and threw the CD in the trashbin. Waist of money or just not  my kind of music
I had the privilege of attending recitals of many of the 50's and 60's Jazz Legends - before they became household names.  It was truly an honor and a blessing to be part of an era that will never come around again.  I heard brief notes from this CD and I must agree that Mr. Winston did attempt to capture Mr. Guaraldi's timeless expressions, but the this production did not have the same "golden flow" as the original. 
Looking at the liner photos makes clear that Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync (and doesn't he know it, especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy Bunny Flight Attendant).  Which raises the question: is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an ARTIST?  Not to put too fine an edge on it, let's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent.  Falkner does everything on the CD and my reaction is so what?  His voice is mediocre; his lyrics are banal (Life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness) or precious (Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound); the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound, with a disspiriting sameness song after song.  Give him two stars simply because he CAN do all the stuff on the record, but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to, say, Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs.  We'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs
Look, I dig stand up, and I dig fat jokes, but this guy isn't that great.I got a friend who loves John Pinette, but I can't see it.He tells jokes about how fat he is, how he likes to eat, how he doesn't like to move.  Its the same over and over and over again.  Its dull and it's too easy.  They're not even jokes, really, just comments on how fat he is.Also a fair part of his act consists of "asian people talk with accents and thats funny" which I find cheap.  Stereotypes shouldn't be jokes, and even when they are, they shouldn't be THE joke.  John says something with broken english and the audience laughs really hard.  Why?  Why is that funny, here in the 20th century?Maybe I just don't "get" his humor, but I don't think this guy is any good.  I perfer comedians who tell jokes.On the plus side, this guy is clean, which is rare these days.  But there are better clean comedians around.   Try getting a Brian Regan album or an Emo Philips album.  Jerry Seinfelds album is good too.  Try those guys because they're clean and legitimately funny
I have all her other cds I especially love Unsung Heroes there is a vibe to that cd that gets u right in but with this one its like shes just tryin far toooo hard to be good....Sure the technique is spot on but THERE IS NO SOUL the emotion is missing...for me I like my jazz vocals with feeling. I like the singer to take u on a journey deep into to the song. u wont get that here all u will get is technique..
I have both Volume I  II so couldn't resist buying Volume III.  The music was good, can't complain about good pickin' like that but I did notice that the original intent of the album is being re-thought it appears and it takes away from the entire concept for me.Will The Circle Be Unbroken II was originally made to showcase the talents of the decendents and family of the original players/singers on Vol I.  It was keeping the "circle" alive by bringing in fresh new sounds from new generations of musicians of those who played on volume I.TOM PETTY??  Where does that come in to play?  How does he fit in the circle?  I was amazed that "this ones son" and "that ones son" were invited to play on this album, but the Huskey's (whom I loved for their bass playing) were totally ignored this go 'round.Junior Huskey played Vol. I, Roy Huskey Jr. (Junior's son) played Vol. II.  Why wasn't Roy's son John invited to play on Vol III?  Isn't that the purpose of this album? To keep the circle alive?  Roy Huskey Jr has 2 sons, one of which is a musician (not sure about the other one).  Where was he?  Given the tradition of the albums, I don't see how Tom Petty could possibly be invited over a 3rd generation family musician.  I was very disappointed to find the Huskey's not on this album.  They were the backbone of the first two.Not just the Huskey's, but there are other noticeable's left out of this album as well.  It's just a shame that such a great concept has gone down the tubes.It seems to me, that in favor of the elite, the circle has most definitely been broken which really takes away from what the album was intended for
The fact that this has had no US release was an immediate warning .... however as a longtime fan I figured I would check it out.  Boy is this bad.  There are a few decent tracks, however the truly awful "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", "This Magic Moment", "Only You" - among many others - make this unlistenable.  Miss Ross is a great singer and interpeter - check out the delicacy she approached the Billie Holliday material.  She is a producer's singer: Ashford and Simpson, CHIC, Holland Dozier Holland - even Hall  Oates - all were able to take her talent and create - in some cases - true all time classics.  This is a mess.  Diana, your voice still sounds great - STOP executive producing your projects
the track selection is fine and okay, but the track order is bad. No FLOW! proving that he just took popular tracks that other big djs are spinning and sold an album without a smile. the mixing is terrible and abrupt, its basically not mixing. no art there. 
Like the Backstreet Boys (essentially the same band), and Brittany Spears (their female solo artist - and I use the term loosely- equivalent), NSYNC represented all that went wrong with the music world in the '90's. Sure, there have been completely commercial bands out there for ages, but at least groups like The Eagles wrote their own material and played their own instruments. Not NSYNC, who instead rely on unimaginably boring backing tracks and a stable of professional songwriters who couldn't write a decent tune to save their lives - I bet even their voices were digitally altered. And then there were the inescapable hits - Bye Bye Bye, Pop, It's Gonna Be Me, Tearin' Up My Heart, et al., that weren't even good the FIRST time around, to say nothing of the nine trillionth. No risks taken. No attempts to step out of their winning formula that somehow made this group of no-talents famous. Basically, this band was thrown together by a bunch of record company chumps who saw five or six guys who wanted to be famous (and probably had never previously met), sent them through the assembly line, removed any sense of individuallity or creativity they might've had, and dumped them upon the masses, who they must've brainwashed or something. I didn't even like this group when I was 10, to say nothing of now. Makes you wish Zappa was still alive - he'd have a field day with a group like this, and undoubtedly dish out some of the funniest insults ever in the process.
Best of Dark Horse is another half-hearted attempt to gather George Harrison's greatest songs together. This time we only get tracks from 1976 to 1989. While there are some good songs (Blow Away, Crackerbox Palace, Cheer Down, etc.) the rest don't represent his best songs from this period. Where's Faster, This Is Love, Someplace Else, etc?The only reasons to purchase this CD are for the rarities Poor Little Girl, Cockamamie Business and Cheer Down.Until they make a true Best Of, we'll have to make our own single-disc compilation. Here are the tracks needed: Apple Scruffs, My Sweet Lord, All Things Must Pass, What Is Life, Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth), Living In The Material World, Crackerbox Palace, Blow Away, All Those Years Ago, Dream Away, Cloud 9, This Is Love, Someplace Else, Got My Mind Set On You, End Of The Line, Handle With Care, Cheer Down, Devil's Been Busy, Any Road, Rising Sun.[DW]
Chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again. FFTMC and BTS were lush and beautiful productions. NIcks latest attempts have been pathetic...from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint...even his older 'pop' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he's doing these days...no, we're not saying recycle the older productions, but instead it's a matter of putting the effort and 'originality' in the profuctions...a signature if you will...and hey, it doesn't have to pigeon hole you if done with class...yes, how the mighty have fallen...oh brother..
No one questions Lyrics Born's talent, which can be matched by few. His breakneck delivery will make you swear they sped him up in the studio, except then if you go see him do it live (recommended: he is a charismatic performer) you realize they didn't.The problem with this release is not, therefore, Lyrics Born himself. It's just that there's not enough interesting things happening around him. There are handful of standout songs on this record, but there is no excuse for it running as many tracks as it does. The skits remind me why I sometimes think the whole idea of skits on CDs tired itself out in about 1997, if not earlier. Worse, the fillers sound similar to the hits but less memorable, making the whole album kind of drag, and the grooves, guitar licks and keys, all of which are good in small doses, become sort of flat after a time, especially when Joyo Velarde isn't singing backup vox. Surely a few of the songs could have become B-sides on the single, or something, instead of bloating the album itself.Do That There, Rise and Shine, and One Session are my favorite tracks, the ones I would say go buy from the iTunes store or something right now. There's nothing wrong with the rest, I just don't find myself listening to them much. I like the concept of Later That Day but it should probably take less time out of the day to listen to
While filled with talented performers, this cd sucks. Rocky is a campy, 1970's B-Movie, that's what makes it enjoyable. Even as a stage show it's a hokey, rock-and-roll extravaganza. This cd tries to turn Rocky into Thoroughly Modern Millie, and it just doesn't work. The corny sci-fi sound and less than amazing vocals are just what make Rocky..Rocky. This cast has so much less enthusiasm and energy than the original Roxy cast.And lastly, Tim Curry is Frank. His rendition is too ingrained in my head for me to accept the twangy annoyance that is the Frank on this album. Ripley is a little too legit for Janet, and the female Eddie weirds me out. Buy the Roxy cast. It's so superior it's almost laughable.
This product is listed as "Limited Edition Special Packaging" at a cost of $30.99.  It's nothing but an ordinary CD in a plastic jewel case with a "Made In Hong Kong" sticker on the back.  It's the import version.  There's nothing "special" about the packaging.  Save your money and get the domestic version for $14.The album itself is awesome by the way.  Nick Cave continues to make fantastic albums.  Even though I feel ripped-off by Amazon's inaccurate advertising I must say this album is totally worth having.  This is raw and noisy.  It's removed from the introspective albums that Nick Cave has produced with the Bad Seeds recently but is better conceived than any Birthday Party record ever was.  It's not The Bad Seeds. It's not The Birthday Party.  It's GRINDERMAN!To be fair, I asked Amazon to refund the price difference between this misleading product and the domestic version, the difference being about $17..  They agreed and I got my refund in no time.  Thanks Amazon, great customer service
It is ludicrous to even mention the fact that The Duprees have lasted so  long and can still be seen in Atlantic City considering the fact that there  is not one original member of the Duprees in the group that is seen in  Atlantic City. This is a major problem with many groups purporting to be  from the 50's and 60's. The Duprees appearing today is a perfect example of  caveat emptor ... buyer beware for those readers who don't read Latin! For  those of us who were Duprees fans, this is a not to be missed CD of the  original Duprees with the incomparable sound of Joey Vann and harmony that  is hard to match. They did Joni James proud in their remake of a number of  her hits. It is nostalgia personified hearing the original Duprees
Diana Krall's popularity is not hard to understand, she's easy on the eyes and possesses a fine voice - rich, round, and polished.  But that's where the good news ends.  The selection of material and the narcoleptic Bossa-Nova-on-the-rocks arrangements combine to create a CD that is nothing less than a love song to Darvon, in fact, inside industry sources maintain that the entire CD was recorded in the frozen food section of a supermarket late at night in order to eliminate the middle man.The rule with standards is, don't do them unless you can bring something fresh to the fair.  Ms. Krall beats these exhausted warhorses mercilessly; cruel and unusual punishment considering it's a wonder they're still standing.  The resuscitation of Popsicle Toes is both the final insult and injury, for blissful years this sliver of saccharine twaddle resided in richly deserved obscurity; how could she do this to us?  Wherever there are hotel lobbies occupied by mildly inebriated people who aren't listening to each other, much less the ambient audio wallpaper, there will be a demand for music of this type.  The Diana Kralls of the world can always find work because for many - smooth equals good.  Walk, don't Krall.  Beyond this woozy, soft-focused world there is music that is real, and really matters.    
Agreed, the fan IS there, but I must admit they are actually singing well in the actual Solesmes style (based on these samples).  I have heard superb chant and frighteningly bad chant.  This is not as bad as it gets I assure you.  Try to find something from a Seminary or Monastery
I would love to own this soundtrack but why anyone would pay 120 bucks is just plain dumb.  Quite frankly I would like to see your copyright on this item to see if you are just Reburning these CD's and reselling them.  For 120 bucks you should be reported to the authorite
I was prepared to spend the original $26.05 list price for this motion picture soundtrack. At that price it was already the most expensive out of 12 CDs ordered. I was refunded the money to "The Last Starfighter" due to an error listing. When I went to re-order, the new price is $49.95. What a joke! Someone is pocketing an incredibly high profit margin. I would love to have focussed my comments on the actual composition, but until it is sold at a fair price, I will reserve my rating
Ok, at long last Public Enemy has finally let me down by allowing a bunch of sub-par average, non-innovative, non-avent guard, DJ's mix there stuff up. Even DJ Spookie's mix was not that grand. Everything sounds like beats that I discovered in the early 90's.On the other hand, this album is only a couple bucks used, so I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest buying it if only for 54321 BOOM which is perhaps one of the best PE tracks ever to come out! Not only are the beats right on, but the lyrics are some of the hardest I've heard yet! And for the note, my review has nothing to do with me not being flexable to change of sound. Infact I LOVE the new PE (Whirl Odor) even though it has club friendly sounds, mainly for the fact that they are not your mere average club beats (they are very multi-layered) and of course the lyrics once again only get harder and harder and harder, and more direct and to the point as we aproach the last times of this world(lyness)
When merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from Switchblade Syphony, one can only be disappointed in Diva Destruction's music.  The positive aspect is the better production on this CD compared to their debut
This cd should not have been released because it adds really nothing to this Jarrett quartet's other three releases.  It's like taking a fat paint brush full of cheap house paint and making a greasy mess of what WAS a very beautiful triptych.  "Belonging," "My Song," and "Nude Ants" are all virtuoso, spiritually empowered performances and should by all means be purchased and enjoyed.  But, I'd go nada on this one if I were you.I was sitting with my 88-year-old mother listening to the last track and complaining about how lame it was and she said it was "hum-drum."  And she's 88, likes Lawrence Welk and it was past her bedtime.  (It's past "Late Night Willie's" bedtime too, I hate to tell you.) Heck, I've heard high school jazz bands cook twice as hot as this "Keith and the Somnambulists" incarnation.  Garbarek sounds like he's going to give himself a hernia trying to get out the altissimos.  I can't think of one interesting drum riff in the whole 61 minutes plus.  (Neither can Christensen.)  Les Scandinavianes sound like they need about 10 hours sleep and then, maybe, they start thinking about picking up musical instruments.  Jarrett is as wired as ever, but even he can't keep up with some of the tempos and the overall mood is disoriented, forced and cumbersome.  How any reviewer can say that this release captures the quartet's tight integration, displayed amazingly well elsewhere, is beyond me.      With the exception of "Innocence," none of the compositions are very good, either.  "Oasis" has an interesting, if dire, melody line, but it can't summon the required ambience because of all of the clutter and dog poop around it.  Unlike the other three releases mentioned above, this one has very little magnetism - the first track is all rambling rose jazz, where none of the musicians are feeding off each other.  I don't enjoy this kind of jazz, so cliched and unintegrated.  It contains that Jarrettian need to rush things and gang jump the tempo with heavy-handed neurosis peddled as jazz fusion. You feel like some nut in a BMW is suddenly sitting 10 inches off your bumper, too demented to use the passing lane. (Yes, I know Keith has mastered his scales and likes to crack knuckles with tempos and, yes, I now have a headache.)  There is an interesting part at the end, however, where Garbarek cuts way back on the throttle and swaggers around in the lower and upper registers of his tenor sax in some nice ways.  But the transition is contrived at best and bears no organic relation to the first part.  Only "Innocence" benefits from the fact that these guys are probably taking a red eye flight to New York soon.  It is a beautiful lullabye, arguably Jarrett's best composition.  True, the "Nude Ants" version is all you need really, but something happens on this version of the song that is very special.  Jarrett puts in one of his best, if not his best, jazz piano performances.  The composition is perfectly suited to his virtuosity and sensitivities and the somnambulists, who are still pulling a Code 9, can't screw it up even if they want to.  (There is a halo around Keith Jarrett's head I bet you.)  Garbarek (somnambulist #1) plays the melody with a lot of heart, but he screws up the tempo in a very brief, weak improvisation.  The man is tapped, knows it and decides it's time to end the song.  Palle Danielsson (somnambulist #2) misses a lot of notes (doubly bad on double bass) and goes off into an ill-conceived, top-heavy improvisation right at the beginning of the song. Like Garbarek, he knows enough to STOP and retreat, letting Jarrett take over.  I can't remember a dang thing about somnambulist #3 (Christensen).  But Jarrett's effort cannot be touched and he plays like a true wizard.  A week later at the Village Vangard ("Nude Ants"), they'll all be playing at this level.  If anything, I'd like to see the PM version of "Innocence" included in a compilation of the best concert performances by this quartet rather than a whole release of this mediocre concert.  For the most part here, we get hum-drum mountains, where many of the great riffs from the releases mentioned above are handled like a shaky old butler serving up tea, with people getting burned and tablecloths getting ruined.    In particular, Garbarek's performance on "Nude Ants" is far superior to this one and maybe the mean streets of Greenwich Village got his "Norwegian up."  Maybe they weren't so sure if they were going to make it back to the hotel alive - New York USED to be like this you know - and, well, it just might be your last gig.  On "Personal Mountains,"  it's all polite "thank yous" and Japanese clapping robotically.  Not a tinkling glass of booze in the whole schmooze.  Not even a bonze meditating for more.  But, that Manfred Eicher, such a card, I tell you.     
Like the other reviewer of this cd, I am also a fan of Buffalo Tom. Unfortunately this doesn't sound very similar to BT, in fact it is a bit dull.  None of the songs seem to have hooks or melodies that stick - after you hear it you instantly forget it. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be fair, since I only played it 3 times, hoping it would grow on me.  I'd recommend "Up Here" instead of this one, it's much more listener friendly
VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED. E-40 RAPS TOO QUICK, HE IS TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND HE SOUNDS LIKE A TRICK
man i don't know what he was thinking when he recorded some of these songs.  the musicianship is, of course, outstanding and his voice is perfect for covering lightning hopkins, furry lewis, son house (shaker lp) but who wants to hear repeated renditions of my old dog blue? i agree with other reviewers who laud "james alley blues" "richland woman" the 2 l.hopkins songs "katie mae" and "darling, do you remember me" muddy waters' "little geneva" and sonny boy williamson's " don't start me to talking." the other songs do not merit a second listening for anything other than historical interest.  the "shaker" cd is even worse.  son house's "death letter" is above average, maybe even great.  the rest is barely listenable.  if you love the blues, particularly folk blues you will be infinitely happier with any l. hopkins cd
Stinkish-I totally agree with you 100%!!!! What was mattel thinking when they released this item? Some songs are ok, but "Hit me baby one more time?" That song is soooo old! And so yesterday, by lip singer, Hilary Duff, is sooooo yesterday!!!! You gotta be desperate for music to actually buy this or want it.If you think that i am way wrong then include me in your review
Although a few of the tracks seem inspired, it's mainly Mulligan going through the motions with Getz, with very little chemistry between them.  Anything Goes and Scrapple From the Apple are nice  enough but beyond that it's weak.  Mulligan himself didn't speak very  highly of the recording session, saying that he enjoyed his other dates  with Desmond, Webster, and Hodges, but mentioning that Granz wanted  that session a lot more than I did.  Of course, it would be quite out  of the ordinary to hear anything but negative remarks about Stan Getz and  his sparkling personality.   Save your money and go buy the 2-disk reissue  of Meets Ben Webster.  Or, if you don't have it already, the  seminal Pacific recordings with Chet Baker
I purchased "Empty" not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable, but eventually forgettable, pop/rock.  This sophomore effort is, simply put, amatuer and sub-par.  Some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as "Empty" B-sides, while the cover of "Electric Avenue" never really distracts most listeners from thinking "What is this and why?"  Over all, this might appeal to most Christian radio listeners, but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is: mold-fitting white noise
Having been a fan of Joan Osborne's take of "Son of a Preacher Man" on her original indie record and "Heat Wave" from the recent 'Standing in the Shadows of Motown' soundtrack, I was looking forward to hearing this record of covers.  I was ultimately disappointed.First of all, I have to say, there are two real gems on here that really needed to be updated, one for its amazing vocal/instrumental sound (The Spinners' "I'll Be There") and the other for its message (Timmy Thomas' "Why Can't We Live Together").To be sure, there are some great tunes on here that I am always up for listening to, such as Stevie Wonder's "Love's In Need of Love Today" and Undisputed Truth's "Smiling Faces Somtimes", but Osborne adds little to these.  When she does change things around, the effect is questionable.  I know that Norah Jones has brought back the torch song style, but Osborne's bluesy take on Edwin Starr's "War" is seriously misguided.  The same is true when you rip the melody and add bland vocals to classics like Aretha Franklin's "Think" or The Band's "The Weight" - especially since the former could have really used some punch from such a powerful singer like Osborne.Overall, this was a missed opportunity.  I hope her upcoming 2005 record is a reinvention
I should have reviewed this along with FM. Both were double record hit soundtracks. Both represented youth. Both are excellent time capsules of what radio was playing. One was a bad movie with a great soundtrack and the other was a classic movie with a terrible soundtrack. This is the terrible soundtrack. When the best songs are by Billy Squier and Sammy Hagar you know you're in trouble. Jackson Browne, Joe Walsh, Don Henley are each awful. So were the GO-GO's. Not surprisingly Don Felder and Jimmy Buffet both sucked. I almost fell asleep in route 128 traffic when Graham Nash played. The band that called themselves Poco can't be the same Poco I grew up with. There were some listenable tracks by Timothy B. Schmit, Louise Goffin and Stevie Nicks but then there's Quarterflash. However, amongst all this crap was a gem...the very last song is Goodbye Goodbye by Oingo Boingo. This song rocks and Danny Elfman sounds crazed. Unavailable anywhere else which saves this from the trash
Ryuichi Sakamoto's credibility is on the precipice with Chasm, a turgid unlistenable work of crud. Check out Coro and Only Love Can Conquer Hate, both sound like factory machinery at work. Dire, dreadful and diabolical. Stop being the artiste Ryuichi and have a go at entertaining. Your fans deserve better
La Grange is probably at the top of most ZZ Top fans lists, and rightly so as it is superb, but the version contained on this collection is the one where they did some weird digital reverb stuff to the drum track, which completely destroyed the roadhouse vibe of the original recording.  It is so awful that I don't know how anybody can listen to it.  Thankfully they got smart and went back to the original for Rancho Texicano.  Clueless classic rock stations are still playing the version contained here, dummies.Also, Waitin' on the Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago are two absolutely essential tracks that are inexplicably missing here
This album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky, wacky, vivid personality of the first three Galactic studio albums--this is boring, flat and generic. Is that Stanton Moore or a drum machine? Precede straight to Garage a Trois
I own all of Bebo Norman's CDs, and I LOVE all of them, except for this one.  I bought it and listened to it once, and I hated it.  It does not sound like Bebo.  This sounds like Steven Curtis Chapman or Michael W. Smith or any of the other mass produced Christian/pop music artists.  On all of his previous albums, even though he changed his sound slightly, it was still generally very acoustic and Bebo-ish.  This album sounds nothing like his previous music.  I was disappointed. 
I expected more african vocals in it.. thats the main reason i brought the cd, i recently became a fan of that kind of music.. it had like 3 songs on there that i liked, besides that this album is garbag
 On the track,"Cleo's Mood",it sounds like something that BookerT.And The MG's,along with the Mar-Key Horns would've cut.It sounds Like Steve Cropper on the guitar,and Booker T.Jones on the keyboards.The sax style is definately Jr.It's a soothing piece
This young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice, albeit a little underpowered, but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture. There is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties. In fact, I suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short-shorts. Once again, sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art
 This is humor? When does the humor begin? Is it close to the end cause I reckon that this ain't funny. Maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone, I reckin
I really don't want to be mean, but I find this album very shallow.  Classical Indian music is a very complex, subtle and beautiful thing.  Comibining it in this way may help to get these wonderful tabla players to a wider audience, but the true energy has been tainted and lowered to make it palatable to simple-minded people who need westernized electronic and wishy-washy "world music" cliches.  I don't find this music to be uplifting or enlightening or interesting.  And this is not coming from a strict old fundamentalist of anything, I have delved deep into the avante guard, minimalism, "new music", eastern and western music theory, microtonal, etc. I would recomend jsut being a non-westernized album and getting the full benefit of tabla playing.  However if your mainstay is jungle/drum, then this would be a step up for you, so go for it, it is worth the pruchase in that case
This was the worst thing I've ever heard, except maybe Clap Your Hands Say Yeah.  My cousin who has absolutely no musical taste introduced me to them and I hate them forever
this album had two good songs at the most. ralph was good with new edition. it's apparently obvious that he can't stand alone. bobby should have been the lead for new edition. then we may never have seen this terrible album. ralph isn't that good of a singer. this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group doesn't mean you are the best. ralph is miles behind bobby
This Air Supply should've been cut off a very long time ago.  Whenever any of their songs comes on the radio I immediately shut it off.  Bad ear candy is all they ever recorded.  Mindless, sappy garbage.  Even Bread's music  was more interesting than this
The 1 star is for this 5 star CD box set being no longer available. Does anyone know why or if it will be reissued soon? I have the Highlights CD and the "Live at the Plugged Nickel" double LP - but not being able to buy this is disappointing and puzzling.Thank you in advance for any help.Scott K Fis
Jimi Hendrix was an ideal guitarist to lead a power trio, and he thrived in that format.  He inspired other groups to attempt it, with varying degrees of success.  But the Experience was a unit, able to soar on stage in extended live versions of Hendrix's compositions. Had it not been for the demon of discontent within the trio itself (that curses so many otherwise excellent bands), the Experience might have created several more inspired albums than it did before falling apart.    The album BAND OF GYPSYS was jarring upon its release to those of us looking for Hendrix to continue to maximize the potential of the Experience.  At the time, loosely associated groups that traded off lengthy lead parts in a more or less generic old-style blues format were common and certainly not original -- much less cutting edge.  It's true that Jimi does some respectable work on this record against the backdrop of the blues grooves supplied for him, but there's an odd and unwelcome shift in the balance.  Buddy Miles became a kind of intrusion into the world Jimi had fashioned in his previous work.  On a Hendrix album, songs sung by Buddy Miles didn't move the bar; they did not elucidate Jimi's universe.  Buddy's drum work was simply not in the style of Mitch Mitchell, and that was a large step down from the Experience's innovative grooves in songs like "Fire," for example.  Listen to "Fire," and then listen to any cut on "Band of Gypsys."  Listen to Hendrix's wild half-sung, half-wailed vocals on the previous albums, and then listen to Buddy Miles sing "Changes."  You can't reconcile the two styles, and that would not be quite so bad if it weren't for the obvious fact that Band of Gypsys, under Buddy Miles' unfortunate influence, were not a step backward toward traditional blues rather than another reach into the future already painted by Jimi's previous work in tracks like "Are You Experienced?" and "Third Stone from the Sun."  Jimi's guitar work put him several steps ahead of the blues in terms of making his instrument perform overdriven rock tone poems and distorted rock concertos on his behalf.  Band of Gypsys turned Jimi backward into a lead player in a blues band, which one might even have mistaken as being headed up by sideman Buddy Miles. That's not what people bought a Hendrix album for.  It just didn't work very well as a release from what people still considered the Hendrix Experience.  Jimi seemed to have gone off track somehow, and the effect was to make him seem a little less what he had been up to that point.  No doubt people got smoked up and enjoyed portions of the album that seemed like an intimate studio groove, but the cohesion of the Experience, the clear creative identity of the Hendrix Experience was not there.  You can say it was as simple as the fact that we missed Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell, and that may be true.  But whatever the line-up, people were not entirely ready for Jimi to share his stage with any other would-be featured players. 
It's not great music to dance to
First show on Broadway I ever left at intermission. I bought the tickets because I didn't think I could go wrong seeing a show directed by Strohman, starring Craig Bierko who was fantastic in Music Man and was flat flat flat in this show, and music by Harry Connick Jr. whom I have loved forever. It taught me that everything has it's place and Harry's place is not a Broadway stage. I hope for his sake, he does not try again. If I could rate something at zero stars, this would get that rating
I'm a hardcore Lynch fan and find this album a big dissapointment. I like his older season of da sicc style nott this new stuff. In one song they're talking about louie vitton, thats not the lynch i kno
I am completly shocked at how high the scores for this album are on amazon.  Trust me, I am not someone who claims to be a music expert, but I am a big fan of Jam/Funk and Jazz fusion.  I play bass, I understand music, and Umphrey's is among my favorite bands (others include 311, Widespread Panic, Deep Banana Blackout, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soulive, Medeski Martin Wood).  In general I am open to all kinds of funky music, and Umphrey's usually puts out.  In my opinion, this band had the talent and unique sound to become the next generation of funk (following the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 311).  With this album I was expecting them to develop their sound from Anchor Drops into an album that could achieve mainstream success like RHCP's Blood Sex Sugar Magic did, while staying true to their unique roots in Jazz, blues, rock and even some metal.  Like I said, they fuse genres like no one else can...THIS album, however, was a complete failure in the areas I have described above.First off, I can understand how reviewers point to the production quality, and the musical talent displayed throughout the album.  Umphreys Mcgee is insanely talented, and no effort could hide that from the listener.  HOWEVER, to be blunt this album is boring as hell, has no funk or rock in it period, and is frankly somewhat depressing.  IF your expecting wild guitar improv, explosive beats and fun, uplifting music--ignore this album.  If you are a fan of Umphrey's live show and their past albums--ignore this album.  If you tend to be willing to overlook production quality in search of funkier, jazzier guitar rifs and bass experimentation--do not buy this album.  The only way I can summate this album is that its a typical indy type album.  Slow songs without enough music, little variance from song to song, depressing lyrics, and a slow pace.  Some say this is Umphreys showing their full range, I say this is them bottling up their range in a more mainstream package that is not all that enjoyable.The only reason I wrote this review is that Im amazed by the other reviews on this page.  I wish I had never heard this album, it is a pathetic effort from a band as experimental and fun as Umphreys Mcgee.  They missed a golden opportunity to come out with the next great funk compilation, this album is a step in the wrong direction. I strong advise the listener who likes to be entertained by music, rather than production quality and introspective lyrics, to steer way clear of this album.  This was a massive dissappointment beyond any album release I have ever heard (including By the Way from RHCP, which is an achievement in musical creativity compared to Safety in Numbers)
I may not be an expert on steel drums, but I do listen to Jimmy Buffett a lot! He has a great steel drum drummer. After listening to this cd, I gave it away in a white elephant gift exchange this past Xmas
This cd its just horrible, they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! There are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out
It seems that even the best bands have only a finite number of great melodies in them, and the Flower Kings exhausted theirs in their first four cds.  Here we have yet another double-helping of their ageless wisdom, strewn across two cds to our fiduciary detriment.  Though not as crass and offensive as Stolt's "Wall Street Voodoo" or Bodin's "I AM", this is nevertheless lyrically naive to the level of silliness.  There are a few good instrumental passages mixed in this release, but not enough to justify its purchase.Stolt said in a recent interview something to the effect that "...peace  love never go out of fashion..."  Well, neither does informed maturity, and you won't find any of that in this group's recent output.  Just more utopian preaching and good vs. evil typecasting.Their liner notes advocate sending money to Greenpeace and Amnesty International, but I would counter that any American would be better investing their extra cash at St. Jude's Children's Hospital.  I'm going to sell my copy of "Paradox Hotel", and probably several more Flower Kings cds, to do just that.There are some sick children out there who need our support and encouragement far more than these would-be hippies
I have been a Ronstadt fan since the early 70's, and although the Nelson Riddle stage and the Mexican stage were not my style, I still loved her vocal perfection.  This is truly the only album I haven't played more than twice (I didn't like it the first time, which surprised me, so I tried it again). It doesn't showcase her voice or her talents. The songs are very ho hum.  Linda, put out a Christmas album (been waiting for years), and try to get sweetness back for this old fan
Jonny's conversion is fine and I hope he is happy, but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums.  If you want christan rock maybe this could be for you, but he missed the mark with me big time
She doesn't sing... SHE YELLS!!! And using one of Ednita's songs as she did with "Lo que son las cosas" is just sacrilege at its "best" (or worst). It's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself. She has absolutely nothing on Beyonce or Cristina Aguilera. Her cd is just plain bad! If you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices (and that actually SING), you might want to look for La Lupe, Celia Cruz, Ednita Nazario and Lucecita Benitez... and these are only the ones I remembered at the moment
The Firm(a conglomerate consisting of Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown and the relative unknown Nature(who took the place of original member Cormega after a heated dispute))...came up with the "brilliant idea" to collaborate on a full album...after the release of "Affirmative Action" from Nas' It Was Written album.  After enlisting the assistance of Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records and production by the infamous Trackmasters,  The Firm's album is subpar to say the least...it sounds like each individual artists is trying too hard to outshine the other and many of the beats consisting on this album are just a lil too sample heavy...."Hardcore" for example.  However, I will admit, there are some shining moments by all four members....and some half decent production....i.e. "Phone Tap"..."F**k Somebody Else"(lyrics are forgettable since Foxy is doing what she does best on the mic...talking about sex and its many forms....I think you might be able to masterbate to this one...LOL).  I will give this a decent try but I can't go no further than that.  I will agree with one reviewer saying that listening to the group as solo artists is a more satisfying
If this isn't worst Dead album then In the Dark is
You know the music industry is in decline when people are giving this single a perfect rating.  Run for cover
   There is not enough space for me to explain why this film(and soundtrack) are woefully inadequate of the name Dr. Seuss.    The Fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism(what the book was complaining about, wake up people!) and James Horner's score which has a couple of nice moments but doesn't have that Seussian sound. 'Where are you Christmas' is annoying beyond all reason and I mean both versions. And whose bright idea was it to have Jim Carrey mangle 'You're a Mean One'?   If you're looking for a more Grinch like score, go find Elfman's Nightmare Before Christmas
I've owned this cd, but didn't keep it for very long because it's too poppy and slick for my tastes. I guess when about 1981 came around Billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his 70's style, and on this offering, he kind of wanted a 50's or 60's kind of sound. This stuff is just to slick for this hombre. He never made a solid album, after the release of GLASS HOUSES, in about 1980. This is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about, but if you've got some integrity, you'll probably want to steer clear of this one, and buy anything he recorded in the 70's
I bought this album on the strength of positive reviews and personal charts displayed on amazon.com and amazon.co.uk. These suggested that Eloy's Silent Cries and Mighty Echoes album was redolent of Pink Floyd and Yes. Actually it is, but only both bands at their very worst. The album opens with an inept attempt at Gilmouresque doodlings circa 1973, moves on to some truly rank singing, with the singer's phrasing hardly assisted by a strong German accent and thus the suspicion that he doesn't understand the absurdity of the lyrics. Actually, at times the lyrics do remind one of Jon Anderson at his silliest, although we forgave Mr Anderson and Yes because they were superb musicians and songwriters. With Silent Cries  Mighty Echoes the tunes are pooor and for progressive rock, the song structures are of almost childlike simplicity. That this album was made in the late seventies is extraordinary in itself. It would have been appalling in 1972. To discover it was recorded in December 1978 is gob-smacking. Unforgiveable tosh
I heard from a number of people that Amon Amarth were an excellent death metal band, so with that in mind, I though I'd try OSFTGH. What I hear, and it certainly seems I'm missing out on something, is sloppy musicianship and poor songwriting. Just because you have mead dripping from your beard, and you scream out lyrics that contain, no mercy, vengeance and "it's your time to die" does not mean you can create "authentic" Viking/metal. These idiots could definitely take lessons from: Enslaved, Manegarm, Falkenbach to name a few. Don't fall for the hype!
This CD just doesn't have the quality it should. Some of the songs have had the lyrics cut out or removed such as Danny Boy. I have the Cassette and it was great but this just doesn't do justice to Ray Price or his  songs
I knew this wouldn't be the Sia from Zero 7's album. Little did I know exactly how bad she could be without the superior talents Zero 7 have behind the mixing boards. The song production is terrible. I couldn't find one song I really liked on this CD. Sia truly has a unique voice but it's evident that good production can make a star out of a flashlight. Still, I'm severely disappointed, particularly because I had to pay for this CD as an import
i deeply love the music of joni mitchell. it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you, to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it (as i stupidly did). the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it (a new mature joni! a return to the roots! a brilliant acoustic album! and nonsense like these...) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see (well, hear) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years (except "dog eat dog" which is superb, but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it's an '80s disaster). it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening. ok, some lyrics are quite good, but nothing compares to the joni of the '60s and '70s. so, i really do not get the point: it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say (how painful it is to face reality!), so, why should all of you praise her? just because of what she did in the past? ok, let us say that she WAS the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation (according to me, much better than bob dylan) and let us praise her forever because of that; but i truly cannot accept that we still flatter her in everything she does, even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art. i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album (and anything else from 1982 up to now - except, as i said, "dog eat dog"). if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell, try anything you want from the 60s and 70s. really, anything. try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins. you have to be prepared, for it could be beautifully dangerous: once you know her, you will never let her go away from your soul
At no point in my following review am I by any means intentionally downing Hank Jr. I am just trying to give an honest review of this cd.At the time this album was realeased, Hank Jr. was riding high, winning big at the CMA's and ACM's.  He was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career.  But then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll.To me this cd is a studio recorded version of a Hank Williams Jr. live concert.  The only difference is he didn't botch the vocals as he does on his live show.  The music is decidedly 80% not country, it drifts towards eighties rock.  If you trace Hank Jr.'s recording career, you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of.  I must say though, this cd contains one of Hanks last top 10 hits, "If the South Woulda Won," which is an hard to find recording on his compilations.  I'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise, just because of that song.
Ignore the big word "Karaoke" on the cover and the microphone shown, this is just a music CD, it does not display anything in a karaoke player
This Album Is not what I call a album First 4 trackz are the tightest with the tightest beats.  Best track on here is I practice Looking Hard probably one of the best trackz he eva made in his whole career I love that song but otha than that Captain save a hoe and Mail Man are a discrace. He shouldnt have even made this cd until he got more track
I got hooked on Tiesto about 5 years ago. Heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album. Neverhteless, it wasn't but it was still tiesto though right? Well...the hits on this CD are about 5 years old. The build ups are terrible and I felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists. Stick with "Tiesto:Nyana" ...10130340345435 times better
Wen i bouht dis cd i thought is waz my holmes on it but it was jus sum dude wid a big azz hoodie and hat.  when i put dis in my playa it was broken the rappers, main peter, voice sounded liek a blender.  dah turntables sound like my moms bong a bubblin damn nigga was my favorite track but that wasn't on dis cd.  I wish i had da real copy and not da malufunked up one.  peace out dawg KEEP IT REAL AND STAY WON WID DAH UNDERDAWGZZ
I bought Kayslays Pain From the Game about a week before it came out in most stores(my local cd store likes to sell their copies ahead of schedule;).  I read that it featured production by Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, Eminem and the Heatmakerz.  And as far as rappers go, most of the Shady/Aftermath camp is on here somewhere along with a ton of other big artists (fat joe, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Scarface, Memphis Bleek and Prodigy, etc).  So I expected this cd to be a big step up from the Streetsweeper Volume 1 mixtape (which I would give 3 stars at best).  But for all the talent on this cd there's not many good songs.  I thought the production was pretty weak.  Some no name guy produced most of the cd but even the kanye west, swizz beatz and eminem tracks are pretty bland.  If you have to have every song your favorite rapper or producer ever made, grab this disc.  If your looking for good music leave this one alone
Denis Leary's whole act is stolen from Bill Hicks nearly word for word. Save your money and search Amazon for Bill Hicks
This Entire CD  HBO special is stolen material. All this material was originally written  performed by Bill Hicks. Buy Hicks DVD "Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian" if you want the material in its true formhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0004Z33FK/qid=1130712550/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-5459925-2315938?v=glance=dvdBill Hicks was also paid tribute on TooL's Aenima album
As owner of Every single Chill/Lounge music CD I am aware of, this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time.  Ultra Chill series 1-4 was outstanding.  While Ultra Chill 05 is not a complete disaster, I could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating.  Quite a few 4 star songs and lots of 2-3 star songs.  Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs.  There is a lot of Jazz and Latin chill on these two discs, which I also like, but the Jazz/world/latin chill tracks here were repeats or nothing great.I think the person that rated this 5 stars doesn't own a lot of lounge/chill and is probably a lot easier to please.  I'm very dissapointed.  Maybe this 'genre' is all dried up! :) Oh well...I'm off to listen to "Chillout Seesions 8"... Hopefully it will be a lot better.  I highly reccomend Chillout seesions by Ministry of Sound.  Chillout sessions 1-7 are outstanding... Time to go listen to the new 8!
Amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of Brahms' music. With a few exceptions the moto of this CD can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius'. The choice of music is also quite perfunctory. There are many Brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose. Buy at your own risk. My only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of Brahms from this CD..
There is at times, a fine line between noise and music. NIN not only crossed that line in this cd, but stomped on it a few times in the process. Not even close to the calibre of WITH TEETH, this cd is a waste of time and an insult to the talent that resides within this group of musicians. Songs that go from semi-music to irritating noise and last four times as long as one can abide, while "playing" the same thing over and over and ...well, you get my drift. If great music is your thing, pass this one up. Or write me a note and tell me why on earth such a great group would release such an abomination
Despite all reviews posted here in this page are given 5-stars to this release, I need to be honest and explain why I am giving just one poor star. No, I am not crazy. Let me explain my point-of-view, and after that you can decide if this JH album really deserves more stars. Just to start, this album does not have a spinal-column that could guide the band(?) or the musicians thru a solid path. There are tracks played by a duo, trio, 4tt, and sometimes a very loose quintet, and each of these tracks have a different mood, without any presence of a jazz soul, or even a real smell of jazz. Maybe the intention of recording these tunes was to make a homage/tribute to Mr Strayhorn, or maybe a recognition for Mr Henderson value in the 20th century Jazz History as one of the most important hard-boppers ever. But the result was very poor. If you really love Joe Henderson (as I appreciate), try any of his albums from the 60's (as a band-leader or as a sideman), mainly those from the Blue Note era. In time: I gave one star, in memory of his brilliant carreer. This particular album deserve zero-star.
Almost 10 years later... and I am still waiting for the punchline.  I think this is the most properly named album of all time... as the easiest summation is:  it lacks ANY punch and keeps you waiting for something that never comes!  Its terrible, especially when contrasted with Pornograffitti.  Gone are the great guitar tone, riffing, rhythm, power, and groove that marked most of the prior three albums.  It's what the forth side to "III Sides To Every Story" could have been... "Yours, Mine, The Truth, and THE SUCK".  The songs are lackluster, but its really the guitar sound that kills this album album.  "No Respect", surprisingly, by name, is the only song worth any respect and the only song near upbeat on the album.  "Waiting for the Punchline" still remains in my top 5 worst albums of all time... I dont write negative reviews unless a CD is really bad in general or really bad compared to the bands other work.  In this case, it fits both... its bad for Extreme... and stands up as exceptionally bad among all other bands' albums as well.  Conversely, in my opinion, III Sides and Pornograffitti are 4 and 5 star albums, respectively
As others have noted, this was a time of turmoil for the group. Now trimmed back to a fourpiece (they had just lost guitarist/singer Bob Weston and singer Dave Walker), they also changed producers after 5 straight albums they had either self-produced or collaborated with Martin Birch on. This CD also leans really heavily on material from Bob Welch (this would be his last release with the band) and it suffers deeply for that.Most of the few highlights here are furnished by Christine McVie. The title cut is a nice lament about male prevarication. The understated "Prove Your Love" is also a winner. Of the Welch contributions, the only real standouts are the mystical "Bermuda Triangle" and gentle closer "Safe Harbour".There are plenty of miscues, filler, and outright bad material here. McVie's "Come a Little Bit Closer" is produced like it WANTS to be a hit, but it's much too slight to stick in the memory. Welch's "She's Changing Me" sounds like Chicago colliding with the Mac...the horns don't work here. The handclap bridge in "Silver Heels" seems too poppy and out of place in the context of the rest of the tune, which is execrable anyway. The silver lining to this disc is that what might have been a death knell turned into the band's finest hour just one album later..
An absolutely lackluster effort from some very talented musicians.I gotta say, I could have used a little more cowbell
After breaking the collective hearts of the soft rock-loving populace by leaving the powerhouse group Chicago, Traitor Cetera made a half-baked attempt to reconcile himself with his fanbase by recording this stinker.  It's coincidental that the first track is titled "Big Mistake", as if Traitor knew his leaving one of the premier groups of our time was the worst decision he would ever make.  I bought this album way back in 1986 with some birthday money, and after I had listened to the album once, I made myself go and apologize to all of my family members for wasting their money so foolishly. What else is here?  Oh, you have the "Karate Kid II" ballad "Glory of Love", a tune so nauseating it's made me completely ignore the second film in the canon, and go straight from the original "Karate Kid" to "III" and "Next" whenever I do my yearly film marathon.  I just pretend the second film never existed.  It also has the semi-smash "Next Time I Fall", where Traitor makes it a point to hog the spotlight completely from guest vocalist Amy Grant. In short, if you a) thought Cetera's leaving Chicago was a great decision, or b) like your music pointless and nauseating, by all means get this album.  If you want music with real heart and soul, just go buy some Chicago.  You'll be glad you did
I cant understand how anyone can give this album more than one star.  Luckily I got this cd for free when they were handing them out to everyone who came to their shows on their 2005 tour.  I love classic Journey, but this band has gone downhill faster than I ever thought possible.  Most of the songs are terrible-boring music and even worse lyrics.  'Arrival' was pretty mediocre, but this is about 5 steps DOWN from there.  Granted, Steve Augeri does complete justice to the old songs in concert and really sounds great, but he obviously has nothing to offer in the way of songwriting.  The only way this band will ever create quality new music is if Perry were to stop sitting around at home and come back to the band.  Otherwise, the band should seriously consider not making any more new music and just go on tour every couple of years
A lame group of angry teenagers screaming about themselves. Ironic lyrics like "Image of the Invisible" do not make them intellectual. This trash is not music. Get it off my radio! If only I could give 0 stars..
Method: Take a monster, genre defining album you recorded over 15 years ago, borrow the voicings, polyrhythms and sound effects, rearrange them to slightly (but not *that*) different tunes, crib the album art (cheesy then; cheesier now) and re-release.The point? Well, to The Man, it's obvious. There's one born every minute. But for genuine, discerning afficionados of electronica? Search me. Like a good souffle, it was better the first time.Indeed, inventing Oxygene Parts 7 - 13 is almost as pointless an exercise as going back and re-recording the original album from scratch. And guess what turned out to be Jarre's next project? Whoops! Writer's block, perchance?Olly Buxto
I never write reviews for anything, but this one was so bad, I couldn't help myself. Everybody has different tastes, but if you like music with any kind of structure or melody at all, you will not like Belladonna. I could not make sense of it at all, it rambled on and on, never getting to the point, never picking a path, never building on a theme. It bored me with it's vague attempts to build a song. I listened to it 2 times just to make sure I wasn't imagining how bad it was, and then I dumped it. It was not my style, and I don't see how it could be anybody's style, but that's just me. I felt obligated to voice my opinion and possible save somebody out there from being bitterly disappointed. Good Luck on your listing adventures
I love the "smoky" piano bar sound of this album.  I picture my best girl having a couple of pops late at nigh
I wanted to give this CD as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie.  I listened to it first to make sure the quality was good. I was so surprised when all I heard was music and no words.  Although the music is nice, I know she would not be too impressed. We had seen the movie together and we loved Mr. Ray's song and wanted to know the words.  It's too bad that I'll have to return or sell it
Item never came.  However in their defense refund was promptly given out.  I only wish that I had a chance to receive this one
I understand why so many people like Dido..She is beautiful, has a decent voice, comes across as a decent human being and is inoffensive...This album is the same - 'inoffensive'...some might say, bland...The tracks that work for me are 'Thank You' (used on Eminem's 'Stan'), but is done solo here and it works, 'Hunter' and 'Here With Me'...The rest just disappear into the background like a passing car...Nothing much happens, nothing inspires...I really want to like her, but it's all been done before..
This is a Cd of the history of the band. Interesting but was not a music CD. Was not worth the price
This will be the third time I have tried to post a review of this unacceptably bad album, and I suppose I have been too harsh, because neither of my previous efforts have been posted. Lets keep this one simple. This is not music, plain and simple. I purchased this due to glowing recommendations from other reviewers on this site, and was terribly disappointed. It basically consists of massively distorted (and detuned) guitar and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with no coherence, structure, or anything approximating the actual ability to play an instrument. Call it performance art, experimental noise, whatever. It's simply not music.
Dan Fogelberg is an extremely talented songwriter and performer. Unfortunately, the songs that get the most radio play are his weaker efforts, songs that seem formulaic and safe. His best songs are the lesser known works -- listeners have to buy the albums in order to hear them. They'll never make it to the pop airwaves. Serious Fogelberg fans will be disappointed by this greatest hits cd. Greatest hits is not synonymous with greatest music.
I love the song NASCA LINES which I first heard on a Putamayo world music CD, so I ordered UNDER ONE SKY since it has Nasca Lines. I figured all the music would be as good, but I was so disappointed. It was very jazzy, which I hate. I'm going back to the Putamayo CDs
I am very dissapointed with this DualDisc, because there is no comment (worning) about DVD region protection. What can I do with this disc - region 1, in Europe (region 2)? My message for Sony Corporation is: "This format will not exist for long with DVD region protection! Sorry.".My first, and last DualDisc. Back to the SACD
While the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded, there are way too many birds around. The CD describes their sound as distant and faint, but that's far from accurate. The parts of the CD where all you hear is the stream alone don't add up to more than 10 minutes, and never last more than a minute. For the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds, rather close and sometimes very loud. Buyer beware: the 30 second samples you get here are precisely from the parts with no birds at all! Very misleading
Once "The Very Best of 10cc" was released in 1997, it was the collection to have.  That collection included 15 tracks that spanned 10cc's career, ending with the Godley and Creme hit "Cry."  So why would this CD be released, especially since the only thing it offers over the prior CD is "Channel Swimmer" and "Don't Hang Up?"  Buy the CD "How Dare You" and "The Very Best of 10cc" and you will have three times the music you have on this CD for only twice the price.  An unnecessary addition to the 10cc portfolio
(With the possible exception of Klemperer's Fidelio.)I am deeply comforted to see from other reviews that others are finally getting the message. As Mr Clinton's campaign team would say, "It's the singing, stupid". Do *not* be mislead by the starry names, this thing barks and yowls like New Year's Eve in the cats-and-dogs home.Do not pass Go, do not waste $35, go directly to Josef Krips on Decca Legends for three discs of perfect joy
This live album/in-studio acoustic EP is hard to figure. Most of the live stuff is selected from BLS's Stronger Than Death album, which wasn't all that great to begin with. The only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of All For You and 13 Years Of Grief sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of No More Tears tries to please, but fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. Unexpectedly, the bonus acoustic EP is the far better attraction. Like A Bird is the best song Neil Young never wrote and Blood In The Well shows Zakk's soloing chops in full form. BLS needed some better songs before doing a live record. End of story
I bought this CD for "Hole In The Earth", a very dynamic, driving and quasi-psychedelic rocker, and mostly got what I expected - more of the same along a continuum, sometimes pushing their envelope in either direction, as I expected. And then I came upon "Pink Cellphone", a rotten apple if there ever was one. This vile little stinker is as if one of the band's groupies wandered into the control room in a methamphetamine haze, defecated on the mixing board, and then described her experience, in no uncertain terms, into an answering machine. If there was ever a reason to switch from buying an artist's complete CDs to just purchasing individual tracks off of the web, this is it. Congratulations, guys, you have not only lodged a very descriptive and literally filthy image into my head, but convinced me, and I'd wager, many listeners, that our faith is ill placed with the musical choices that pop musicians make when assembling their "B" sides. To say nothing of the bad taste and lack of respect for your audience that this demonstrates. Someone should wash the Deftones' mouths out with a bar of soap - maybe a few bars.
I bought two copies of this SACD, both had glitches and would not play in my player correctly, be forewarned. I dont have any other problems with other SACDs so I assume it is in the production somewhere. They would lock up for no reason, this is right out of the box, both copies.
Awful. I mean, really awful...and I liked "Self Portrait" because you knew Dylan was just trying to have some fun with his image. This album is just a disaster. The lyrics are OK on most songs (I've seen worse by Dylan), but the music is unexciting, not very creative, and downright embarrassing on some tracks. Why, oh, why did you have to make an album like this, Bob? Such talented people at your disposal for these sessions, and you threw it away on garbage arrangements. Shameful. Really sad.
This CD was devoid of any of Govi's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work. Frankly, it was just a bunch of New Age background noise that one would hear on elevators. Some of the Craig Chaquico-style stuff was interesting, but better left to Craig. Try 7th Heaven, Mosaico or Guitar Odyssey instead
right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album..so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing, half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks...don't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshamble
Carter Burwell's soundtrack music to Rob Roy was an early sign that he was not just getting it right. The score is all wrong but so is the movie. This movie needed an uplifting score. Carter Burwell could not deliver it
Well it was an obvious path to musical collapse, she should have stopped at Tidal.  If I'd been dating her for the talent she showed on her first CD I would have broken up with her over this piece of haggis.  The course of the last three CD's drew a trendline right from stardom into a melodic pit.  The lyrics on Extraordinary Machine were not only not up to their namesake but worse than the melodies.  The number of great reviews on this site only go to prove once again the masses prefer pablum in lieu of something complex and cognitive.Her original Cd with it's collection of diminished and augmented chords set to deep overlays of texturing, blended with truly poetic lyrics has been replaced with a distilled musical joke.  What on earth gave her the impetus to try to go 'artsy' by experimenting with music predating the second world war I'll never know.  It's obvious her angst is no longer producing art, rather it is being replaced with contrived resolution and the equivalent of a musical epitaph.  Eat it up people, it's all about not having to think.  It's the kind of tripe that happens when someone is trying to hard to think of how to outdo their first brush stroke of genius and is confronted with musical block.  Judging by the news her father is ruining her life and creativity as so often is the case in todays less than feminine half of the culture.  
This album was released in 1999. And now, seven years later, this album does not even matter. Britney Spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her inability to parent a child. Great music lasts dozens of years for its complexity, innovation, creativity, and ability to transcend cultures and generations. Great music stirs something inside the listener, and matters to the person who created it. Britney Spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things. It saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally. And yet, the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years - decades, even - after their release. Music like this, Britney Spears and her peers, disappears into the folds of time. It does not matter.
When will artist realize you can't change the old classics.  The only successfull R group to sing the classic "Night and day" to their own beat was the Temptations CD "What women want" the best rendition I have ever heard.  Smokey does have the voice for these kinds of songs.  Another good CD with classics is Willie Nelson's Stardust
Ignore the unique cover, clever song idea( there is 30) whichrepresent a comic book. Ignore all that. It simply is not good.What is this? I dont even know how to describe this music.It's not even songs, but more a bunch of really short experimental, non-sensequel, inerworkings of annoyance. Theywill start off with a riff as if they are going on to a song,but its only a tease, until they stop and go slow, to say," geton with it!!!!!!!!" Add a bunch of zany sound effects, not tomention the recurring anoyance of a high pitched voice ringingout, sci-fi clips and completly hoarse vocals that are screams,and sounds,that add up,to one of the most pointless albums ever put out
I had high hopes for this cd. I love norwegian metal, and I love viking stuff so I thought this would be great. I was at least hoping it would be good. What I heard was a bunch of uninspired, mediocre, a dime a dozen metal songs. I mean there is enough good to save it from being a total waste, but not enough to give it even 3 stars. The high points are The fate of Norns, The persuit of Vikings, and Arson. These songs are bad @$$ and fun to listen too.An Ancient Sign Of Coming Storm 5.5 just mediocreWhere Death Seems To Dwell 5.5 very repetitiveThe Fate Of Norns 7 This one is pretty good. It has a repetitive punchy opening riff that gets stuck in your head long after listening to it.The Pursuit Of Vikings 7.5 This is my favorite song from this cd. Pretty Bad A$$.Valkyries Ride 5.5 Tedious MonotonyThe Beheading Of A King 5.5 Same as ValkryiesArson 7.5 A bit of a slow starter but it picks up towards the end with some melodic guitarOnce Sealed In Blood 5.5 a bit faster than some but still a downer.All in all nothing horrible, and there is some good songs. The music is a little on the simple side which doesnt necasarily make it bad. I like a lot of simpler music like Darkthrone and Burzum. The problem is that when it comes to simpler stuff I like it to have some really good aptmosphere. That is precisly what is lacking here. I will still listen to it occasionally hoping that it will grow.
This never should've been pressed.  They should've taken the mix and thrown it out.  DO NOT BUY!!
I really think Snoop is a good rapper. He should only have stopped 10 years ago. I'm very tired of his gizzle wizzle nizzle stuff, and I don't like none of the beats here. And what's left then? nothing.I found out after i bought this album:I'm not a snoop fan anymore...Old School is the bes
This Is as Bad as The Film.in Fact Just Like The FIlm The Soundtrack is the same old Formula.WillHis MoviesMusic Never change the same Old Beat.The Rest Of The Soundtrack is just as  bad.UNORIGINALBORING.What A Waste of KOOL MOE DEE
What a load of junk.  GU 29 CD1 was OK.  Everything else these two have done separately is pretty useless.  Make sure you hear a sample before buying this.  Don't say you weren't warned.
But for "The Drugs don't Work," which is marginal at best,this album is boring...cookie-cutter, nothing original
What an outrageous group, how can anyone like this rubbish. Maybe an horde of brainless people. How I feel happy in being intelligent, and live my life with things of absolute quality and not consuming this kind of food for mediocres. How said Romans, "it's just bread and circus to the poors". Give to people what they deserve, rubbish! It's because you mediocre people that buy this, that this kind of people, the members of this group, get money and laughs behind the scenes about how dumb people can be. It's the same horde that buy, Beyonce, Spears, Madona, and other outrageous poor music.   
please make these songs available to listen - with windowsmedia!
I am a huge fan of Thomas Newman but really this CD presents nothing new. It comes across as merely a re-hash of the airy, atmospheric, melody-free cues from his other recent scores. It has none of the originality of American Beauty or Road to Perdition. Frankly, as much as I like his scores, I don't think this warranted a CD release, it's just got too bland and ordinary, no matter how beautifully constructed and pristine it all sounds. A pity
I have to admit that even though i am a big fan of diesel boy, this cd was very boring.  The beats are too similar on every track, and the cd as a whole just has no feeling to it.  If you want to hear him at his best, by 97 octane
From the twang of his guitar to the cowboy hat perched on his head, George Strait is totally and completely revolting. I mean, for goodness sake the man's like 100 years old! How much longer is it going to take for everyone  to realize that? If you like this kind of music, please go to Charter  before you're beyond help. Take this as a warning-don't buy the  cd
Zoolook~ Jean-Michel Jarre is a case where the artist is way to avant-garde for his own best. After having made amazing albums such as Oxygene, Equinox and Magnetic Fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album. I find it a bit too much like modern art, i.e., confusing, confounding and impossible to grasp. It also seems like Jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album. He had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not work. This is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avant-garde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album. Very disapointing indeed!
  I like Machine Head a lot.  Many people disliked "The Burning Red" and called them sell-outs, but I appreciated the effort to make something different.  Then came "Supercharger".  I have listened to it a dozen times, looking for that hook or spark that will get me to listen and love it.  It never came.  This is a bad CD by a great band.
I love Milton Nascimento's early work (Travessia and  Clube Da Esquina), but this does not reach that level by far.  My main objection is that it does not live up to the promise delivered by  the famous names of the participants like Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter,  Pat Metheny a.o. Vera Cruz is OK, but the rest is just too  pretentious. Just as a warning to all Brazilian music lovers out there:  this is certainly not a must have, apart from die hard Milton fans. I would  rather recommend to check out the latest releases by fellow Brazilian  Caetano Veloso (Livro and Prenda Minha), because  they are really indispensable
I remember when this recording came out and Wynton Marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz. I picked it up right away. I was mystified by the souless mimicry of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and Miles' 2nd great quintet--this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz? Listen as Wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements, stopping on a dime! Marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars!! Gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of Think of One that strips the tune of any semblence of swing!!! I get it, Wynton--you've mastered the trumpet, technically speaking, which is no mean feat. And you can read music. Bully for you. The only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say. Ordinarily, I'd feel sorry for you, having wasted all those hours of practice, except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you aren't worthy of washing. People like John Coltrane, Joe Zawinul, Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock...I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. This music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber, thus killing it.
My wife got this CD for me because I like the music from the movie Cast Away.  She saw the words Cast Away in large and prominent print.  She saw the picture of Tom Hanks, very large.  She assumed it was the soundtrack for the movie and not just the 10th track of 10 on  the CD.  In hindsight she should have read the entire panel on the CD.  I guess the producers of this CD didn't think the rest of the music could stand on its own and so they deceptively packaged it this way figuring most people wouldn't waste time returning it.  If you had it listed in the rate column, I would give it a negative rating instead of just the one star
sinceramente, no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas, incluso renombrados artistas, hacia este musico... ungido de la leyenda GRAPE, amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura, esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados..lastima, piedad, curiosidad...no se , me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson (13th.....).. en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio.. en fin, son opiniones, nada mas.  
Great fan of the man they call 'Sugar' Zucchero, but this outing is really below par. This CD consists of rerecordings of older songs, with the addition of other famous singers. Did he send the original recordings to these people, en did they ad little pieces here and there? It sounds like it! None of the songs have gotten' better compared to the originals.To me this cd is a total rip off intended to make easy money (and get more attention for 'Sugar' outside of Italy?). Don't buy it, get 'Oro', 'Shake' or 'Blue Sugar' instead
This cd is, without a doubt amazing.  Stars are lost because prior to recording, you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn NOISE GATE for his guitar rig.  His tone is crushing  sounds perfect, but the second he stops playing, every time SSSSQQQQQQUUUUEEEAAAALLLLL.  It's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once, because it is a chronic problem in every song.
This album bores me out of my mind. Only two decent tracks: Bad boys and Bonnie and Clyde. And I'm no avid radio listener. BET and MTV actually hit the nail on the head with these tracks. So i guess they good for somethin
id advise not to buy the album.  listening to it is like contacting gonorrhea.  trust me ive done both
When I first saw this album I thought "Heavy D....WITHOUT The Boyz?!  That can't be a good thing."  Here's the problem with this album: Heavy D took the "jiggy" route.  When I heard "Big Daddy" for the first time, I thought it was pretty tight and that it had that Heavy D feel to it.  So after hearing that, I went and copped the disc.  When I got home and read the liner notes, my jaw hit the floor.  There was Heavy D....smoking cigars, iced out, and playing the big willie role (the popular theme for the "jiggy" crowd in '97).  At that point, I realized that original MCs were quickly becoming extinct.  After years of success with his group, Heavy D had jumped the fence while simultaneously alienating his fan base all at the same time.  That might not have been such a bad thing had this album been at least somewhat decent.  There are about three tracks on the entire album that are even worth a listen.  There's a lot of lazy and predictable production (we're talking obscene amounts of beat jacking).  On "I'll Do Anything" Heavy D and Tony Dofat COMPLETELY jacked Hall  Oates for their tune "I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)" and it only gets worse throughout the album (I won't even get into how the Gap Band's "Yearnin' For Your Love" was abused on "Keep It Comin'").  There aren't enough good songs on this album to make Heavy's change of heart seem very believable.Avoid this album y'all.  It's not completely terrible, but it comes dangerously close.  There are songs that border on wack and there are songs that are completely wack.  Sadly enough, this can be said for the majority of the songs on this album.  I was very disappointed in Heavy D and lost a little respect for him after hearing this.  I can only reccomend buying this if you can find it used for less than $3.00.  Otherwise, avoid at all costs.Standout Tracks: Big Daddy (My Favorite) and "You Can Get It" feat. The Lost Boyz  Soul For Rea
Aerosmith were one of the worst most annoying bands of all time. They only made 3 decent songs in Same old song and Dance, Seasons of wither, and Janies got a gun. Rest of the songs just stink explosively. Avoid most albums from this hugely overrated band, steven tyler screams, he can't sing at all??? this is music for drug addicts
(it?)I have many of David and Japan's albums, but this thinly composed album is repetitive, boring and annoying. I think there were some hidden tracks too, but I just wanted the album to be over. You are better off with "Dead Bees on a Cake" , "Secrets of the Beehive" or any bee related titled album of his
As you might think, I am not a die hard fan of JMJ, I think that when only die hard fans rates an album, it makes you think that with such a high rating, everybody should love this album and this is not the thruth.Not everybody like this king of musical experimentation, some do but some don't...I like Oxygene and Equinoxe, and even after all those years, they are still good to listen too.  Rendez vous offers some really good moments, but we are far from the perfection as Oxygene or Equinoxe. Rendez-vous is easier to get use to that Zoolook is, but we are far from a near perfect album.  That's all 
The CD came without a CD case and the CD did not play.  I am very disappointed
this cd isnt real good if you like compilations than get the ruff ryders c
Listening to this C.D. first gave me a headache, then it made my stomache churn. It is SO uninspired, it's not even funny (or listenable). Yeah, it's loud, but I can be loud, too, if I had some pots and pans and a "guitar." Don't get this, it's nothing but d-r-i-v-e-l
If I can't buy the cd with ALL THE SONGS that were played in the movie then I won't buy it. I know one cd could cover the entire movie so why can't this be done? Does it concern copy rights and releases
Rhymefest is an Ok rapper and the first two joints are bumping. Man, I thought I was in for a classic hip hop album , It was like the Lakers wereahead by 30 points then all of a sudden the other team caught up and eventually won the game because after that it was just wack track after wack track. I admire his thought provoking lyrics but if the beat ain't hittin I could care less what you're rapping about. Rhymefest used so many R singers I thought I was listening to some old New Edition or After 7 joints not that I don't like those singers but I don't want to hear that on no hip hop album. If you want to hear some real Chicago hip hop check out All Natural the best besides Common to ever come from the city of wind
I love plenty of Contemporary Country music... everything from "New Bluegrass" (Alison Krauss  Union Station) to "New Country" like Reba McEntire, Rascal Flatts, Brad Paisley, Martina... even a lot of Faith  Shania.But I think this CD is crap.The single star is for the only good song on the album, "Heads Carolina, Tails California" -- but really, 1 star for one good song out of ten is a bit too generous.  I'm astounded at how bad the other 9 songs are... elementary-school rhyming, uninspired melody lines, stupid lyrics, below-average accompaniment, etc.One of the most annoying things to me is her habit of overpronnouncing every word in a song... I'd guess someone told her at some point that she slurs her words, and she was trying to overcompensate.  The result should be titled "Hooked on Phonics, starring JoDee Messina."  Listen to the preview of "On a Wing and a Prayer" for a good example of what I'm talking about.I thank my lucky stars I borrowed this cotton candy from the library, rather than shelling out $16 for one song.  Do yourself a favor and buy "Heads Carolina, Tails California" online if you must have it
This is by far the WORST KMFDM RELEASE... No Esch, No Schulz, just Sascha and Skold messin around with a little Pig..   At first listen this album is not bad but once you get used to it, this album is really boring..  Dirty, Skurk, and Preach/Pervert are really the only songs worth listening to.  I was embarrased to listen to "Risen". It was just lyrically horrible I don't know what's wrong with them.  Now in Skold's defense, he is a badass, his voice is cool and he's a good writer his solo album is good.  But we had him in Symbols, Adios, MDFMK, and Attak it was just a bit much. This album is bland at times good and most times pretty bland.  Not what you think when you think KMFDM, though Urban Monkey Warfare is still cool... whatever I am one guy buty it, if you like awesome, if not sorry..
This whole post crap grunge is crap.  If you want real rock check out GNR, ACDC, and any band pre grunge.  I know this is a review but how does this grab ya. Oh and I won't mention the thousands of stupid bands that sing like their trying to go to go to the bathroom. Oh how did we wind up like this?  Exactly what I'm trying to figure out.  Tesla's got more talent then all these bands and they can't get any airplay give me a break
I'm not exactly sure how to classify this, nor do I think it really deserves the time.  How this album has garnered so many positive reviews is beyond me.  My only guess is that some tired, pretentious teen on MySpace raved over it and voila, the clique was born.  Now, I really wanted to like this and gave it numerous listens.  But each time, it sounds more and more like these guys were just doing some busy work around the house, started humming some melodies and then recorded them.  Immature and pretty much unoriginal.  And just because an album is labeled "concept" doesn't automatically qualify it as a masterpiece.  If you want a flawless concept album that actually has an interesting story just go and buy "The Wall".  Unless your circle of friends has threatened to emascualte you for not owning this, don't bother with this bloat. 
The singing is terrible on "Fly Me To The Moon".  Don't take my word for it.  Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com .  At 16 seconds into it, when she sings "all I worship and adore", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes!  Even someone with no musical training can hear it.The rest of the pieces sound fine
OK - let me preface my comments by justifying the 2-star rating...It's Rodney Dangerfield - he was a class act.  As for the CD:  If you're looking for a few songs by a comedian accompanied by someone's cheesy clavinova, then this CD is for you.  I bought this because of the last track, "Rappin' Rodney", and boy was I disappointed. It sounds like it was recorded from an old worn out cassette.  Do yourself a favor - get all of Rodney's DVD's with his standup material and remember him for what he was - a comedy legend
I received this 2CD set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called "mastering".  I have original un-mastered copies of some REO Speedwagon albums that sound BETTER than this set!  I love REO to death and the track listing is good to go, but in all honesty, this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality.  The band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for.  I cannot recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close.  Save your money and wait
Hysteria.**I see great polarities in the reviews of this record. I fall in the camp that sees this as a overproduced microtargeted superficial pop record designed for radio and MTV. I consider that shrewd writing  marketing. Brilliance is a term I'll reserve for Led Zeppelin.I tend to like my rock harder, with two arms and less cheesy. Sadly, this record doesn't fit the bill. For that, Pete Willis era Def Leppard suits me much better.I don't need to give you a song breakdown by breakdown. The important factor here is what you enjoy. If you enjoy superficial 1980s MTV pop or mindblowing heavy rock - that distinction will determine your opinion here. This album is definetly the former.I'll beg to differ with the Amazon reviewer - it *DOES* sound dated. Its a record thats signifigant for its hype. When listened for its depth. It is symbolic of the later part of the decade which it was released.Prepare to be transported back to the spandex era on plopping this disc in
Most of these idiot reviewers are missing the fact that this CD is missing lot of songs which define Extreme.  The implication that it is a Best of and not a Greatest Hits should have included more from their self-titled album.  Tsk-tsk, this doesn't include Mutha (Don't Wanna Go to School Today), how can that be
Oh man, this sucks really bad. Good thing nu-metal is dead. THRASH METAL IS REAL METAL, this is for posers
 There's always the argument that if Bach had had a modern piano, he would have composed for it. Let's consider another possibility: if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to Bach's doorstep, he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea, since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the High Baroque composers.For listeners who understand what Bach meant by equal temperament, it's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what Bach was trying to demonstrate in these "pedagogical" compositions. In other words, the point is lost.
To much guitar, drowns out all the other instruments.  Survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums, not guitars.  I was expecting another Burning Heart, Is this Love, High on you.  No songs on this albums have that sound.  The vocals by Jamison are top notch, but none of the songs sound like the Survivor I remember.  Survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards, bass and drums, not drive the whole song. I guess Jim Peterik was the man behind Survivor all along.  I give the CD 2 stars for Fire makes Steel, the rest are throw aways.  ***Recommended for die hards only*** I highly recommend 'When Seconds Count' for anyone getting started with Survivor
If you are short on money, do not buy this C.D.  You will regret it.  However if you are trying to get rid of a gift voucher or something side one is really good, especially the Dr. Evil just the two of us.   Really this is not a good album, as side two is rubbish.  I still haven't  listened to it all the way throug
When John Cipollina was in the lineup and he and rhythm guitarist Gary Duncan were in the groove, there was no better sounding group than QMS. Cipollina's talent was awe inspiring. Unfortunately, one of Quicksilver's overbearing and domineering members ways led to Cipollina's departure. Without Cipollina, QMS sounded like just another mediocre rock group, despite the talents of Duncan, Freiberg and Elmore. I saw them at the Hollywood Palladium 33 years ago and can verify this.If you want to hear them at their best, buy the 1st album, Happy Trails, or Lost Gold and Silver
Yes, she has a great voice, but this entire CD is so overproduced, so lifeless, so very boring that I had to force myself to listen to the entire thing - searching desperately for a track that measures up to the voice. She sounds as bored as I was on every song. I hope she wakes up soon before we all fall asleep
Nana has a beautiful voice, but her singing is monotonous, predictable.  She lacks passion. Sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of  really interpreting the song. In addition to this, the arrangements are  unfortunately very poor. Her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra.  Only love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner with  candles, but this is not the album I would like to listen to again and  again
As a Gene Autry fan, particularly of his Christmas recordings, I was really looking forward to this release.  But...what a disappointment!  I will look over the dropouts - obviously the source tapes have deteriorated - but what happened to the final three cuts?  They are so laden with noise reduction artifacts that they are barely listenable.  And, I know the disc is short, but were the 2 second pauses between tracks REALLY necessary?  Talk about choppy. No flow at all. This CD did make me do one thing...go back into my archives and pull out my original Grand Prix vinyl.  I think I'll be doing a transfer and retire this CD to the bottom shelf.
Blues singers shouldn't try to go mainstream. If they do try and succeed, fine. That means they've stayed true to their roots. When they try and fail (as Susan has done with Hope and Desire), one would hope they'd try to get back to where they started. For me that was Just Won't Burn. I guess when one is happily married with children, it's hard to sing the blues since you're not feeling them . . . you're faking them
Gonzalo is a fantastic pianist.  This CD however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side.  However, it is languid and the tunes don't stand out.  It is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments - if driving later in the day.  I have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste.  But it is exciting.  Not here.  There is barely a hint of any Cuban influence in this music as well.  Now some will like the gentleness I suppose, but with weak material and not much diversity, it sits pretty flat with me
Will not run on my computer... love the content however I keep my music on my hard drive and was looking forward to working out with this album on my MP3.  I will be demanding a refund!  DO NOT BUY if you have a MP3 supported car stereo, if you plan on playing at your computer.. IT WILL NOT WORK DUE TO ILL CONCEIVED PIRACY PROTECTION!!!!!!!!!!!
Not his best stuff. He's running short of lyrical ideas, he recycles his own lines, like Star Wars recycles "I have a bad feeling about this".Beats are usually cool, I don't care for the popish tracks with the singing. I didn't mind it so much when he sang REALLY BAD back on his first album, but now it's no longer funny, it sounds like pop.Anyhow, organized religion is crap. I thought KRS understood this back in the day. What happened? Now he's got his own little organization and his own little phylosophy, and his only little diciples and crap, I dunno, it's posative, but then again it's gay like some of his modern tracks.Anyhow it is cheap, if you have to finish off your collection as I do, then buy it, otherwise go buy his anything BoomBap on back. Or check out:Kool KeithEl-PGang StarrMr. LifJedi Miind TricksPublic EnemyNon PhixionSir MenelikMost of which is better than KRS' latest works
The Easy Language 16 is only useful if you're already familiar with the language you wish to learn.  I've been studying French for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when I'm getting rusty.  The only problem is that it's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear.  The recorded speakers also don't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said.  This is good cause it's like listening to an actual French speaker and not a robot, bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said.  It will also go over basic French grammar but is totally useless if you don't already know basic French grammar.      I also tried to use this to learn Japanese.  Unlike French, I'm not familiar with the Japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare.  If all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a Romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out.  Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese.  For instance, in the grammar section it has the past, present and future "I am"  it's written in english then beside it it's written in Japanese.  You can't click them to have it sound out for you.  In the Japanese alphabet section all it has is the Japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out.  So it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in Japanese.  I do want to learn how to read, write and speak Japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read, write, and speak Japanese!   So my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with Japanese (NOT the Romanized(Romanjj) version) already in order to use this product.  Because of my experiences with this product I would say get it only if you know the languages you're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more.  Since I am familiar with French this product was pretty helpful but if I used this as a starter for the language I probably would have quit.  I'm searching Amazon for better Japanese books. So if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and CD's
My boss asked me to get this, so that he check out the Latin portion of it.What a waste!  The only Latin on this CD is *Latin* American Spanish.The interface was underwhelming. I needed to guess at what did what, because the controls are mostly icons. What's worse, there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program. Apparently though, the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back.  If you are learning the differences between US and UK English, its there!I gave this one star, only because I couldn't give it no stars
I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed
They have the hebrew backwards!! You are supposed to read hebrew right to left-the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right. I find it extremely confusing. I know how to read hebrew and I wanted to learn how to speak it.What a poor effort!
I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole, and I, too, couldn't find it.  There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole... except the jewel case which insists it's there.  I'm so dissapointed I haven't actually tested anything else out:  I consider this a VERY bad start
I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole, and that's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd. When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole, even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case. So it has been a complete waste of money for me, perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars.It also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language, but that is not possible either, u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source. I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product. If anyone can find creole on this cd I would be happy to stand corrected.PS I contacted IMSI and they say the cd's were mislabelled, there is no haitian creole on the cd, despite the fact that it is listed on the cover
This dude is selling info that you can learn from ANYONE with VERY LIMITED computer knowledge.  All of the same info is on the net for free.This product exists for one purpose... to steal from you.This pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission.  He could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product... but scams seem to be his thing.  AVOID!!  This is the WORST company that I have ever delt with in my ENTIRE life.  This John guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed.  He is an embarrasement to his company and his family.  At least a mugger steals from me face to face... this snake is sneaky about it
Imagine that you know so little about a computer that you wouldn't even be here reading this review.These discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded, dial, yellow wall phone. If you are a recent (one hour ago) immigrant from a sixth world country, and you need to forward the "Burger King Christmas Song", well, then you're already ahead of these "learning" CDs. (My apologies to grandmothers with corded, dial, yellow wall phones). (Actually, I kinda wish I had one!) Regards, Older But No Smarter
When I first installed the program I was able to access the images, but since that first time I haven't. My operating system is XP and I don't know if that is the problem with the software. I have since then uninstalled it. I did not think this product was very easy to use
I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.  I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling.  If I were a small business, I would be out of business.  All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable
Im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.  After picking up Illustrator however, Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers.  Ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people: those who "get" vector graphic programs, and those who errrr...dont. Unfortunately, after 10 hours use and much manual reading, I fall into the later category. I dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course. This decision was supported by friends proficient in its use - but who had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts to me. (Indeed, defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science!)So my advice is this: Be extremely carefull if youve never used Illustrator before. It may be a breeze to those well versed in its use, but to an absoloute beginner its an extremely difficult program to grasp and you may be dissapointed to find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars for it. 
This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9. Opens files that I've been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable 'saved' versions. Crashes. Can't save for mysterious reasons. Writes "version 10" files with text split into pieces.Such a fine product! Really glad I paid money for it!!I downgraded back to Irritator 10
I assumed, incorrectly, that Adobe's customer service would be professional and quick. I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone. When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!!  Adobe's call center is easily the worst customer service I have dealt with -- and I've dealt with some bad customer service
I use PDFs a lot and I must say that quite often I turn to Free PDF software to actually do the tasks that Acrobat fails to do. One area I have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes Acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so I switch to the Free PDF software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use.However if you are a pro PDF maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then I recommend this product hands down as the best one. I just find that it is not always the best PDF software package in the world, but a good one all the same.I would not recommend buying this one just to make standard PDF files alone. If you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right.
This product could put user/customer's life at risk. The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road. This is the worst product that I have used in my life.
The only redeeming quality about this GPS system is that it's cheap.  I used it on a 1,000 mile trip on the east coast the week after I got it.  The navigation is poor. I found that I often had to look over to the laptop screen because I was "off route" so often due to the poor maps. The system repeated the same annoying problems that I see in other feedback.1) The unit would show me being off the road even though I was on an Interstate. In this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around. 2) It directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction.  3) It could not locate a POI that turned out to be a few hundred yards away  4) It often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination  5) It doesn't provide a chime when it's time for a turn.  It will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead, but that might be the last time you hear an instruction.6) In one case, it got me to my destination (at least close enough) but couldn't guide me back to my starting point.The GPS receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well. But the maps are poor, as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980's computer generated voice.If you're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this ISN'T it.This is going back asap.
I rarely write reviews but I decided to write this since I had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad.  The review by "Reviewer: RC Lansing Mich" has listed all of my frustrations and I will not go over them again.  But the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review.  The summary of this product is that it is "highly unusable".  You will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again.  Yes, you can "manage" you way with this product.  However it is not worth your time and money.And last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database ... the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps, based on locations they have travelled, not covered by the original map database ... come on!
I have used MS streets and trips 2005 and 2006 for over a year. It has some map errors that I wish were updated. I read that The Delorme Street Atlas was far superior, so I bought it. It only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems. Not only is the mapping way out of date (Many years) Microsoft Streets and trips 2006 Maps are far more up to date. On many occasions told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even when the road doesn't exist in that direction. It doesn't even know the name of some very old roads Displays..."Unknown Name" While driving on very old established roads it tells me to turn onto a road that is actually an elevated overpass that I am driving 30 feet below. The program actually wanted me to get back on the freeway by making a U-turn from an off ramp to an on ramp. I have used Microsoft streets in all of these same areas and it is much more usable. The Delorme is very confusing and frustrating. I'm sending it back for a full refund
There's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted. This is definitely one of the worst products I have ever bought. I did not do much research. I think the data may be in there, but I could not learn how to make it work. The interface is horrific - unusable. Don't do it
I was expecting a lot more from these two CD's. It teaches you a few items of food, basic words like "Hello", Please" and "airplane" and even teaches you to ask "Where are the suitcases"... but then that is about it. I was really hoping for more... much more
Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. (For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)
This software didn't quite do what I expected.  I was somewhat disappointed when I discovered that it wouldn't convert iTunes m4p music files to MP3 files to run on a REAL Player. 
Did not work with my apple computer,requested help but did not get results I wanted which was to return idem  get credi
The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review
This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this.  It adds virtually nothing to XP.  Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition.  That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product.  The themes are nice but far too few for the price.  The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things.  The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.  Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff.  Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money
I purchased this software thinking that I could take my digital images, create a slide show with music, and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch.Unfortunately, the disk that I got gave me some error messages that when I called tech support (one hour hold time)they told me that my error message meant that I could create files, but they'll only run on my computer, not on my tv dvd player. In addition, you need to buy additional dvd burning software, because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the Microsoft logo on them. (The package says the dvds will run on almost any dvd player)So I asked for my money back. However, since it took me more than 30 days to find all of this out, they refused a refund.
By reading the cover I thought it would be a great product to have. It indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without. Games - Bowling game is actually a teaser version. You can play only two lanes. Others cost you extra. Two other games are not exciting.Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre.I liked the analog convertor but not too much. If you can get input from any audio device, this program can convert it into a digital format. Alas it doesn't convert to MP3 format. Also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast, but not on the normal speed.Dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions. I liked Ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing.Bottom line - I don't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week.
Warning! I resized my partition and when it restarted my computed could not boot. It destroyed my system and I had to format my whole drive.Read all the reviews from this program carefully. I read them but did not believe them
I have to qualify this review by saying that I do not own PM 8.0, so I cannot fairly give a rating, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews. I can only relate personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I do own and have used PM 6.0 since '01 when it was still Powerquest instead of Norton/Symantec and it has worked very well, though the GUI is a bit quirky. I have run it with 2 drives, one with 98SE and XP Pro, with PM loaded on 98SE partition and it did everything I needed on both drives. Trouble is, version 5.0 is, AFAIK, not compatible with XP and since M$ no longer supports 98SE, we have a problem, Houston. Currently I am  using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed. If I get a drive partitioning software product compatible with XP, it most assuredly WILL NOT BE ANYTHING PRODUCED BY NORTON/SYMANTEC, based on these reviews and personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I first bought a computer in '98 and used Norton Antivirus 5.0. At that time, Norton was probably the best antivirus product out there. It worked flawlessly and I used and recommended it for years. NO MORE. I purchased a copy of Symantec System Works 2005 right after it was released. Long story short, I no longer use Norton products because I got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become, and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores. There is one lone Symantec product I still use---Windoctor, which is not installed on my 'puter but ran from the CD as needed.  Adios, anything else produced by Norton/Symantec. It ain't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin.
I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.       I am sorry that I did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by Symantec for other products that I have purchased from them.   All I wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my C: drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive.    I was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with Symantec Technical Support.   I was only able to speak to technical support staff in India who finally told me that they could not solve my problem, but that I would be called back by a senior engineer.  It never happened despite repeated promises.  I finally gave up and returned the product to Symantec for a refund.
I am an experienced computer user, and I bought this primarily on my previous experince with Symantec products, which had been good.  My experience with this product was unfortunately, very poor.First - the product claims to be able to clone your boot partition, but this failed repeatedly, creating cloned partitions which were not bootable.  Second - Tech support failed to provide an answer for days while I eventually figured out myself that I needed to use the bootable media to make a clone of my system disk - something the windows application was happy to try and fail at without warning.  Even when I attempted to provide this information to tech support so they could answer similar questions for others, they didn't get what I was saying and sent me another form letter response detailing how to make a copy (instructions which failed of course).Third - On another occasion, even using the bootable media, I got the error "1517" when attempting to clone by boot partition.  Searching the web revealed others having this problem, and Symantec tech support full of bogus solutions for it.Fourth - no support for USB/Firewire drives with the bootable media.On the plus side - it did resize partitions I asked it to without trouble (I give it one extra star for something working)
Attempted to upgrade from 97 to 2003... bad move... none of my access 97 programs work now... in fact I, I brought home a 2003 access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions... nope... the upgrade just didn't work.....had to purchase a full version to set things right... save your money on this product..
Why are the newer products getting slower by the version. I still love Version 5. It does not forever to open up in a Web browser..Update: I have been using Version 7 now for several months.. I am glad to say that I am now a lot happier. Granted it still uses a lot of memory. However, the new features that it has compared to Version 5, makes the upgrade worthwhile. However, watch out.. there are several features that Adobe took out from the Standard version and only has on the PRO version..
Being familiar with some Adobe products, we opted to try this at work as a cheaper alternative than some other packages for simple web graphics work.  Boy, were we disappointed.Simply put, this tool is not so much a tool, but a hindrance.  Utilities such as transparencies, are not only difficult to make work properly, but hidden in non-intuititve locations.  Dialogs are non-standard, which requires getting used to strange layouts in design.  While seeminly small for just a couple items I've mentioned, multiply this by the supposed feature set of the product and you start to get an idea of how cumbersome the tool really is.As has been mentioned by plenty of other people, it is also slow.  If you want a simple image viewer, find anything else - even freeware, as I have never come across an image utility that takes so long to load, regardless of it is the first time or the umpteenth time.While I could go on about the unsatisfactory qualities of this product, I will simple reiterate what others had also said; it is cumbersome to use, slow to use and load, un-intuitive with poor layout and design, and lacks many basic features one would expect in this form of utility.
I am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0.  Performance is very poor, especially the organizer.  It's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are, such as Mac iPhoto and even the Canon software that came with my camera, compared to Elements.  Recently, I've been getting lots of crashes, though everything else on my system is completely stable.  The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality, when it works correctly
I bought this software primarily so I could create slideshows with music and other special effects. Since I got it, I have had nothing but problems. First of all, it would not install completely on my computer. The techs at Adobe could not figure out the problem. After I reformatted my hard drive, I finally got Photoshop to install properly. Then another problem. When I burned my slideshow photos to a VCD, they came out just awful (unlike Adobe's demo video showing a perfectly created  slideshow.) Boy, was I deceived! I cannot say that this software is all bad. It does a nice job in correcting exposure errors in digital photos. However, if you want to create neat slideshows, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is not worth the cost
JUNK! I am a professional photographer and have used 2.0 for years for quick fixes and easy additions, thinking they might have made some improvements to make life easier... I was wrong. This program is a step back. I was a refund! I don't know who is writing they like this new version, but buyer beware! Laur
Crashed the system every time I tried to use it...   gave me such a headache I tossed it in the trash...
I just purchased the Hallmark Card Studio 2004 (...).  Everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card, the first side printed fine, but when printing the next side I keep getting the "this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down".  I have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far.  I have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed.  I am running windows 98SE.  I will probably be returning this to the store (if possible).  It looked to have some nice cards on it, which is basically all I wanted it for, but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer. 
The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims 4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions. That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly cards for all occasions means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own
I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception.  Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves.  I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least.  I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer.  I have been more than patient with this software.  It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs.  And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue.  As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE. 
I have a Compaq Presario laptop with Windows ME. I wanted to upgrade it, so I decided to buy the Windows XP Upgrade. I have another computer that came with XP built in, and I like that system a lot.Well, before I purchased this software, I specifically asked the manager at CompUSA if there are any problems upgrading from Windows ME to Windows XP. I was very specific. "No problem!" he told me, "It works great!"NONSENSE!Here is a list of hardware problems I had after loading Windows XP onto the laptop:1. My touch pad stopped working.2. My PCI bus started getting errors.3. My wireless network card (D-Link GW-630) stopped working.And these are just the things I noticed in the first day of using it!I spent over six hours on the telephone with various technical service reps at Microsoft, uninstalling and re-installing the software, being put on hold, reinstalling drivers, restarting the computer over and over and over and over again... Six extremely frustrating hours!Finally, the tech support people told me to uninstall the software. They said I should return the software to CompUSA.Now for the fun part. CompUSA refused to take it back!!! After arguing with the very same manager who told me everything should work great, all I got was an offer to do an exchange for the same product. Then the manager said my system must not be compatible. Well, I showed him the "System Requirements" on the box, where it says "Windows ME."  According to the box, my laptop is perfectly compatible!  But apparently it's not.Then the manager told me that he would not recommend upgrading from ME to XP. Well, intyeresting he says that now!  I reminded him about our conversation!!!I even gave the manager my Microsoft Case Number so he could see for himself the problems I had and all the tech support people who tried to fix it for me.In the end, I am stuck with software that does not work.Learn from my trials. Do not buy this software if you have Windows ME. Only buy it if you can get a written agreement from your seller that they will take the software back after it messes up your system
Don't take my word for it that's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on Slashdot. Be warned: Adobe has not learned its lesson, and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6, this latest release of Acrobat continues Adobe's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment, again, as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done--in fact, it's now nearly impossible. Like earlier releases, this version of Acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop "right click" menus. Adobe argues that these are conveniences, but they are entirely unnecessary (for most of us "printing" to Adobe PDF achieves the same result, is much more convenient, and a more natural model), and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface (for those who don't have the knowledge or patience to customize it) or a carefully tuned one (for those who do). Unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior (e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog), Acrobat's "option" for disabling this behavior, once deeply hidden in the setup process,is now almost completely absent. To disable the "Convert to Adobe PDF" button that mysteriously appears in the Outlook mail editor, for example, one has to be sure to choose "this feature will not be available" from the "Microsoft Outlook" option under "Acrobat PDFMaker" under "Create Adobe PDF". Simply deleting the button using Outlook's toolbar customization feature will not work: it comes right back when the editor is next opened. Similar problems arise in Word, Excel, Visio, Project, and Internet Explorer. And there's simply no way to get rid of the never-used "Convert to Adobe PDF" and "Combine in Acrobat..." entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files (even if one installs none of the Acrobat PDFMaker features). For the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that Acrobat 7 does, there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web, but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7: ("Adobe has really pushed the boat out with Acrobat 7 and managed to screw Word royally") . In short, Acrobat will make a mess of your working environment, there's no way to completely fix it, and even the partial fix is a pain (and not well documented). (This may seem a minor issue, but if every application followed Adobe's reckless example, our working environments would start to look like strip malls, crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it. One of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs; no application should interfere with that.) Experienced Acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for Acrobat (and most other Adobe applications): it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version. In fact, on my 2 GHz Pentium 4, it takes longer to launch than the entire Visual Studio .NET development environment, and longer than the boot sequence for Windows XP! There are other minor problems as well (arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items, etc.) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough. Unless you really need the latest Acrobat features, you should probably avoid this upgrade. And if the "improvements" in this release are any indication of where Adobe plans to go with future releases, it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management. Fortunately, there's no reason at all to upgrade. Version 7 offers no usefully new features, so you can (and should) avoid this one (at all costs)
If you use Microsoft Office (Word, Excel) don't buy it!  Links to your previous .pdf simply don't work.  Adobe knows about it, but have no viable work around.  Stick with prevous versions. 
Obviously bogus reviews.  Version 6 was slow as a dog, so any improvement will make this more interesting.  Of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting.  What about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5?  how bout tossing us all a bone
In an effort to boost their file numbers and appear to be more comprehensive, the creators included many VERY low resolution images that they "artsied" or "roughed" up with a dirty polaroid-transfer effect, or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides, which they must have hoped would excuse the poor quality of the original image.  For example, if you do a search for "tiger", you will get 165 results, but only 86 will be of the animal, (and not one of 20 images of 10 toy tigers, or 5 images of one tiger-striped chair-cushion and so on), and of those 86, 80 have the crusty effect applied to them.  The other 6 tigers have been taken out of those same 80 images and clipped out of their background to give you a floating tiger on a clump of grass or a tiger head (but have, thankfully, not been "dirtied" up with the transfer effect).  Out of all, there is NOT ONE clean image of a tiger in its environment.Here is another example.  A search for "sunset" yields 247 results.  Of these, 163 have the crusty polaroid transfer effect applied, and 70 are the same images duplicated (much smaller) in a sloppy stack of 5 slides. There are TWO clean sunset images.These are typical results.  Numbers don't mean anything!  This product is stuffed with multiple images of toys, frankly not-so-attractive people from hard angles, and old low-resolution stock photos to achieve 150,000 files. Would it have killed them to include ONE clean, print-resolution image in each category? Perhaps we could have done without 50 of the fake slide images (talk about dated anyway!) in order to get a product worth having around
First of all, the many samples I viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles. There are far fewer images than the number touted. This is a scam in my opinion, but a situation I could live with.But The major issue is that most of the photo images I have searched for my actual use have very poor, actually totally unusable resolution. They have corrupted clarity, Poor pixel quality, are distorted, and unsuitable except for perhaps, a third grader's school project.It was a complete waste of money. It is headed for the first garage sale I hold, and I will offer it for 50 cents with a non-return policy.
This product is very nice when it works.  However, I'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me.  When I attempt to export the image - either by saving, draging or copying, Hemera places a transparency over the object, making the product worthless.  I gave it two stars because, for the two months it worked, it worked well, however, now, it won't work at all.  And as the other reviewer stated, support is nearly non-existant
This product offers much to chose from and I really liked the photos. However, I have yet to get this program to work right. I am able to view the photos but when I go into the the Export Wizard to save the photos, the photo has a transparency over the top of it, instead of in the background. I tried bypassing the Export Wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving. This also inserts the transparency over the photo. I called Hemera in Canada and they instructed me to call Encore USA in CA for support. Encore USA said they couldn't help me. Encore's technical support is "limited to crashes, error messages and lockups". I also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or FAQ's. There was VERY little about this software and no help to be found. I wasted my money on a product I can't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control.
I thought this would be a good product for my computer.  I didn't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download.  During the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove (uninstall/delete) all of your known antivirus, spyware, and firewalls from your computer prior to install.  This leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message.  I received an error message that prevented me from completing the download. I purchased the software on Aug 3 and called customer support, they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue.  They were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans.  Microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support, those that know the basics and those that know more. they asked me to set up a time span when I would like to receive a call from the "teir II" agents, I chose 6-9pm.  I received several calls over the next two weeks, all of them were outside of the specified time.  I missed several of them because I have a career and a life. When I finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue.  Here it was, two weeks after I purchased the software, I still did not have what I needed.  I was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software.  I called in several times druing the ordeal and the "teir I" agents just told me that I have to wait for the call, "they'll get to it when they get to it."  I was very upset with the customer support, I have no idea how the product is, but the customer support is just horrible.  Go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the "post your own thoughts" page through member accounts, you'll see that I'm not alone in this issue.  I have since purchased other software that cover what Microsoft says it will with onecare.  I did not have one problem with these installs.  Please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you cannot download due to a problem with your operating system (seperate from onecare).  This costs an additional $35 ontop of the cost for onecare
I bought this product after reading the other on-line reviews saying how easy it was to use. I am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy! It was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke! I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you're a professional architect/ computer genius
This program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details. I'm only using it for a simple garage and I expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions. Not so. You might as well pick up a copy of The Sims so you could at least have some fun with it. If you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it, forget it. Very disappointing waste of money
1. You can't print on anything over 8.5x14 paper.  Useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale.2. I bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3.0 of Broderbund 3D Home Architect.  It turns out that this is exactly the same software!I strongly recommend looking for something better
I was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool, but ended up disappointed.  They definately oversell it as an interior design tool.  Looking at the brochure online, I really think they must have touched up the images, because I don't see any way that they could have created them with this product.  As a matter of fact, the website Punch Interior Design software package implies that they did just that.The reason I don't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great.  I wish all software had that.  
As is typical with software claiming to be "topo", it is not. Expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for USGS quads this software is not as advertised.Since I own the other major competing program (for which you need to buy each state in order to get Quads (and for which I can not seem to find Wyoming)), I was eagerly awaiting this package.  In five minutes I realized Delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker/mountain biker (et al). You can order quads very simply using the package, but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at Delorme decided they would make the map blank (apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece).  So, you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it.  Well, if I knew that, I would already own the quad, and certainly wouldn't need to buy an electronic version.  For 2.50 more I could get it laminated.Yes, this is a flame, but it is deserved. Delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go (and then download, and pay for, the appropriate map).All in all, a complete waste of money--I only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers of such software get a clue and discover a more appropriate business model (versus selling blank maps, with a 100 dollar credit for maps that you don't even know will work)Cheers.
This computer system, although almost universally accepted, can be beaten in quality and flexibility by an operating system that can be downloaded for free, such as the fedora project (a distribution of linux, a OS which can be changed by anyone for free), or bought from software company supporting these open source project with unlimited customer support for around �50 ($90) or less
Windows XP, and basically any other windows based OS is junk. After using Windows 3.1, 95, 98SE, 2000, ME, and XP, I was getting very sick of the same old boring basic programs.Linux however, has tons of programs with a lot of extra features to it.Spellcheck is one. I have to buy Microsoft Word or some other office program for spell check, and how much?!?! I'll tell you one thing, it ain't free.Linux however, there is spell check, and not just in their word processor. I also found this in their messenger program, email, and even in web browsers, free!The other thing I hate about Windows is "You must activate your copy, and only one copy per computer".With linux, there is no activating, or "one per computer". You don't have to fear changing hardware and having to call in to reactivate, typing in a ton of numbers and answering questions. You can give someone a copy of linux, and they can try it, for free, and for life! It's not 30 days free, or free for only a few people, it's free for everyone for life!As for one who mentioned that Linux releases more fixes than Windows, that is true. The difference between Windows and Linux when it comes to releases is like this. When Microsoft finally gets the operating system done enough, they will release it.Linux will release free their OS/software right away. You can download it right away as it becomes available or simply wait until they fix the bugs.So in other words, let's say both OS's have the same software. Day 5 comes along, and this software pretty much works, but may have some bugs.Linux will release this, and you have the "option" of installing it and trying it out, or wait until more bugs are fixed.Windows will not release this until it is more offical and finished.This is why linux has a lot of patches, they give it to you when they first get it going, and as they continue to improve this, you can enjoy it right away and not have to wait so long.It is also true that Windows can be attacked by viruses within hours, where as linux can take several days/weeks/months.Also, Linux has been proven to give your hardware/computer a longer life span.It can also work better with older hardware so you don't have to be compelled to upgrade all the time.Why not try out linux? It's a lot cheaper, and you may be amazed by how great it really is. I prefer Mandriva 2006. It's a great system.Final note -Windows: Very costly, even more so to get the benefits/featuresLinux: FreeWindows: One per computer, or buy more licensesLinux: One copy to everyone for life, or each person can have a copy for lifeWindows: Boring; basic programsLinux: Several programs, multiple browsers, more than one type of software to fit your needs.Windows: New hardware/reformat PC: You must spend time on phone and answer questions and type in SEVERAL numbers to activate your PC.Linux: New hardware/reformat: Here's your OS installed; you're good to go!Windows: Constantly gets attacked by virusesLinux: Quite a lot saferWindows: Support? lol. Yeah, there may be someLinux: Various sites where you can ask questions for free and get help on your OSThat's just some of the reasons why I love linux
The Mac OS, $129 list, often cheaper, doesn't get viruses, worms, malware, etc and probably runs all the software you do on a PC, with the exception of some games. Go to a Mac Store and try it for yourself
Sorry to disappoint the believers, but this OS is way overpriced for what it does.  And, it will dominate you instead of the converse
This is Microsoft's most stable OS yet, but ridiculously over- priced.  I'll admit, I'm no fan of Microsoft, but I've very few problems with my desktop once I upgraded from Windows me
They sent me a product that wasn't legit and wouldn't take it back. Horrible service  I don't recommend anyone buy from this particular vendor! Just a horrible waste of time  MONEY
What a complete pain! ..... We now use Macs. However, I decided to take the California bar examination July 2006. The California bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by Examsoft. Presently, the software will only work on Windows XP. Moreover, the California bar examiners will not allow any Macs, even the newer Macs with the Intel processors which require complete re-booting into Windows.As a result, I was forced to upgrade my Gateway laptop, a fine laptop as far as PCs are concerned, in order to sit for this bar examination. (That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.) THANK GOD FOR GATEWAY COMPUTER TECHNICAL SUPPORT AS THE MICROSOFT FOLKS ARE CLUELESS:Even though the warranty on my Gateway laptop expired some time ago, Gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than I can possibly discuss here. Conversely, Microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected. .....I suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software (any new software) will only work with the newer versions of Windows XP or Vista, and since Vista will be such a memory hog, consumers eventually will be forced to dump their PCs which cannot be upgraded, for new PCs.As for how the operating system actually works: a grade of Fair. YESTERDAY, THE MICROSOFT UPDATE WEBSITE WAS DOWN WHICH, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT'S DISCUSSION WEBSITE SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM WITH OTHER WINDOW USERS AS WELL. Typical
I received the package and read the instructions.  In retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well.  It did not.  My installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless.  I had to take it to a professional to get it going.  Even so, I have had problems with Internet Explorer stopping suddenly, BSOD's.  This is not a job for the average computer user
It is now almost a month since I bought the upgrade to XP Prof. for my destop computer running W2K Prof. I have had nothing but trouble. My notebook computer, connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months, suddenly could not connect to the desktop. All network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing. I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood. Nonce could fix the problems and they are now "researching" the problem and supposed to call me this morning. During one of the calls, the tech. tried to blame it on my notebook. If any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company, you'll ercognize the situation. Right now, I would prefer getting a refund and returning to W2K
First of all, Microsoft needs to come down on their prices (Not that this will ever happen). I build computers for a living, and I'd say that 9 times out of 10 Windows is the single most expensive piece of any PC I build. That being said, XP has come a long way. Service pack 2 has done wonders for security. I also found it is the most stable version of Windows I've used to date. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. It still lets in it's share of "germs", stops responding from time to time (hangs), and it's very slow to shut down. The built-in CD writing software is TERRIBLE and Remote Desktop is not always a pleasure to use either. However, the biggest problem I've had so far is with product activation. As a PC technician, I'm always testing new parts. The most annoying problem I've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes (let's say you replace a video card, a hard drive and add some memory) all within a certain period of time (180 days maybe?) Windows makes you reactivate. This becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time. It makes you call Microsoft, where you have to convince the representitive that you're not trying to steal from them. Then you have to read them a long number (I think 41 digits) and then they'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in. It's driven me to the point of using Windows 2000 again to test my parts, even though this isn't always practical for testing XP compatibility. Overall, I feel that I paid too much for this operating system.
There are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w/ specific components of the Toshiba Satellite M45-S355. The hardware incompatibility issues w/ the DVD-RAM drive, the GL910 chipset, and the SoundMax integrated audio drivers are known to both Microsoft Technical Service personnel and their counterparts at Toshiba. I spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies (both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as "English"). The Amazon representative with whom I spoke was in New Delhi. I ultimately figured out (on my own) which Toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded (again consuming hours of download time with a 56K modem), and I used an Iomega CD-Rom USB external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours. I was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install Small Business Accounting 2006. Don't buy these products unless you absolutely MUST. Microsoft's "technical service" is a euphemism more aptly meaning "technically useless". There is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of Microsoft XP Professional. I should also mention that both the Toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from Amazon
...for InDesign to not have one basic features. Everyone I know still does french folds, but in order to see double page spreads in InDesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program, then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page, layout by layout. This is mortally stupid. At this point Adobe should have figured how a tool like I.D. is actually used in conjunction with a printer, not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen. The oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool. Why isn't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output? Why do I have to slave over a document like this? Adobe, stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results.Also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this? Mine shows me a heavily pixelated, entirely xparent BW image when it supposed to be a cropped color image. What do you want me to do with that
The title of this product is a joke.  It should be called "Not Easy CD burning".  Roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is.  It is way too complicated for burning simple CDs
First of all, this software performs like someones term project.  Why havent these guys been sued yet?Pros:  Nice retail packagingCons:  Not testedDoesnt burn all your filesNO supportOverall a waste of moner
I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive  (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times.  No response.  I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software. I have a new Gateway desktop that came with the above drive.
I found this program simple, easy to operate. However, when creating a DVD project I used a narration for my audio.  The narration matched each picture perfectly, when I decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off.  Do NOT count on any tech support.  They offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all.  You have the option of forking over $35 PER INCIDENT in order to get a real live person on the phone- but it still does not guarantee it will help.  And now, I'm not even able to burn it!!!! I hate this program
I used Easy Creator 4 for years. Bought new computers so bought Easy Creator 6. It will not work on 2 E-Machines with XP. It wipes out CD rom drive so that it is unusable. I requested tech support 6/12/06. It's 7/15/06 and I am still waiting. I uninstalled it. I found Easy Creator 5 platinum on Amazon and ordered it. It works
This Roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever.  First, it doesn't work.  Second, I cannot obtain any support from Roxio to find out why.  They won't give support until you register, the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software, and it takes you to a website that either doesn't exist, or is always down.  Thus, it turns out to be a complete waste of money, not to mention several hours of time.  RUN, don't WALK away from this software and this company
this product does nothing.  i put in 30 dvds and vcds and none were able to be copied.  easy dvd burner if u can actually find a dvd that is able to burn.  everything is copy protected...and i hear that over and over again.  there is a reason why this product is so cheap...BECAUSE IT DOES NOTHING AT ALL!  u CANT burn dvds.  you can only take a few files you might already have and burn them on a disk that does not play on a dvd player.  thats it.  dont waste you money on this.  its worthless..
Loaded it on my laptop. It says that a compatible device was not found.Went to website, downloaded patch. It said I had the latest patch already.Everywhere you go on the roxio website, it tells you you can upgrade to version 8 for $20 off. It still is more than $50 and if Version 6 doesn't work, why would I throw more money at the problem?I could find no usefull information on the website and no way to speak to someone.I took it back to Best Buy. They said they could only exchange it for the same piece of junk. I went next door to Staples and they said if I bought software that does not work from them, they would refund my money if I bought it back within 14 days. So, I found a new source for software.Pros: It did not crash my laptopIt did not cause the modem to dial international callsCons:Doesn't workno tech supportdoesn't workno tech suppor
I am very disappointed with this product.  Using the features of it are very difficult (red eye, sizing, etc.) in addition, digital photos downloaded into Photo Album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen. I expected more from it but have found I have less.  I will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features
I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!!I even e-mailed Corel about this. Its been 4 days, I have NOT had a response.DO NOT BUY!!! I RATE THIS PRODUCE AS A -2 STARS
It's to bad I can't give negative stars as this package certainly deserves them. This program is total garbage. A gargantuan waste of both time and money. Seemingly with every menu change, it recatalogues your entire photo collection, on ALL DRIVES, which takes HOURS (like 12+) to accomplish. And, while it will scan and catalogue all of the drives on your computer, don't even think about selecting a folder and expecting it to display the contents of that folder and all of it's subfolders. Ain't a gonna happen... but is will happily go through and catalogue them again for you, but, of course, after waiting hours for the software to finish catalogueing, it doesn't display the contents.  No, that would be way to logical.After realizing that my computer had slowed to a crawl, I checked the memory usage and found that the Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe was using 6 to 7 times higher than any other program running, and that includes Norton Internet Security, a notorious memory hog! Guess we now know what the DELUXE part is!As far as I am concerned, Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe is neither intuitive nor is it the "Best of" anything. It is a creeping, bloated dinosaur and a total waste of your hard earned money.
I do not like software. It always hang no matter what I did. Maybe this is becasue it has not finished the index process? I had many many photos  in my computer.
I am extremelly disappointed with Roxio, the makers of CD Creators; especailly Easy CD Creator 5.   I purchased Easy CD Creator 5, sometime back from an affiliate of Amazon.com.  It was dispatched promptly and in very good condition.  I installed it on my computer running Windows 98.   After some initial problmes it was running fine.    A few days back I installed Windows XP professional on my computer, and I got a message that the CD Creator was not compatible with this version of Windows.  It hinted to contact Roxio.  I tried contact Roxio with the help of the link, but found it impossible to send them my message.   They have an automated "Roxann" that is so difficult to understand.  Next they invite you to a "Webticket" and you are supposed to mention your problem on it.   But when you submit your query or complain, nothing happens.  The site just stares at you dumbly!! There is no way to obtain Roxio's mailing address either.  So now I am stuck with this "Easy CD Creator 5" with no help from Roxio?
The first version of Easy CD Creator I used was CD Creator 4 basic. It was okay, pretty much what it said it was: basic. I got the upgrade to that from an Ebay auction and it worked pretty good. Later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new CDRW drives in good old version 4, I upgraded to CD Creator 5 Platinum (The version being sold here.) This too worked pretty good - for a little while. Then the operation was moved over from Adaptec to Roxio, and from that point onward, things have been more thorny than rosy.Roxio will REQUIRE you to register the product in order to download the (ONE) utterly essential update to keep this thing running. Perhaps you don't mind that, but I feel it's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy. Plus you have to keep track  of your password to the website and if you change ISP's you will have to RE-REGISTER. A hassle to say the least. Also , since Roxio took the reins, there are no further updates being provided. Instead Roxio tries to "encourage" (read "browbeat") you into getting the software upgrade for even more money. This upgrade will NOT work on Win98SE, which I still use for various reasons. So IF I were to upgrade the software AGAIN, I would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that I need and still use. If you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making, I applaud you. I prefer to keep a little cash for retirement.     It is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form, and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face, such as getting "Illegal Request" errors from Direct CD, or inability to format or erase CDRW's that was once possible in version 4. Also, any CDRW's created in version 4 MAY NOT be readable with the new software, or at the least there are some technical issues with this. At any rate, it is not neccessarily all that "EASY" unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand (or are willing to learn) some of the finer technical points in CD recording technology. I prefer not to be bothered with it, I just want to create some CDs.    I now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all, especially Direct CD, a program that originally provided the ability to do "drag and drop" writing of files to a Read/Write CD. Now I find that Direct CD is non-functional, and the only CD's I can write are CDR's, and there are problems growing in that area as well. Speed of the CDRW or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue. The software simply refuses to work as it once did.It shouldn't be called "EASY CD Creator". Perhaps "IRRITATING" CD Creator would be more appropriate. In Summary: This does not deserve stars. Perhaps a few "BLACK HOLES"? While I once would have given wholehearted supported this product, regrettably I cannot support it with the same enthusiasm now.  
I spent the last 3 hours trying to get support for this product. Although the site did not reject me it sent me through loops to get an "update" that when run, errored out as soon as it began
This program is average to below average in it's abilities.That said, just hope you don't need any Roxio tech support.Why? because Roxio's  support bites!You CANNOT contact anyone online or by email for help;whenever their dis-functional "web portal" [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop. I needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is NOT ALLOWED on the internet.It used to be you could download Roxio's PATCHES from any pc having internet access. Then burn patch[s] to a CD, or copy to floppy/jumpdrive.Then "sneakernet" the patches to the pc needing them.NO MORE.What happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on MY pc.[EZCD5 doesn't exist on my pc].Instead of simply letting me download it somewhere, like to my hard drive, vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc,[which won't work in my case as I'm not using roxio, nor have it installed on my pc]; apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process STOP/END and proceed to send the customer back to Roxio's initial patch download page.When you need a patch, all these endless loops and support gamesare enough to get me looking for a different product/different company.If you want to minimize human contact with customers, fine.But let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going.Don't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a WEB SERVER. That ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls.Then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem.IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.If a company won't provide access to PATCHES, even after I have logged into their website with username and password, [so they know is accessing their patches] AND they  don't offer any type of FTP site  as a download backup  option, then I sure as heck won't be buying anymore of their products.I see why Roxio bought up CeQuadrat and other companies.[Though I hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that]. When a competitor has a better product, why fight to improve your prodsuct's quality/features, when you can buy the other company out. Thank goodness Nero is not under the Roxio umbrella.
Despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of Windows XP, my XP machine refused to load Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless.Probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to XP you could keep it running with patches and updates.  So take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt.  If you cannot install the primary program, the update disc is of no use.The program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine.
Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. (For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)
If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support
Yeah, I know it's the industry standard, and it's powerful, and all that stuff.  But, MY GOD, what a freaking PAIN to use.  It's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch.  While the interface in CS2 is an improvement, doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should.  Frankly, I could draw better stuff faster with 1990's-era Macintosh drawing programs.  The drawing issues are compounded by the fact that -- in true Adobe spirit -- this program is incredibly bloated and slow.  It's slow doing EVERYTHING... I've never seen a program so slow starting up.  And every time you save a file (even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes) you get a "saving file" progress bar for a few seconds.  It's also incredibly slow to shut down... frequently taking about 30 seconds.  I'm running it on a Pentium M laptop, and I know this is not a "graphics professional" machine, but COME ON!  Let's get the lead out!  I just get the sense that Adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed.  That bugs me a lot
Microsoft Office can be handy to have.  The files you can open, edit and create with it (most notably .doc, .xls, and .ppt) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options. It's (relatively) intuitive.  It has a pretty broad array of useful functions.It's also obscenely expensive, considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc, .xls, and .ppt; intuitive interface; and functionality -- for free.I hunted up OpenOffice two years ago when I decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers, make basic presentations, or put together spreadsheets.  I was looking for basic functionality, but I was pleasantly surprised; OpenOffice does most of the neat tricks, too.  (Actually, it has a neat trick Microsoft can never replicate: it's open source, so it can respond to the needs of individual users.  You just say "Add this neat trick!"  and someone will likely be able to do it for you.)It is possible that Microsoft Office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that OpenOffice doesn't.  But considering the price differential, I wouldn't splurge on this before checking.
Office 97 was a pretty good product. The programs were powerful, had a decent interface (maybe not as good as the Claris products of the early 1990s, but not bad), and came with a ton of features all on one disc. The Office 98 release for Mac was pretty much the same thing. The only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant (paperclip) but it is easy enough to turn off.Office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me. I felt that the improvements were minimal (aside from a bit more stability in Word--anyone who has ever used Word 97 on a regular basis knows it's prone to crashing) and in fact detracted from the ease of use. One example is the clip gallery, which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that wouldn't have received decent reviews in 1988. Another is PowerPoint's outline feature. I always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller. When you use smaller displays like I often do this is a problem. The menus, which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them, were also an annoyance. The manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size.Office 2003 continues making the program uglier. Now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen. Again, this eats into the workspace. The clip art system is even more cumbersome, and many of the clips are online only now. The help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well. Now some people may not complain, but what if you're using a laptop in the middle of the country?I feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. In fact, the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful. On my Macs, I've switched to Keynote for presentations and Pages for some of my word processing because the new Office versions on that platform are similar.Some of the templates also look very 1997. Apple's programs are updated on a regular basis, and their templates look very modern. Now I know Microsoft adds some new ones now and then, but they should consider redesigning many of them--such as replacing the overused Arial and Times New Roman fonts with something a little more classy.The program is bloated way too heavily. I can run Office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1GB hard drive, but can't even get 2003 on it.A final gripe is that Access is not user friendly at all. File Maker is a better alternative, as it is easier to use and friendlier
Ok! Being the richest human being on the planet called earth, Bill Gates decided that he's not wealthy enough. So he released this Microsoft office 2003, which I really think is not much different from previous edition. The price is, as usual, very expensive. What's worse is that Bill Gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version. So mere mortals like us need to spend extra BIG money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents.I can see Bill Gates, being a deified bloodsucker, using $100 dollar bills as toilet paper, and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live. SO SHAME ON YOU BILL GATES AND MICROSOFT
Microsoft is simply sloppy with their programming!"Open Office" is a better program, is open-source (meaning if you don't want some paperclip's help, you simply don't download that part of it) AND OPEN OFFICE is FREE! It is also compatible with most of the functions that MS Office uses (and is upgraded with new features faster than MS's product, which is a rip-off!)MS's Office 97 was the best of the Office suites, even though it did have it's problems, Spending the money to supposedly "upgrade" to this (or any other Microsoft product for that matter) is simply burning your money!) OPen-source software is FREE, it's perfectly legal, it is open t anyone decompiling it, so if you want to make your own custom goodies, you can, but then there are so many written by so many people willing to share, you don't have to develop your own, as there are already *SO* many freebie ones (and some low-cost additions by some places, but most are free) that if you want whistles and bells, or even a Christmas theme in February, you can get it for OPEN OFFICE! (Not so with this or ANY Microsoft product for that matter)Simply sloppy programming - nothing more, AND you can get a fully functioning and compatable office suite for free legally
While Microsoft tries very hard to make Office "think ahead of me," they almost always seem to get it wrong.  The result is a package that consistently annoys me.  It is true that one can turn off the "helpful" hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering, however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody's business.  In my opinion, Office '97 was an excellent package, and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill.  As with many people, I use Office at work because I have no choice.  At home I've had good luck with StarOffice from Sun.  While not perfect, StarOffice has read and created files compatible with Microsoft Office very consistently in my experience, and it's a whole lot less expensive.  I am therefore hesitant to recommend Microsoft Office Professional Edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of Excel and/or need to use Access database frequently.    
I bought this upgrade because I thought it would let me share my contacts. It says so on the box, but it doesn't. It works just like the old contacts which you can't share with others except if you export it. No live sharing. Why couldn't they make it so I could put the file on my server? Or on a secure site? Then all my office can work off one contact list.50% or more of the time the business contacts can't be found when you search for a contact. It's like the business contacts is an add in that doesn't work with Outlook. Or you add contacts, save it, email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone. Also, lots of times when you try to SEND, the email won't SEND, it stays in the outbox. And repeatedly you open and hit the SEND button but it won't change to SEND status. Now, if you leave it in the outbox, sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email. Or sometimes you can FORWARD and SEND.. Geez, what a waste of money this upgrade was. We won't be using it on any of our other computers and we haven't bought if on the new computers we have ordered.
Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there. I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware. Star Office 8 is under $50 from Amazon and is fully compatible with Microsoft Office, and includes full functionalities of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Visio, and Access. Let me know what MS software I can buy under $100, let alone $50. Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the Microsoft Monopoly, and the dawning of the Era of Sanity in computer software.
In the last year I have tried this program, PC-Cillin  four sharewares from CNET, and f-ZA the only one that doesn't cause more problems than it solves. The others prevent me from doing wireless printing, slowdown the computer  generate false alarms
i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security.  Now i regret buying one.  Since ive installed it, IT SLOWED MY COMPUTER, ITS VERY VERY HARD TO CLOSE WINDOW AND WORSE WHEN I DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET I HAVE A HARD TIME LOGGING OFF.  everytime im on the internet,i get mad and upset. its not worth all the stress. i definitely dont recommend this product. now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to NOrton
Everything has been said about this product. When it's working, you're happy. With my 8 version, almost everything was fine. With the 10 version, it's a bloody nightmare. I'm giving up, throwing my Dazzle DVC150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my VHS to DVD. NEVER Pinnacle again
I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., 10.0, and this one.  And they've all had two things in common:1.  When the program works, it's superb.2.  The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out.  Studio Plus v10.5 is no exception.Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price.  At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.My advice?  Shop around.  Google the competition.  But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle
Crashes on every thing I try to do. I've never seen such a poor excuse for a program. I paid 70 dollars for it and am now throwing it in the TRASH.
I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free.There are several good products now so Pinnacle isn't your only choice.  I changed to Sony Vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve.  For super simple try Ulead or one of the others.
Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in ... Hold on ... let me start again.Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting ... Dang it! Give me a few minutes here ... Pinnacle Studio can assist ... (Samuel L Jackson-styled expletive) ... how many times is this gonna happen? Start and stop! Start and stop! Enough already!One more time. Now, what was I saying? Oh, yeah ... Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running.Got the idea?Just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the Pinnacle products. This is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions. After installing the program, installing the patches, uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches, I am still experiencing too many crashes.If you intend to use this program to piece together a video of Uncle Morty's birthday party, the family vacation or your neighbor's kid's bar mitzvah, the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness. If, however, your video projects fit under the category of "job description," then I suggest spending the money for Adobe Premiere
Let me sum up this software "total junk"Pinnacle will give you one free support phone call for help, then $25 for the next call.They give you free email support, but answer everything but your problem.   They try and blame it on Windows XP, and will have you reload Windows.I owned Studio 8, and it worked fine.   Went to Studio 9, and had a few problems.   Upgraded to Studio 9 Plus, and after a week of trying to make it render my projects with no sucess, and crash after crash, I removed it from my machine.They sent me an offer of their all new 10.5 plus upgrade, Hollywood FX, 3 of their Premium packs, and a hat that says Studio 10 on it.   This said that the program had been rebuilt from bottom up.    This program should be called "Crash after Crash", and the only thing that works is the hat.If you feel the urge to waste $100, and hours of your time, just buy this product.Look at the reviews on Studio 10, and the other Studio products, and most only have one star.   Out of over 100 reviews over 95% had one star.   I found one with 5 stars, but looking at the reviewers other reviews he is obviously an employee, or share holder in the company.   He wrote a 1 star review on a Sony competative product, and 5 star reviews for other Pinnacle products that you would not own if 10.5 worked
I've been a user of Pinnacle version 8 (which I loved), and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer DVDs.  What a disappointment this "upgrade" has been.  Crash after crash.  What is most disappointing is that Pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could "help" them develop a better product.  This means to me that they knowingly released bad code, and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a $100.  Guess what, I don't want to help Pinnacle build a better product.  I want a product that works when I purchase it.Lesson learned.  Next time I read a bad review on a product, I'm staying away
I was very disappointed with this program. But I was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases. Even so, the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating. I learned more Icelandic (along with correct pronounciations) while in Iceland than I did with this program. And besides, anyone under the age of 50 in Iceland speaks English
i was charged the full price of 49.95 with no $20 coupon inserted
I have owned eleven VCOM products and from now on, they don't have my business. The product touts itself in part as a vital tool when/if your machine crashes. If it does, be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program. You are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you can't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process. Sadly, customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you can't get through via phone...What you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products. Thanks, folks. Version 6.0 is also much slower than Version 5. Support for 5.0, by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out, despite the functionality of that program.   For the price, the software should work like a major player, rather than a dollar bin special. 
I would not buy it!  Hard to use. My machine runs slower since the install. 
An Internet search found complaints about not receiving rebates.  Why would they give you something for nothing?  I have had several rebate problems and most of them involved free items or insanely cheap items.  This "free" software could cost you $30 if the company decides they don't want to pay
Be advised, this Software is for a SINGLE USER, only licensed for one computer. I bought this for Home use after using SS% for 2 years and V-Com said it would no longer be supported of 03/06. I installed it on 2 home computers, it worked fine for 4 weeks, then it popped up a Box on my second computer that I couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer, I needed to buy additional license for each computer. When I tried to use it on my Main computer, it popped up the same message. So now it will not work on either computer. I uninstalled it and sent it back. Just because it's Cheap does not mean it's any good
I was using VCOM SystemSuite Pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction.  But, after I reconfigured my PC to "Standard PC", the software rejected my Serial Number, claiming I was using the software on another PC.  I only own ONE pc.  Technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc's.  Well, that is totally incorrect because, like I said, I only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house.  They have a Bug in their serial number checking process.  Anyway, they would not help me restore the software serial number because I could not furnish proof of purchase.  They think I am a crook. I'm not, I only want what I paid for to work
  After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something.   Also, I submitted the rebate form which came on the package, but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and I need to check w/ them. I did and they said they shipped what VCOM had provided them, which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade.  Not very impressed w/ either the software or the company. Would never buy another product from these guys, even when the price after rebate is 0. LOF
I agree with others who said it crashes the system. Overall, I found SS6 Pro had more problems than it was worth--even if it were free, it's not worth all the time and effort. Besides all the crashes, downloading the virus/spyware updates via dialup TAKES FOREVER! Each download runs 1 to 1 1/2 hours. BE FOREWARNED.In the end, I returned my copy to VCom, though to date I have not yet received a refund
I don't have a problem with the software.  It pretty much does what we need but reversing an error can be a nightmare.  Before I start this tirade, I should point out that the customer service reps were very nice.  But they don't have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service (please, read on).  The customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary.  (1) They want to have access to your checking account to pay for the annual payroll subscription!!  (2) They DO NOT SEND RECEIPTS!!  I help with the books for a small non-profit and paid for the payroll subscription on my own credit card.  The only receipt I could get was a copy of the invoice, which is not formatted to print correctly on an HP1200 (duh!!).  What is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts!  If you acquiesce to the checking account withdrawal, the only receipt you receive is the line item on your bank statement.  Have they every heard of a "paper trail".  Well you sure won't get one if you purchase the payroll subscription for this product.  I will start looking for an alternative to Intuit because they obviously don't understand some basic accounting and auditing principles.
This dictionary is not for the person who English is his second language. It does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word. In addtion, the micro doesn't work well with MS Word.
I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery!  When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also!  VERY BAD!  I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out
This is the worst thing I have ever bought. I bought it because I am having some trouble in spanish in school. I bought it thinking that if I gave a english word it would give you the spanish word or vise versa. But all it does is give you the definition and does not give you the english word.So save your self 20 dollars and don't buy thi
Although this dictionary's contents are extensive, the screen functions are relics from the DOS era.  They are laborious and clumsy.  To find a word for difinition, it has to be spelled perfectly, there's no list of proximations to the word entered.  Changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn't show up in the entry slot. If someone knows of a better software, I'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks!!  Maria McGowan 
The definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good. The user interface is quite honestly shameful. Software companies got away with this years ago, but there are now accepted standards for windows user interfaces (e.g keyboard short cuts are missing). Integration with Word 2003 is weak. Numerous bugs and exceptions and very slow
The description of this product on the Amazon site does not match what I received. Like another reviewer mentioned, the product was actually shipped from the UK so it took longer, and several features listed as being in the product are not there, specifically, exporting/saving of loops is not allowed, and there is no library of 1000+ loops included either. It seems to me to be basically like a demo version. Also, even though it was advertised as being new in the box, all I got was what looks like a (used) CD with no manual or CD key - so much for upgrading later! I am returning it. The SKU should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out
I received this item today and was surprised1) It was shipped from overseas (UK)2) It came with only one CD instead of two like a previous reviewer thought3) No paperwork - it came in a clear case with no artwork, info, etc4) Sonic Foundry sold ACID to Sony in 2003 (according to Sonic Foundry's website) and SF no longer provides support5) I can't get this to register online, which seems a little dodgy, but other than that, it seems functional. No huge library of loops, either. Can't really say I got what I expected
In installed this product on a Dell Optiplex GX110 (admittedly not the latest, but still a very standard machine) running Windows 2000 with 512MB of memory. In spite of spending literally hours with the software I was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse, as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video. Without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls. Multiple emails to Broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that I refer to their Website for help. This site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems (like not being able to read the install CD).It would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver. Be prepared for possible frustrations with this product, with little support from the manufacturer. I cannot report on other features of the software because I was never able to produce even the walls of a structure
I've used CAD programs written in the 80's that are better than this.   I'll go back to Drawing Board 1.0 over this thing.  Not user friendly.   I can hardly draw a few walls without it crashing.  JUN
3D Home Architect is a complete crock. I have attempted to use it many times. After hours of reading and playing with it I am still unable to perform the most simple task. I own V1.3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years. I also spent lots of time trading emails with Broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and I got nothing. So henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned $. Sorry
I trusted that this software would do what it claimed to do and was so let down by its lack of performance that I am dumbfounded and left speechless.  During backup process I selected about 15GB of info to backup, spanning 4 DVDs.  Everything looked fine, except for TWO (2) simple errors that I received, indicating that those related files may not have been copied/backed up properly.  I figured no big deal, 2 files/errors out 15GB, I could handle that.  Based upon the false pretenses that my critical info was backed up properly (simple pictures, videos, mp3 files and Financial Files to include previous years tax files), I then proceeded to slick my drive.  Remember, only 2 simple, benign and almost inconspicuous errors during the backup process.  Everything looked great.During the restore process, I then received numerous errors, each of them requiring me to click 'Yes' when asked if I wanted to proceed.  I got tired of clicking Yes around the 100 or so mark and decided to click no.  When you click 'no', EVERYTHING is undone; there is no 'ignore all' function so I had to sit through every prompt and got tired of it and decided that proceeding with 1000 files and answering yes would involve too much pain for me.  I then selected a smaller group of files to have restored, only the 'My Documents' folder but ran into the same situation.  Eventually I ran a test on a small folder to have restored and still ran into the errors but pressed through.  Hardly any of the files were received error free and those that had issues were never restored.  My guess is approximately 2/3 or 3/4 of my files were not restored and of course none that really mattered made it.I had the latest update applied to the program, so that should not be the cause.  I would have done better to slick my entire hard drive without going through the backup process as I would have been at nearly the same place but without experiencing all the headaches, frustrations and an investment of hours, no DAYS of my time.The program has been recently purchased by Microsoft for inclusion in the Vista OS, I imagine.  It will do well as a Microsoft product, as it fails to deliver upon its promises
All I wanted was a way to identify some files, remember which ones so every time I wanted to backup, I would press "go" and the backup would start. AlohaBob was too "smart" for my use. First, it has this intelligent file finder that finds what is likely to be backed up.  I indicate that I want to select my own files (which it lets me think I can do). Then thinking it would bring me to browser window -- no, no, no...it still needs to waste time doing its indexing as if I had selected the "smart find". I then manually select my files (great!!). In trying to save the "template" of what files I wanted to backup, it requires that I make it a reoccurring backup with selected backup frequency (YUK!!). I want to back up when I get to it (about once a month, not when it wants to -- I am backing up to a DVD which I need to put in the drive).  OK, so now I am over that and the backup begins - GREAT!!!  Upon returning into the application a month later, I can not select my saved "template" to "run now", it will run when it is scheduled to run :(  So...I need to repeat the whole process just to get the same files as last time backed up.  I exchanged emails with the company and they understood but were not going to "add" the features I described.  Oh well - it looked like such a promising product.  Now I need to find another that satisfies my requirements
I really dislike this software.  I'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way.  First, when you initially select files and folders, your disk choices are "C:" or "ALL".  I have several disks and I want to pick and choose, but this program makes that really difficult.  Then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up.  Choose carefully, because you won't be allowed to change it later!  And if you want to do incremental backups, be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save, because you can't do it later.  Basically the entire job, future backups and all, must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over. 
Talk about junk! No search capability, mislabeled cds, some cds won't run - in short, YUK!
800,000 images without keywords - the only useful parts of this collection are the classic and traditional .tif's that you can take into illustrator and turn into vector.  The high res images aren't, the clipart is less than microsoft office online quality and I've gotten far more use out of a 50,000 image collection b/c they took the time to keyword and catagorize the collection.If you like to look thru a book and put in one of the 32 disks and then find the image - then this collection is for you.  If you want to have any sort of search capabilites, look elsewhere
I'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product.  There is no 800 number for tech-support, so it's a long distance call.  I have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person.  They offer only email support, but don't write back.  If you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you, but it never happens
This game was a little too hard for my tastes. Despite the fact that I played at the junior level I managed to get killed shortly after starting out. I also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once I left the room I couldn't find my way back (all the corridors look alike). So far I've fallen down an elevator shaft, gotten caught breaking and entering, been crushed by an elevator, frozen to death and been hit over the head...I've got to ask is this really appropriate for children
This software didn't quite do what I expected.  I was somewhat disappointed when I discovered that it wouldn't convert iTunes m4p music files to MP3 files to run on a REAL Player. 
Did not work with my apple computer,requested help but did not get results I wanted which was to return idem  get credi
The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review
This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this.  It adds virtually nothing to XP.  Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition.  That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product.  The themes are nice but far too few for the price.  The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things.  The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.  Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff.  Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money
I purchased this software thinking that I could take my digital images, create a slide show with music, and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch.Unfortunately, the disk that I got gave me some error messages that when I called tech support (one hour hold time)they told me that my error message meant that I could create files, but they'll only run on my computer, not on my tv dvd player. In addition, you need to buy additional dvd burning software, because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the Microsoft logo on them. (The package says the dvds will run on almost any dvd player)So I asked for my money back. However, since it took me more than 30 days to find all of this out, they refused a refund.
By reading the cover I thought it would be a great product to have. It indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without. Games - Bowling game is actually a teaser version. You can play only two lanes. Others cost you extra. Two other games are not exciting.Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre.I liked the analog convertor but not too much. If you can get input from any audio device, this program can convert it into a digital format. Alas it doesn't convert to MP3 format. Also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast, but not on the normal speed.Dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions. I liked Ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing.Bottom line - I don't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week.
This dude is selling info that you can learn from ANYONE with VERY LIMITED computer knowledge.  All of the same info is on the net for free.This product exists for one purpose... to steal from you.This pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission.  He could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product... but scams seem to be his thing.  AVOID!!  This is the WORST company that I have ever delt with in my ENTIRE life.  This John guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed.  He is an embarrasement to his company and his family.  At least a mugger steals from me face to face... this snake is sneaky about it
Imagine that you know so little about a computer that you wouldn't even be here reading this review.These discs are for your grandmother who still has the corded, dial, yellow wall phone. If you are a recent (one hour ago) immigrant from a sixth world country, and you need to forward the "Burger King Christmas Song", well, then you're already ahead of these "learning" CDs. (My apologies to grandmothers with corded, dial, yellow wall phones). (Actually, I kinda wish I had one!) Regards, Older But No Smarter
Warning! I resized my partition and when it restarted my computed could not boot. It destroyed my system and I had to format my whole drive.Read all the reviews from this program carefully. I read them but did not believe them
I have to qualify this review by saying that I do not own PM 8.0, so I cannot fairly give a rating, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews. I can only relate personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I do own and have used PM 6.0 since '01 when it was still Powerquest instead of Norton/Symantec and it has worked very well, though the GUI is a bit quirky. I have run it with 2 drives, one with 98SE and XP Pro, with PM loaded on 98SE partition and it did everything I needed on both drives. Trouble is, version 5.0 is, AFAIK, not compatible with XP and since M$ no longer supports 98SE, we have a problem, Houston. Currently I am  using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed. If I get a drive partitioning software product compatible with XP, it most assuredly WILL NOT BE ANYTHING PRODUCED BY NORTON/SYMANTEC, based on these reviews and personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I first bought a computer in '98 and used Norton Antivirus 5.0. At that time, Norton was probably the best antivirus product out there. It worked flawlessly and I used and recommended it for years. NO MORE. I purchased a copy of Symantec System Works 2005 right after it was released. Long story short, I no longer use Norton products because I got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become, and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores. There is one lone Symantec product I still use---Windoctor, which is not installed on my 'puter but ran from the CD as needed.  Adios, anything else produced by Norton/Symantec. It ain't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin.
I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.       I am sorry that I did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by Symantec for other products that I have purchased from them.   All I wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my C: drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive.    I was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with Symantec Technical Support.   I was only able to speak to technical support staff in India who finally told me that they could not solve my problem, but that I would be called back by a senior engineer.  It never happened despite repeated promises.  I finally gave up and returned the product to Symantec for a refund.
I am an experienced computer user, and I bought this primarily on my previous experince with Symantec products, which had been good.  My experience with this product was unfortunately, very poor.First - the product claims to be able to clone your boot partition, but this failed repeatedly, creating cloned partitions which were not bootable.  Second - Tech support failed to provide an answer for days while I eventually figured out myself that I needed to use the bootable media to make a clone of my system disk - something the windows application was happy to try and fail at without warning.  Even when I attempted to provide this information to tech support so they could answer similar questions for others, they didn't get what I was saying and sent me another form letter response detailing how to make a copy (instructions which failed of course).Third - On another occasion, even using the bootable media, I got the error "1517" when attempting to clone by boot partition.  Searching the web revealed others having this problem, and Symantec tech support full of bogus solutions for it.Fourth - no support for USB/Firewire drives with the bootable media.On the plus side - it did resize partitions I asked it to without trouble (I give it one extra star for something working)
I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.  I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling.  If I were a small business, I would be out of business.  All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable
Attempted to upgrade from 97 to 2003... bad move... none of my access 97 programs work now... in fact I, I brought home a 2003 access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions... nope... the upgrade just didn't work.....had to purchase a full version to set things right... save your money on this product..
Why are the newer products getting slower by the version. I still love Version 5. It does not forever to open up in a Web browser..Update: I have been using Version 7 now for several months.. I am glad to say that I am now a lot happier. Granted it still uses a lot of memory. However, the new features that it has compared to Version 5, makes the upgrade worthwhile. However, watch out.. there are several features that Adobe took out from the Standard version and only has on the PRO version..
Being familiar with some Adobe products, we opted to try this at work as a cheaper alternative than some other packages for simple web graphics work.  Boy, were we disappointed.Simply put, this tool is not so much a tool, but a hindrance.  Utilities such as transparencies, are not only difficult to make work properly, but hidden in non-intuititve locations.  Dialogs are non-standard, which requires getting used to strange layouts in design.  While seeminly small for just a couple items I've mentioned, multiply this by the supposed feature set of the product and you start to get an idea of how cumbersome the tool really is.As has been mentioned by plenty of other people, it is also slow.  If you want a simple image viewer, find anything else - even freeware, as I have never come across an image utility that takes so long to load, regardless of it is the first time or the umpteenth time.While I could go on about the unsatisfactory qualities of this product, I will simple reiterate what others had also said; it is cumbersome to use, slow to use and load, un-intuitive with poor layout and design, and lacks many basic features one would expect in this form of utility.
I am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0.  Performance is very poor, especially the organizer.  It's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are, such as Mac iPhoto and even the Canon software that came with my camera, compared to Elements.  Recently, I've been getting lots of crashes, though everything else on my system is completely stable.  The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality, when it works correctly
I bought this software primarily so I could create slideshows with music and other special effects. Since I got it, I have had nothing but problems. First of all, it would not install completely on my computer. The techs at Adobe could not figure out the problem. After I reformatted my hard drive, I finally got Photoshop to install properly. Then another problem. When I burned my slideshow photos to a VCD, they came out just awful (unlike Adobe's demo video showing a perfectly created  slideshow.) Boy, was I deceived! I cannot say that this software is all bad. It does a nice job in correcting exposure errors in digital photos. However, if you want to create neat slideshows, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is not worth the cost
JUNK! I am a professional photographer and have used 2.0 for years for quick fixes and easy additions, thinking they might have made some improvements to make life easier... I was wrong. This program is a step back. I was a refund! I don't know who is writing they like this new version, but buyer beware! Laur
Crashed the system every time I tried to use it...   gave me such a headache I tossed it in the trash...
I just purchased the Hallmark Card Studio 2004 (...).  Everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card, the first side printed fine, but when printing the next side I keep getting the "this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down".  I have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far.  I have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed.  I am running windows 98SE.  I will probably be returning this to the store (if possible).  It looked to have some nice cards on it, which is basically all I wanted it for, but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer. 
The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims 4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions. That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly cards for all occasions means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own
I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception.  Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves.  I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least.  I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer.  I have been more than patient with this software.  It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs.  And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue.  As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE. 
I have a Compaq Presario laptop with Windows ME. I wanted to upgrade it, so I decided to buy the Windows XP Upgrade. I have another computer that came with XP built in, and I like that system a lot.Well, before I purchased this software, I specifically asked the manager at CompUSA if there are any problems upgrading from Windows ME to Windows XP. I was very specific. "No problem!" he told me, "It works great!"NONSENSE!Here is a list of hardware problems I had after loading Windows XP onto the laptop:1. My touch pad stopped working.2. My PCI bus started getting errors.3. My wireless network card (D-Link GW-630) stopped working.And these are just the things I noticed in the first day of using it!I spent over six hours on the telephone with various technical service reps at Microsoft, uninstalling and re-installing the software, being put on hold, reinstalling drivers, restarting the computer over and over and over and over again... Six extremely frustrating hours!Finally, the tech support people told me to uninstall the software. They said I should return the software to CompUSA.Now for the fun part. CompUSA refused to take it back!!! After arguing with the very same manager who told me everything should work great, all I got was an offer to do an exchange for the same product. Then the manager said my system must not be compatible. Well, I showed him the "System Requirements" on the box, where it says "Windows ME."  According to the box, my laptop is perfectly compatible!  But apparently it's not.Then the manager told me that he would not recommend upgrading from ME to XP. Well, intyeresting he says that now!  I reminded him about our conversation!!!I even gave the manager my Microsoft Case Number so he could see for himself the problems I had and all the tech support people who tried to fix it for me.In the end, I am stuck with software that does not work.Learn from my trials. Do not buy this software if you have Windows ME. Only buy it if you can get a written agreement from your seller that they will take the software back after it messes up your system
Don't take my word for it that's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on Slashdot. Be warned: Adobe has not learned its lesson, and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6, this latest release of Acrobat continues Adobe's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment, again, as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done--in fact, it's now nearly impossible. Like earlier releases, this version of Acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop "right click" menus. Adobe argues that these are conveniences, but they are entirely unnecessary (for most of us "printing" to Adobe PDF achieves the same result, is much more convenient, and a more natural model), and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface (for those who don't have the knowledge or patience to customize it) or a carefully tuned one (for those who do). Unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior (e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog), Acrobat's "option" for disabling this behavior, once deeply hidden in the setup process,is now almost completely absent. To disable the "Convert to Adobe PDF" button that mysteriously appears in the Outlook mail editor, for example, one has to be sure to choose "this feature will not be available" from the "Microsoft Outlook" option under "Acrobat PDFMaker" under "Create Adobe PDF". Simply deleting the button using Outlook's toolbar customization feature will not work: it comes right back when the editor is next opened. Similar problems arise in Word, Excel, Visio, Project, and Internet Explorer. And there's simply no way to get rid of the never-used "Convert to Adobe PDF" and "Combine in Acrobat..." entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files (even if one installs none of the Acrobat PDFMaker features). For the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that Acrobat 7 does, there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web, but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7: ("Adobe has really pushed the boat out with Acrobat 7 and managed to screw Word royally") . In short, Acrobat will make a mess of your working environment, there's no way to completely fix it, and even the partial fix is a pain (and not well documented). (This may seem a minor issue, but if every application followed Adobe's reckless example, our working environments would start to look like strip malls, crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it. One of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs; no application should interfere with that.) Experienced Acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for Acrobat (and most other Adobe applications): it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version. In fact, on my 2 GHz Pentium 4, it takes longer to launch than the entire Visual Studio .NET development environment, and longer than the boot sequence for Windows XP! There are other minor problems as well (arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items, etc.) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough. Unless you really need the latest Acrobat features, you should probably avoid this upgrade. And if the "improvements" in this release are any indication of where Adobe plans to go with future releases, it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management. Fortunately, there's no reason at all to upgrade. Version 7 offers no usefully new features, so you can (and should) avoid this one (at all costs)
If you use Microsoft Office (Word, Excel) don't buy it!  Links to your previous .pdf simply don't work.  Adobe knows about it, but have no viable work around.  Stick with prevous versions. 
Obviously bogus reviews.  Version 6 was slow as a dog, so any improvement will make this more interesting.  Of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting.  What about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5?  how bout tossing us all a bone
In an effort to boost their file numbers and appear to be more comprehensive, the creators included many VERY low resolution images that they "artsied" or "roughed" up with a dirty polaroid-transfer effect, or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides, which they must have hoped would excuse the poor quality of the original image.  For example, if you do a search for "tiger", you will get 165 results, but only 86 will be of the animal, (and not one of 20 images of 10 toy tigers, or 5 images of one tiger-striped chair-cushion and so on), and of those 86, 80 have the crusty effect applied to them.  The other 6 tigers have been taken out of those same 80 images and clipped out of their background to give you a floating tiger on a clump of grass or a tiger head (but have, thankfully, not been "dirtied" up with the transfer effect).  Out of all, there is NOT ONE clean image of a tiger in its environment.Here is another example.  A search for "sunset" yields 247 results.  Of these, 163 have the crusty polaroid transfer effect applied, and 70 are the same images duplicated (much smaller) in a sloppy stack of 5 slides. There are TWO clean sunset images.These are typical results.  Numbers don't mean anything!  This product is stuffed with multiple images of toys, frankly not-so-attractive people from hard angles, and old low-resolution stock photos to achieve 150,000 files. Would it have killed them to include ONE clean, print-resolution image in each category? Perhaps we could have done without 50 of the fake slide images (talk about dated anyway!) in order to get a product worth having around
First of all, the many samples I viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles. There are far fewer images than the number touted. This is a scam in my opinion, but a situation I could live with.But The major issue is that most of the photo images I have searched for my actual use have very poor, actually totally unusable resolution. They have corrupted clarity, Poor pixel quality, are distorted, and unsuitable except for perhaps, a third grader's school project.It was a complete waste of money. It is headed for the first garage sale I hold, and I will offer it for 50 cents with a non-return policy.
This product is very nice when it works.  However, I'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me.  When I attempt to export the image - either by saving, draging or copying, Hemera places a transparency over the object, making the product worthless.  I gave it two stars because, for the two months it worked, it worked well, however, now, it won't work at all.  And as the other reviewer stated, support is nearly non-existant
This product offers much to chose from and I really liked the photos. However, I have yet to get this program to work right. I am able to view the photos but when I go into the the Export Wizard to save the photos, the photo has a transparency over the top of it, instead of in the background. I tried bypassing the Export Wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving. This also inserts the transparency over the photo. I called Hemera in Canada and they instructed me to call Encore USA in CA for support. Encore USA said they couldn't help me. Encore's technical support is "limited to crashes, error messages and lockups". I also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or FAQ's. There was VERY little about this software and no help to be found. I wasted my money on a product I can't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control.
I thought this would be a good product for my computer.  I didn't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download.  During the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove (uninstall/delete) all of your known antivirus, spyware, and firewalls from your computer prior to install.  This leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message.  I received an error message that prevented me from completing the download. I purchased the software on Aug 3 and called customer support, they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue.  They were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans.  Microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support, those that know the basics and those that know more. they asked me to set up a time span when I would like to receive a call from the "teir II" agents, I chose 6-9pm.  I received several calls over the next two weeks, all of them were outside of the specified time.  I missed several of them because I have a career and a life. When I finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue.  Here it was, two weeks after I purchased the software, I still did not have what I needed.  I was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software.  I called in several times druing the ordeal and the "teir I" agents just told me that I have to wait for the call, "they'll get to it when they get to it."  I was very upset with the customer support, I have no idea how the product is, but the customer support is just horrible.  Go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the "post your own thoughts" page through member accounts, you'll see that I'm not alone in this issue.  I have since purchased other software that cover what Microsoft says it will with onecare.  I did not have one problem with these installs.  Please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you cannot download due to a problem with your operating system (seperate from onecare).  This costs an additional $35 ontop of the cost for onecare
When I first installed the program I was able to access the images, but since that first time I haven't. My operating system is XP and I don't know if that is the problem with the software. I have since then uninstalled it. I did not think this product was very easy to use
Im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.  After picking up Illustrator however, Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers.  Ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people: those who "get" vector graphic programs, and those who errrr...dont. Unfortunately, after 10 hours use and much manual reading, I fall into the later category. I dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course. This decision was supported by friends proficient in its use - but who had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts to me. (Indeed, defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science!)So my advice is this: Be extremely carefull if youve never used Illustrator before. It may be a breeze to those well versed in its use, but to an absoloute beginner its an extremely difficult program to grasp and you may be dissapointed to find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars for it. 
This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9. Opens files that I've been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable 'saved' versions. Crashes. Can't save for mysterious reasons. Writes "version 10" files with text split into pieces.Such a fine product! Really glad I paid money for it!!I downgraded back to Irritator 10
I bought this product after reading the other on-line reviews saying how easy it was to use. I am someone who works with computers daily and this was anything but easy! It was hard to understand and getting someone from their help desk to assist was a joke! I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you're a professional architect/ computer genius
This program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details. I'm only using it for a simple garage and I expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions. Not so. You might as well pick up a copy of The Sims so you could at least have some fun with it. If you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it, forget it. Very disappointing waste of money
1. You can't print on anything over 8.5x14 paper.  Useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale.2. I bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3.0 of Broderbund 3D Home Architect.  It turns out that this is exactly the same software!I strongly recommend looking for something better
I was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool, but ended up disappointed.  They definately oversell it as an interior design tool.  Looking at the brochure online, I really think they must have touched up the images, because I don't see any way that they could have created them with this product.  As a matter of fact, the website Punch Interior Design software package implies that they did just that.The reason I don't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great.  I wish all software had that.  
As is typical with software claiming to be "topo", it is not. Expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for USGS quads this software is not as advertised.Since I own the other major competing program (for which you need to buy each state in order to get Quads (and for which I can not seem to find Wyoming)), I was eagerly awaiting this package.  In five minutes I realized Delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker/mountain biker (et al). You can order quads very simply using the package, but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at Delorme decided they would make the map blank (apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece).  So, you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it.  Well, if I knew that, I would already own the quad, and certainly wouldn't need to buy an electronic version.  For 2.50 more I could get it laminated.Yes, this is a flame, but it is deserved. Delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go (and then download, and pay for, the appropriate map).All in all, a complete waste of money--I only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers of such software get a clue and discover a more appropriate business model (versus selling blank maps, with a 100 dollar credit for maps that you don't even know will work)Cheers.
This computer system, although almost universally accepted, can be beaten in quality and flexibility by an operating system that can be downloaded for free, such as the fedora project (a distribution of linux, a OS which can be changed by anyone for free), or bought from software company supporting these open source project with unlimited customer support for around �50 ($90) or less
Windows XP, and basically any other windows based OS is junk. After using Windows 3.1, 95, 98SE, 2000, ME, and XP, I was getting very sick of the same old boring basic programs.Linux however, has tons of programs with a lot of extra features to it.Spellcheck is one. I have to buy Microsoft Word or some other office program for spell check, and how much?!?! I'll tell you one thing, it ain't free.Linux however, there is spell check, and not just in their word processor. I also found this in their messenger program, email, and even in web browsers, free!The other thing I hate about Windows is "You must activate your copy, and only one copy per computer".With linux, there is no activating, or "one per computer". You don't have to fear changing hardware and having to call in to reactivate, typing in a ton of numbers and answering questions. You can give someone a copy of linux, and they can try it, for free, and for life! It's not 30 days free, or free for only a few people, it's free for everyone for life!As for one who mentioned that Linux releases more fixes than Windows, that is true. The difference between Windows and Linux when it comes to releases is like this. When Microsoft finally gets the operating system done enough, they will release it.Linux will release free their OS/software right away. You can download it right away as it becomes available or simply wait until they fix the bugs.So in other words, let's say both OS's have the same software. Day 5 comes along, and this software pretty much works, but may have some bugs.Linux will release this, and you have the "option" of installing it and trying it out, or wait until more bugs are fixed.Windows will not release this until it is more offical and finished.This is why linux has a lot of patches, they give it to you when they first get it going, and as they continue to improve this, you can enjoy it right away and not have to wait so long.It is also true that Windows can be attacked by viruses within hours, where as linux can take several days/weeks/months.Also, Linux has been proven to give your hardware/computer a longer life span.It can also work better with older hardware so you don't have to be compelled to upgrade all the time.Why not try out linux? It's a lot cheaper, and you may be amazed by how great it really is. I prefer Mandriva 2006. It's a great system.Final note -Windows: Very costly, even more so to get the benefits/featuresLinux: FreeWindows: One per computer, or buy more licensesLinux: One copy to everyone for life, or each person can have a copy for lifeWindows: Boring; basic programsLinux: Several programs, multiple browsers, more than one type of software to fit your needs.Windows: New hardware/reformat PC: You must spend time on phone and answer questions and type in SEVERAL numbers to activate your PC.Linux: New hardware/reformat: Here's your OS installed; you're good to go!Windows: Constantly gets attacked by virusesLinux: Quite a lot saferWindows: Support? lol. Yeah, there may be someLinux: Various sites where you can ask questions for free and get help on your OSThat's just some of the reasons why I love linux
The Mac OS, $129 list, often cheaper, doesn't get viruses, worms, malware, etc and probably runs all the software you do on a PC, with the exception of some games. Go to a Mac Store and try it for yourself
Sorry to disappoint the believers, but this OS is way overpriced for what it does.  And, it will dominate you instead of the converse
This is Microsoft's most stable OS yet, but ridiculously over- priced.  I'll admit, I'm no fan of Microsoft, but I've very few problems with my desktop once I upgraded from Windows me
They sent me a product that wasn't legit and wouldn't take it back. Horrible service  I don't recommend anyone buy from this particular vendor! Just a horrible waste of time  MONEY
What a complete pain! ..... We now use Macs. However, I decided to take the California bar examination July 2006. The California bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by Examsoft. Presently, the software will only work on Windows XP. Moreover, the California bar examiners will not allow any Macs, even the newer Macs with the Intel processors which require complete re-booting into Windows.As a result, I was forced to upgrade my Gateway laptop, a fine laptop as far as PCs are concerned, in order to sit for this bar examination. (That, or purchase a new laptop, which was probably the point.) THANK GOD FOR GATEWAY COMPUTER TECHNICAL SUPPORT AS THE MICROSOFT FOLKS ARE CLUELESS:Even though the warranty on my Gateway laptop expired some time ago, Gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than I can possibly discuss here. Conversely, Microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected. .....I suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software (any new software) will only work with the newer versions of Windows XP or Vista, and since Vista will be such a memory hog, consumers eventually will be forced to dump their PCs which cannot be upgraded, for new PCs.As for how the operating system actually works: a grade of Fair. YESTERDAY, THE MICROSOFT UPDATE WEBSITE WAS DOWN WHICH, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT'S DISCUSSION WEBSITE SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM WITH OTHER WINDOW USERS AS WELL. Typical
I received the package and read the instructions.  In retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well.  It did not.  My installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless.  I had to take it to a professional to get it going.  Even so, I have had problems with Internet Explorer stopping suddenly, BSOD's.  This is not a job for the average computer user
It is now almost a month since I bought the upgrade to XP Prof. for my destop computer running W2K Prof. I have had nothing but trouble. My notebook computer, connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months, suddenly could not connect to the desktop. All network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing. I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood. Nonce could fix the problems and they are now "researching" the problem and supposed to call me this morning. During one of the calls, the tech. tried to blame it on my notebook. If any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company, you'll ercognize the situation. Right now, I would prefer getting a refund and returning to W2K
First of all, Microsoft needs to come down on their prices (Not that this will ever happen). I build computers for a living, and I'd say that 9 times out of 10 Windows is the single most expensive piece of any PC I build. That being said, XP has come a long way. Service pack 2 has done wonders for security. I also found it is the most stable version of Windows I've used to date. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. It still lets in it's share of "germs", stops responding from time to time (hangs), and it's very slow to shut down. The built-in CD writing software is TERRIBLE and Remote Desktop is not always a pleasure to use either. However, the biggest problem I've had so far is with product activation. As a PC technician, I'm always testing new parts. The most annoying problem I've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes (let's say you replace a video card, a hard drive and add some memory) all within a certain period of time (180 days maybe?) Windows makes you reactivate. This becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time. It makes you call Microsoft, where you have to convince the representitive that you're not trying to steal from them. Then you have to read them a long number (I think 41 digits) and then they'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in. It's driven me to the point of using Windows 2000 again to test my parts, even though this isn't always practical for testing XP compatibility. Overall, I feel that I paid too much for this operating system.
There are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w/ specific components of the Toshiba Satellite M45-S355. The hardware incompatibility issues w/ the DVD-RAM drive, the GL910 chipset, and the SoundMax integrated audio drivers are known to both Microsoft Technical Service personnel and their counterparts at Toshiba. I spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies (both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as "English"). The Amazon representative with whom I spoke was in New Delhi. I ultimately figured out (on my own) which Toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded (again consuming hours of download time with a 56K modem), and I used an Iomega CD-Rom USB external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours. I was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install Small Business Accounting 2006. Don't buy these products unless you absolutely MUST. Microsoft's "technical service" is a euphemism more aptly meaning "technically useless". There is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of Microsoft XP Professional. I should also mention that both the Toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from Amazon
I assumed, incorrectly, that Adobe's customer service would be professional and quick. I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone. When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!!  Adobe's call center is easily the worst customer service I have dealt with -- and I've dealt with some bad customer service
I use PDFs a lot and I must say that quite often I turn to Free PDF software to actually do the tasks that Acrobat fails to do. One area I have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes Acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so I switch to the Free PDF software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use.However if you are a pro PDF maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then I recommend this product hands down as the best one. I just find that it is not always the best PDF software package in the world, but a good one all the same.I would not recommend buying this one just to make standard PDF files alone. If you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right.
...for InDesign to not have one basic features. Everyone I know still does french folds, but in order to see double page spreads in InDesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program, then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page, layout by layout. This is mortally stupid. At this point Adobe should have figured how a tool like I.D. is actually used in conjunction with a printer, not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen. The oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool. Why isn't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output? Why do I have to slave over a document like this? Adobe, stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results.Also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this? Mine shows me a heavily pixelated, entirely xparent BW image when it supposed to be a cropped color image. What do you want me to do with that
The title of this product is a joke.  It should be called "Not Easy CD burning".  Roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is.  It is way too complicated for burning simple CDs
First of all, this software performs like someones term project.  Why havent these guys been sued yet?Pros:  Nice retail packagingCons:  Not testedDoesnt burn all your filesNO supportOverall a waste of moner
I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive  (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times.  No response.  I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software. I have a new Gateway desktop that came with the above drive.
I found this program simple, easy to operate. However, when creating a DVD project I used a narration for my audio.  The narration matched each picture perfectly, when I decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off.  Do NOT count on any tech support.  They offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all.  You have the option of forking over $35 PER INCIDENT in order to get a real live person on the phone- but it still does not guarantee it will help.  And now, I'm not even able to burn it!!!! I hate this program
I used Easy Creator 4 for years. Bought new computers so bought Easy Creator 6. It will not work on 2 E-Machines with XP. It wipes out CD rom drive so that it is unusable. I requested tech support 6/12/06. It's 7/15/06 and I am still waiting. I uninstalled it. I found Easy Creator 5 platinum on Amazon and ordered it. It works
This Roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever.  First, it doesn't work.  Second, I cannot obtain any support from Roxio to find out why.  They won't give support until you register, the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software, and it takes you to a website that either doesn't exist, or is always down.  Thus, it turns out to be a complete waste of money, not to mention several hours of time.  RUN, don't WALK away from this software and this company
this product does nothing.  i put in 30 dvds and vcds and none were able to be copied.  easy dvd burner if u can actually find a dvd that is able to burn.  everything is copy protected...and i hear that over and over again.  there is a reason why this product is so cheap...BECAUSE IT DOES NOTHING AT ALL!  u CANT burn dvds.  you can only take a few files you might already have and burn them on a disk that does not play on a dvd player.  thats it.  dont waste you money on this.  its worthless..
Loaded it on my laptop. It says that a compatible device was not found.Went to website, downloaded patch. It said I had the latest patch already.Everywhere you go on the roxio website, it tells you you can upgrade to version 8 for $20 off. It still is more than $50 and if Version 6 doesn't work, why would I throw more money at the problem?I could find no usefull information on the website and no way to speak to someone.I took it back to Best Buy. They said they could only exchange it for the same piece of junk. I went next door to Staples and they said if I bought software that does not work from them, they would refund my money if I bought it back within 14 days. So, I found a new source for software.Pros: It did not crash my laptopIt did not cause the modem to dial international callsCons:Doesn't workno tech supportdoesn't workno tech suppor
Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. (For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)
I am very disappointed with this product.  Using the features of it are very difficult (red eye, sizing, etc.) in addition, digital photos downloaded into Photo Album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen. I expected more from it but have found I have less.  I will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features
I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!!I even e-mailed Corel about this. Its been 4 days, I have NOT had a response.DO NOT BUY!!! I RATE THIS PRODUCE AS A -2 STARS
It's to bad I can't give negative stars as this package certainly deserves them. This program is total garbage. A gargantuan waste of both time and money. Seemingly with every menu change, it recatalogues your entire photo collection, on ALL DRIVES, which takes HOURS (like 12+) to accomplish. And, while it will scan and catalogue all of the drives on your computer, don't even think about selecting a folder and expecting it to display the contents of that folder and all of it's subfolders. Ain't a gonna happen... but is will happily go through and catalogue them again for you, but, of course, after waiting hours for the software to finish catalogueing, it doesn't display the contents.  No, that would be way to logical.After realizing that my computer had slowed to a crawl, I checked the memory usage and found that the Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe was using 6 to 7 times higher than any other program running, and that includes Norton Internet Security, a notorious memory hog! Guess we now know what the DELUXE part is!As far as I am concerned, Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe is neither intuitive nor is it the "Best of" anything. It is a creeping, bloated dinosaur and a total waste of your hard earned money.
I do not like software. It always hang no matter what I did. Maybe this is becasue it has not finished the index process? I had many many photos  in my computer.
I am extremelly disappointed with Roxio, the makers of CD Creators; especailly Easy CD Creator 5.   I purchased Easy CD Creator 5, sometime back from an affiliate of Amazon.com.  It was dispatched promptly and in very good condition.  I installed it on my computer running Windows 98.   After some initial problmes it was running fine.    A few days back I installed Windows XP professional on my computer, and I got a message that the CD Creator was not compatible with this version of Windows.  It hinted to contact Roxio.  I tried contact Roxio with the help of the link, but found it impossible to send them my message.   They have an automated "Roxann" that is so difficult to understand.  Next they invite you to a "Webticket" and you are supposed to mention your problem on it.   But when you submit your query or complain, nothing happens.  The site just stares at you dumbly!! There is no way to obtain Roxio's mailing address either.  So now I am stuck with this "Easy CD Creator 5" with no help from Roxio?
The first version of Easy CD Creator I used was CD Creator 4 basic. It was okay, pretty much what it said it was: basic. I got the upgrade to that from an Ebay auction and it worked pretty good. Later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new CDRW drives in good old version 4, I upgraded to CD Creator 5 Platinum (The version being sold here.) This too worked pretty good - for a little while. Then the operation was moved over from Adaptec to Roxio, and from that point onward, things have been more thorny than rosy.Roxio will REQUIRE you to register the product in order to download the (ONE) utterly essential update to keep this thing running. Perhaps you don't mind that, but I feel it's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy. Plus you have to keep track  of your password to the website and if you change ISP's you will have to RE-REGISTER. A hassle to say the least. Also , since Roxio took the reins, there are no further updates being provided. Instead Roxio tries to "encourage" (read "browbeat") you into getting the software upgrade for even more money. This upgrade will NOT work on Win98SE, which I still use for various reasons. So IF I were to upgrade the software AGAIN, I would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that I need and still use. If you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making, I applaud you. I prefer to keep a little cash for retirement.     It is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form, and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face, such as getting "Illegal Request" errors from Direct CD, or inability to format or erase CDRW's that was once possible in version 4. Also, any CDRW's created in version 4 MAY NOT be readable with the new software, or at the least there are some technical issues with this. At any rate, it is not neccessarily all that "EASY" unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand (or are willing to learn) some of the finer technical points in CD recording technology. I prefer not to be bothered with it, I just want to create some CDs.    I now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all, especially Direct CD, a program that originally provided the ability to do "drag and drop" writing of files to a Read/Write CD. Now I find that Direct CD is non-functional, and the only CD's I can write are CDR's, and there are problems growing in that area as well. Speed of the CDRW or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue. The software simply refuses to work as it once did.It shouldn't be called "EASY CD Creator". Perhaps "IRRITATING" CD Creator would be more appropriate. In Summary: This does not deserve stars. Perhaps a few "BLACK HOLES"? While I once would have given wholehearted supported this product, regrettably I cannot support it with the same enthusiasm now.  
I spent the last 3 hours trying to get support for this product. Although the site did not reject me it sent me through loops to get an "update" that when run, errored out as soon as it began
This program is average to below average in it's abilities.That said, just hope you don't need any Roxio tech support.Why? because Roxio's  support bites!You CANNOT contact anyone online or by email for help;whenever their dis-functional "web portal" [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop. I needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is NOT ALLOWED on the internet.It used to be you could download Roxio's PATCHES from any pc having internet access. Then burn patch[s] to a CD, or copy to floppy/jumpdrive.Then "sneakernet" the patches to the pc needing them.NO MORE.What happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on MY pc.[EZCD5 doesn't exist on my pc].Instead of simply letting me download it somewhere, like to my hard drive, vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc,[which won't work in my case as I'm not using roxio, nor have it installed on my pc]; apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process STOP/END and proceed to send the customer back to Roxio's initial patch download page.When you need a patch, all these endless loops and support gamesare enough to get me looking for a different product/different company.If you want to minimize human contact with customers, fine.But let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going.Don't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a WEB SERVER. That ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls.Then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem.IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.If a company won't provide access to PATCHES, even after I have logged into their website with username and password, [so they know is accessing their patches] AND they  don't offer any type of FTP site  as a download backup  option, then I sure as heck won't be buying anymore of their products.I see why Roxio bought up CeQuadrat and other companies.[Though I hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that]. When a competitor has a better product, why fight to improve your prodsuct's quality/features, when you can buy the other company out. Thank goodness Nero is not under the Roxio umbrella.
Despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of Windows XP, my XP machine refused to load Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless.Probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to XP you could keep it running with patches and updates.  So take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt.  If you cannot install the primary program, the update disc is of no use.The program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine.
The Easy Language 16 is only useful if you're already familiar with the language you wish to learn.  I've been studying French for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when I'm getting rusty.  The only problem is that it's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear.  The recorded speakers also don't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said.  This is good cause it's like listening to an actual French speaker and not a robot, bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said.  It will also go over basic French grammar but is totally useless if you don't already know basic French grammar.      I also tried to use this to learn Japanese.  Unlike French, I'm not familiar with the Japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare.  If all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a Romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out.  Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese.  For instance, in the grammar section it has the past, present and future "I am"  it's written in english then beside it it's written in Japanese.  You can't click them to have it sound out for you.  In the Japanese alphabet section all it has is the Japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out.  So it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in Japanese.  I do want to learn how to read, write and speak Japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read, write, and speak Japanese!   So my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with Japanese (NOT the Romanized(Romanjj) version) already in order to use this product.  Because of my experiences with this product I would say get it only if you know the languages you're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more.  Since I am familiar with French this product was pretty helpful but if I used this as a starter for the language I probably would have quit.  I'm searching Amazon for better Japanese books. So if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and CD's
My boss asked me to get this, so that he check out the Latin portion of it.What a waste!  The only Latin on this CD is *Latin* American Spanish.The interface was underwhelming. I needed to guess at what did what, because the controls are mostly icons. What's worse, there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program. Apparently though, the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back.  If you are learning the differences between US and UK English, its there!I gave this one star, only because I couldn't give it no stars
I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed
They have the hebrew backwards!! You are supposed to read hebrew right to left-the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right. I find it extremely confusing. I know how to read hebrew and I wanted to learn how to speak it.What a poor effort!
I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole, and I, too, couldn't find it.  There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole... except the jewel case which insists it's there.  I'm so dissapointed I haven't actually tested anything else out:  I consider this a VERY bad start
I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole, and that's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd. When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole, even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case. So it has been a complete waste of money for me, perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars.It also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language, but that is not possible either, u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source. I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product. If anyone can find creole on this cd I would be happy to stand corrected.PS I contacted IMSI and they say the cd's were mislabelled, there is no haitian creole on the cd, despite the fact that it is listed on the cover

If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support
Yeah, I know it's the industry standard, and it's powerful, and all that stuff.  But, MY GOD, what a freaking PAIN to use.  It's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch.  While the interface in CS2 is an improvement, doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should.  Frankly, I could draw better stuff faster with 1990's-era Macintosh drawing programs.  The drawing issues are compounded by the fact that -- in true Adobe spirit -- this program is incredibly bloated and slow.  It's slow doing EVERYTHING... I've never seen a program so slow starting up.  And every time you save a file (even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes) you get a "saving file" progress bar for a few seconds.  It's also incredibly slow to shut down... frequently taking about 30 seconds.  I'm running it on a Pentium M laptop, and I know this is not a "graphics professional" machine, but COME ON!  Let's get the lead out!  I just get the sense that Adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed.  That bugs me a lot
Microsoft Office can be handy to have.  The files you can open, edit and create with it (most notably .doc, .xls, and .ppt) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options. It's (relatively) intuitive.  It has a pretty broad array of useful functions.It's also obscenely expensive, considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc, .xls, and .ppt; intuitive interface; and functionality -- for free.I hunted up OpenOffice two years ago when I decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers, make basic presentations, or put together spreadsheets.  I was looking for basic functionality, but I was pleasantly surprised; OpenOffice does most of the neat tricks, too.  (Actually, it has a neat trick Microsoft can never replicate: it's open source, so it can respond to the needs of individual users.  You just say "Add this neat trick!"  and someone will likely be able to do it for you.)It is possible that Microsoft Office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that OpenOffice doesn't.  But considering the price differential, I wouldn't splurge on this before checking.
Office 97 was a pretty good product. The programs were powerful, had a decent interface (maybe not as good as the Claris products of the early 1990s, but not bad), and came with a ton of features all on one disc. The Office 98 release for Mac was pretty much the same thing. The only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant (paperclip) but it is easy enough to turn off.Office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me. I felt that the improvements were minimal (aside from a bit more stability in Word--anyone who has ever used Word 97 on a regular basis knows it's prone to crashing) and in fact detracted from the ease of use. One example is the clip gallery, which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that wouldn't have received decent reviews in 1988. Another is PowerPoint's outline feature. I always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller. When you use smaller displays like I often do this is a problem. The menus, which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them, were also an annoyance. The manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size.Office 2003 continues making the program uglier. Now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen. Again, this eats into the workspace. The clip art system is even more cumbersome, and many of the clips are online only now. The help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well. Now some people may not complain, but what if you're using a laptop in the middle of the country?I feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. In fact, the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful. On my Macs, I've switched to Keynote for presentations and Pages for some of my word processing because the new Office versions on that platform are similar.Some of the templates also look very 1997. Apple's programs are updated on a regular basis, and their templates look very modern. Now I know Microsoft adds some new ones now and then, but they should consider redesigning many of them--such as replacing the overused Arial and Times New Roman fonts with something a little more classy.The program is bloated way too heavily. I can run Office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1GB hard drive, but can't even get 2003 on it.A final gripe is that Access is not user friendly at all. File Maker is a better alternative, as it is easier to use and friendlier
Ok! Being the richest human being on the planet called earth, Bill Gates decided that he's not wealthy enough. So he released this Microsoft office 2003, which I really think is not much different from previous edition. The price is, as usual, very expensive. What's worse is that Bill Gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version. So mere mortals like us need to spend extra BIG money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents.I can see Bill Gates, being a deified bloodsucker, using $100 dollar bills as toilet paper, and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live. SO SHAME ON YOU BILL GATES AND MICROSOFT
Microsoft is simply sloppy with their programming!"Open Office" is a better program, is open-source (meaning if you don't want some paperclip's help, you simply don't download that part of it) AND OPEN OFFICE is FREE! It is also compatible with most of the functions that MS Office uses (and is upgraded with new features faster than MS's product, which is a rip-off!)MS's Office 97 was the best of the Office suites, even though it did have it's problems, Spending the money to supposedly "upgrade" to this (or any other Microsoft product for that matter) is simply burning your money!) OPen-source software is FREE, it's perfectly legal, it is open t anyone decompiling it, so if you want to make your own custom goodies, you can, but then there are so many written by so many people willing to share, you don't have to develop your own, as there are already *SO* many freebie ones (and some low-cost additions by some places, but most are free) that if you want whistles and bells, or even a Christmas theme in February, you can get it for OPEN OFFICE! (Not so with this or ANY Microsoft product for that matter)Simply sloppy programming - nothing more, AND you can get a fully functioning and compatable office suite for free legally
While Microsoft tries very hard to make Office "think ahead of me," they almost always seem to get it wrong.  The result is a package that consistently annoys me.  It is true that one can turn off the "helpful" hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering, however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody's business.  In my opinion, Office '97 was an excellent package, and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill.  As with many people, I use Office at work because I have no choice.  At home I've had good luck with StarOffice from Sun.  While not perfect, StarOffice has read and created files compatible with Microsoft Office very consistently in my experience, and it's a whole lot less expensive.  I am therefore hesitant to recommend Microsoft Office Professional Edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of Excel and/or need to use Access database frequently.    
I bought this upgrade because I thought it would let me share my contacts. It says so on the box, but it doesn't. It works just like the old contacts which you can't share with others except if you export it. No live sharing. Why couldn't they make it so I could put the file on my server? Or on a secure site? Then all my office can work off one contact list.50% or more of the time the business contacts can't be found when you search for a contact. It's like the business contacts is an add in that doesn't work with Outlook. Or you add contacts, save it, email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone. Also, lots of times when you try to SEND, the email won't SEND, it stays in the outbox. And repeatedly you open and hit the SEND button but it won't change to SEND status. Now, if you leave it in the outbox, sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email. Or sometimes you can FORWARD and SEND.. Geez, what a waste of money this upgrade was. We won't be using it on any of our other computers and we haven't bought if on the new computers we have ordered.
Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there. I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware. Star Office 8 is under $50 from Amazon and is fully compatible with Microsoft Office, and includes full functionalities of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Visio, and Access. Let me know what MS software I can buy under $100, let alone $50. Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the Microsoft Monopoly, and the dawning of the Era of Sanity in computer software.
In the last year I have tried this program, PC-Cillin  four sharewares from CNET, and f-ZA the only one that doesn't cause more problems than it solves. The others prevent me from doing wireless printing, slowdown the computer  generate false alarms
i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security.  Now i regret buying one.  Since ive installed it, IT SLOWED MY COMPUTER, ITS VERY VERY HARD TO CLOSE WINDOW AND WORSE WHEN I DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET I HAVE A HARD TIME LOGGING OFF.  everytime im on the internet,i get mad and upset. its not worth all the stress. i definitely dont recommend this product. now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to NOrton
Everything has been said about this product. When it's working, you're happy. With my 8 version, almost everything was fine. With the 10 version, it's a bloody nightmare. I'm giving up, throwing my Dazzle DVC150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my VHS to DVD. NEVER Pinnacle again
I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., 10.0, and this one.  And they've all had two things in common:1.  When the program works, it's superb.2.  The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out.  Studio Plus v10.5 is no exception.Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price.  At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.My advice?  Shop around.  Google the competition.  But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle
Crashes on every thing I try to do. I've never seen such a poor excuse for a program. I paid 70 dollars for it and am now throwing it in the TRASH.
I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free.There are several good products now so Pinnacle isn't your only choice.  I changed to Sony Vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve.  For super simple try Ulead or one of the others.
Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in ... Hold on ... let me start again.Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting ... Dang it! Give me a few minutes here ... Pinnacle Studio can assist ... (Samuel L Jackson-styled expletive) ... how many times is this gonna happen? Start and stop! Start and stop! Enough already!One more time. Now, what was I saying? Oh, yeah ... Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running.Got the idea?Just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the Pinnacle products. This is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions. After installing the program, installing the patches, uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches, I am still experiencing too many crashes.If you intend to use this program to piece together a video of Uncle Morty's birthday party, the family vacation or your neighbor's kid's bar mitzvah, the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness. If, however, your video projects fit under the category of "job description," then I suggest spending the money for Adobe Premiere
Let me sum up this software "total junk"Pinnacle will give you one free support phone call for help, then $25 for the next call.They give you free email support, but answer everything but your problem.   They try and blame it on Windows XP, and will have you reload Windows.I owned Studio 8, and it worked fine.   Went to Studio 9, and had a few problems.   Upgraded to Studio 9 Plus, and after a week of trying to make it render my projects with no sucess, and crash after crash, I removed it from my machine.They sent me an offer of their all new 10.5 plus upgrade, Hollywood FX, 3 of their Premium packs, and a hat that says Studio 10 on it.   This said that the program had been rebuilt from bottom up.    This program should be called "Crash after Crash", and the only thing that works is the hat.If you feel the urge to waste $100, and hours of your time, just buy this product.Look at the reviews on Studio 10, and the other Studio products, and most only have one star.   Out of over 100 reviews over 95% had one star.   I found one with 5 stars, but looking at the reviewers other reviews he is obviously an employee, or share holder in the company.   He wrote a 1 star review on a Sony competative product, and 5 star reviews for other Pinnacle products that you would not own if 10.5 worked
I've been a user of Pinnacle version 8 (which I loved), and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer DVDs.  What a disappointment this "upgrade" has been.  Crash after crash.  What is most disappointing is that Pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could "help" them develop a better product.  This means to me that they knowingly released bad code, and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a $100.  Guess what, I don't want to help Pinnacle build a better product.  I want a product that works when I purchase it.Lesson learned.  Next time I read a bad review on a product, I'm staying away
I was very disappointed with this program. But I was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases. Even so, the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating. I learned more Icelandic (along with correct pronounciations) while in Iceland than I did with this program. And besides, anyone under the age of 50 in Iceland speaks English
i was charged the full price of 49.95 with no $20 coupon inserted
I have owned eleven VCOM products and from now on, they don't have my business. The product touts itself in part as a vital tool when/if your machine crashes. If it does, be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program. You are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you can't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process. Sadly, customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you can't get through via phone...What you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products. Thanks, folks. Version 6.0 is also much slower than Version 5. Support for 5.0, by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out, despite the functionality of that program.   For the price, the software should work like a major player, rather than a dollar bin special. 
I would not buy it!  Hard to use. My machine runs slower since the install. 
An Internet search found complaints about not receiving rebates.  Why would they give you something for nothing?  I have had several rebate problems and most of them involved free items or insanely cheap items.  This "free" software could cost you $30 if the company decides they don't want to pay
Be advised, this Software is for a SINGLE USER, only licensed for one computer. I bought this for Home use after using SS% for 2 years and V-Com said it would no longer be supported of 03/06. I installed it on 2 home computers, it worked fine for 4 weeks, then it popped up a Box on my second computer that I couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer, I needed to buy additional license for each computer. When I tried to use it on my Main computer, it popped up the same message. So now it will not work on either computer. I uninstalled it and sent it back. Just because it's Cheap does not mean it's any good
I was using VCOM SystemSuite Pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction.  But, after I reconfigured my PC to "Standard PC", the software rejected my Serial Number, claiming I was using the software on another PC.  I only own ONE pc.  Technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc's.  Well, that is totally incorrect because, like I said, I only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house.  They have a Bug in their serial number checking process.  Anyway, they would not help me restore the software serial number because I could not furnish proof of purchase.  They think I am a crook. I'm not, I only want what I paid for to work
  After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something.   Also, I submitted the rebate form which came on the package, but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and I need to check w/ them. I did and they said they shipped what VCOM had provided them, which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade.  Not very impressed w/ either the software or the company. Would never buy another product from these guys, even when the price after rebate is 0. LOF
I agree with others who said it crashes the system. Overall, I found SS6 Pro had more problems than it was worth--even if it were free, it's not worth all the time and effort. Besides all the crashes, downloading the virus/spyware updates via dialup TAKES FOREVER! Each download runs 1 to 1 1/2 hours. BE FOREWARNED.In the end, I returned my copy to VCom, though to date I have not yet received a refund
I don't have a problem with the software.  It pretty much does what we need but reversing an error can be a nightmare.  Before I start this tirade, I should point out that the customer service reps were very nice.  But they don't have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service (please, read on).  The customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary.  (1) They want to have access to your checking account to pay for the annual payroll subscription!!  (2) They DO NOT SEND RECEIPTS!!  I help with the books for a small non-profit and paid for the payroll subscription on my own credit card.  The only receipt I could get was a copy of the invoice, which is not formatted to print correctly on an HP1200 (duh!!).  What is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts!  If you acquiesce to the checking account withdrawal, the only receipt you receive is the line item on your bank statement.  Have they every heard of a "paper trail".  Well you sure won't get one if you purchase the payroll subscription for this product.  I will start looking for an alternative to Intuit because they obviously don't understand some basic accounting and auditing principles.
This dictionary is not for the person who English is his second language. It does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word. In addtion, the micro doesn't work well with MS Word.
I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery!  When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also!  VERY BAD!  I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out
This is the worst thing I have ever bought. I bought it because I am having some trouble in spanish in school. I bought it thinking that if I gave a english word it would give you the spanish word or vise versa. But all it does is give you the definition and does not give you the english word.So save your self 20 dollars and don't buy thi
Although this dictionary's contents are extensive, the screen functions are relics from the DOS era.  They are laborious and clumsy.  To find a word for difinition, it has to be spelled perfectly, there's no list of proximations to the word entered.  Changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn't show up in the entry slot. If someone knows of a better software, I'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks!!  Maria McGowan 
The definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good. The user interface is quite honestly shameful. Software companies got away with this years ago, but there are now accepted standards for windows user interfaces (e.g keyboard short cuts are missing). Integration with Word 2003 is weak. Numerous bugs and exceptions and very slow
This product could put user/customer's life at risk. The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road. This is the worst product that I have used in my life.
The only redeeming quality about this GPS system is that it's cheap.  I used it on a 1,000 mile trip on the east coast the week after I got it.  The navigation is poor. I found that I often had to look over to the laptop screen because I was "off route" so often due to the poor maps. The system repeated the same annoying problems that I see in other feedback.1) The unit would show me being off the road even though I was on an Interstate. In this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around. 2) It directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction.  3) It could not locate a POI that turned out to be a few hundred yards away  4) It often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination  5) It doesn't provide a chime when it's time for a turn.  It will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead, but that might be the last time you hear an instruction.6) In one case, it got me to my destination (at least close enough) but couldn't guide me back to my starting point.The GPS receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well. But the maps are poor, as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980's computer generated voice.If you're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this ISN'T it.This is going back asap.
I rarely write reviews but I decided to write this since I had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad.  The review by "Reviewer: RC Lansing Mich" has listed all of my frustrations and I will not go over them again.  But the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review.  The summary of this product is that it is "highly unusable".  You will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again.  Yes, you can "manage" you way with this product.  However it is not worth your time and money.And last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database ... the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps, based on locations they have travelled, not covered by the original map database ... come on!
I have used MS streets and trips 2005 and 2006 for over a year. It has some map errors that I wish were updated. I read that The Delorme Street Atlas was far superior, so I bought it. It only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems. Not only is the mapping way out of date (Many years) Microsoft Streets and trips 2006 Maps are far more up to date. On many occasions told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even when the road doesn't exist in that direction. It doesn't even know the name of some very old roads Displays..."Unknown Name" While driving on very old established roads it tells me to turn onto a road that is actually an elevated overpass that I am driving 30 feet below. The program actually wanted me to get back on the freeway by making a U-turn from an off ramp to an on ramp. I have used Microsoft streets in all of these same areas and it is much more usable. The Delorme is very confusing and frustrating. I'm sending it back for a full refund
There's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted. This is definitely one of the worst products I have ever bought. I did not do much research. I think the data may be in there, but I could not learn how to make it work. The interface is horrific - unusable. Don't do it
I was expecting a lot more from these two CD's. It teaches you a few items of food, basic words like "Hello", Please" and "airplane" and even teaches you to ask "Where are the suitcases"... but then that is about it. I was really hoping for more... much more
The description of this product on the Amazon site does not match what I received. Like another reviewer mentioned, the product was actually shipped from the UK so it took longer, and several features listed as being in the product are not there, specifically, exporting/saving of loops is not allowed, and there is no library of 1000+ loops included either. It seems to me to be basically like a demo version. Also, even though it was advertised as being new in the box, all I got was what looks like a (used) CD with no manual or CD key - so much for upgrading later! I am returning it. The SKU should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out
I received this item today and was surprised1) It was shipped from overseas (UK)2) It came with only one CD instead of two like a previous reviewer thought3) No paperwork - it came in a clear case with no artwork, info, etc4) Sonic Foundry sold ACID to Sony in 2003 (according to Sonic Foundry's website) and SF no longer provides support5) I can't get this to register online, which seems a little dodgy, but other than that, it seems functional. No huge library of loops, either. Can't really say I got what I expected
In installed this product on a Dell Optiplex GX110 (admittedly not the latest, but still a very standard machine) running Windows 2000 with 512MB of memory. In spite of spending literally hours with the software I was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse, as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video. Without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls. Multiple emails to Broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that I refer to their Website for help. This site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems (like not being able to read the install CD).It would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver. Be prepared for possible frustrations with this product, with little support from the manufacturer. I cannot report on other features of the software because I was never able to produce even the walls of a structure
I've used CAD programs written in the 80's that are better than this.   I'll go back to Drawing Board 1.0 over this thing.  Not user friendly.   I can hardly draw a few walls without it crashing.  JUN
3D Home Architect is a complete crock. I have attempted to use it many times. After hours of reading and playing with it I am still unable to perform the most simple task. I own V1.3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years. I also spent lots of time trading emails with Broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and I got nothing. So henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned $. Sorry
I trusted that this software would do what it claimed to do and was so let down by its lack of performance that I am dumbfounded and left speechless.  During backup process I selected about 15GB of info to backup, spanning 4 DVDs.  Everything looked fine, except for TWO (2) simple errors that I received, indicating that those related files may not have been copied/backed up properly.  I figured no big deal, 2 files/errors out 15GB, I could handle that.  Based upon the false pretenses that my critical info was backed up properly (simple pictures, videos, mp3 files and Financial Files to include previous years tax files), I then proceeded to slick my drive.  Remember, only 2 simple, benign and almost inconspicuous errors during the backup process.  Everything looked great.During the restore process, I then received numerous errors, each of them requiring me to click 'Yes' when asked if I wanted to proceed.  I got tired of clicking Yes around the 100 or so mark and decided to click no.  When you click 'no', EVERYTHING is undone; there is no 'ignore all' function so I had to sit through every prompt and got tired of it and decided that proceeding with 1000 files and answering yes would involve too much pain for me.  I then selected a smaller group of files to have restored, only the 'My Documents' folder but ran into the same situation.  Eventually I ran a test on a small folder to have restored and still ran into the errors but pressed through.  Hardly any of the files were received error free and those that had issues were never restored.  My guess is approximately 2/3 or 3/4 of my files were not restored and of course none that really mattered made it.I had the latest update applied to the program, so that should not be the cause.  I would have done better to slick my entire hard drive without going through the backup process as I would have been at nearly the same place but without experiencing all the headaches, frustrations and an investment of hours, no DAYS of my time.The program has been recently purchased by Microsoft for inclusion in the Vista OS, I imagine.  It will do well as a Microsoft product, as it fails to deliver upon its promises
All I wanted was a way to identify some files, remember which ones so every time I wanted to backup, I would press "go" and the backup would start. AlohaBob was too "smart" for my use. First, it has this intelligent file finder that finds what is likely to be backed up.  I indicate that I want to select my own files (which it lets me think I can do). Then thinking it would bring me to browser window -- no, no, no...it still needs to waste time doing its indexing as if I had selected the "smart find". I then manually select my files (great!!). In trying to save the "template" of what files I wanted to backup, it requires that I make it a reoccurring backup with selected backup frequency (YUK!!). I want to back up when I get to it (about once a month, not when it wants to -- I am backing up to a DVD which I need to put in the drive).  OK, so now I am over that and the backup begins - GREAT!!!  Upon returning into the application a month later, I can not select my saved "template" to "run now", it will run when it is scheduled to run :(  So...I need to repeat the whole process just to get the same files as last time backed up.  I exchanged emails with the company and they understood but were not going to "add" the features I described.  Oh well - it looked like such a promising product.  Now I need to find another that satisfies my requirements
I really dislike this software.  I'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way.  First, when you initially select files and folders, your disk choices are "C:" or "ALL".  I have several disks and I want to pick and choose, but this program makes that really difficult.  Then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up.  Choose carefully, because you won't be allowed to change it later!  And if you want to do incremental backups, be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save, because you can't do it later.  Basically the entire job, future backups and all, must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over. 
Talk about junk! No search capability, mislabeled cds, some cds won't run - in short, YUK!
800,000 images without keywords - the only useful parts of this collection are the classic and traditional .tif's that you can take into illustrator and turn into vector.  The high res images aren't, the clipart is less than microsoft office online quality and I've gotten far more use out of a 50,000 image collection b/c they took the time to keyword and catagorize the collection.If you like to look thru a book and put in one of the 32 disks and then find the image - then this collection is for you.  If you want to have any sort of search capabilites, look elsewhere
I'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product.  There is no 800 number for tech-support, so it's a long distance call.  I have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person.  They offer only email support, but don't write back.  If you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you, but it never happens
This game was a little too hard for my tastes. Despite the fact that I played at the junior level I managed to get killed shortly after starting out. I also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once I left the room I couldn't find my way back (all the corridors look alike). So far I've fallen down an elevator shaft, gotten caught breaking and entering, been crushed by an elevator, frozen to death and been hit over the head...I've got to ask is this really appropriate for children
I just installed AutoRoute 2007. There is a feature in AutoRoute where you can display various places of interest on the map. In this version, for some installations you can not hide restaurants. This has been reported on the Microsoft UK AutoRoute community website. I loaded the program on a second computer with the same result. Both systems run Window XP Pro. This means for certain cities, like Paris, at certain magnifications, the map is completely cluttered with small green squares which indicate the location of a restaurant. MicroSoft only indicates that they will enter this bug into the work request for the next version of AutoRoute. They also say earlier versions were not affected. You may want to buy 2007 but check out your ability to show/hide all of the items of interest right away and be prepared to be dissappointed. I am going to try finding AutoRoute 2006 for sale
My desktop CD-ROM refused to recognize that the CD was in the tray. It did recognize other CDs. My desktop is a HP Pavilion 2000 with Windows XP HomeVersion. My laptop did accept the CD so I know that it is not the CD. I purchased the product for use on my desktop, not the laptop.I would appreciate instructions on fixing the problem
this software is useless.  it is a slow and a system resource hog.  you can download dozens of free apps that do a better job than this for free
I wanted a simple product with a good red eye removal tool.  This program does not do well with fixing red eye.  Software did not come with a manual. I am computer literate yet I found this software not easy to navigate. I found HP Essentials which is a free download from the HP website to be a better program.
I bought the software ( Digital Image Suite 2006 ) before I bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures I was going to take.  A BIG MISTAKE.I bought a Canon 30D camera and record my images in RAW format (*.CR2).UNFORTUNATELY, not all Canon .CR2 RAW files are the same.  So, even though the software says you can edit .CR2 RAW images, it depends on which camera made the image.Here is complaint number two -If you use Microsoft's Customer Service/Technical Support you will be routed to India - and they will just give you an answer that is vaguely related to your problem.After emailing several times and getting nowhere you will find out that you can't write to their Washington state headquarters unless you have the name of someone in the address.So, basically, Microsoft is the largest technical software company in the world with the worst customer service and no American technical support.Now, for the final complaint.  There is no link or method to get updates or upgrades for this program!  So, if I want to use a Microsoft software package to edit my photo images then I will have to buy a new software package - isn't that wonderful.
When printing cards it leaves a large border around front of card graphics.  The cards do not print anything like they are shown on box display with front of card display taking up the whole card. When I contacted tech support I was advised that in order to correct this problem my printer must have a borderless printing option.  My printer does not  I have been using another major greeting card software for about a year and half and never had this problem with that program. There is nothing on the outside of box under the system requirements that states this.On the outside of the box it says you can return for refund if not satified within 30 days and that the details are in the box.  There are not any details in the box and when I contacted the company I got run around in circles stating there were two companies involved with the software and was never given information on how it could be returned.  I am stuck with it
I tried unsuccessfully several times to install it.I contact their alleged support. They sent me what they deemed a "fix". The fix was awful. It caused my computer to crash and Print Shop would never work.Broderbund used to be a good company but I've had nothing but problems with their software of late.They need to rethink their products, their support, and their company focus.They are lousy at this point.They obviously don't give a dang about quality, support, or their customers
Do not order this.  Tech support from broderbund is basically non-existant.  One sorry product
On the front of the box it says it can be used for Professional photo editing and has 20,000 Professionally Designed Projects, when I received the box it had a disclaimer that the photos cannot be used for products for re-sale, I purchased this product to do a work at home video and spent all morning evaluating the different software's and now I find out it is totally worthless to me. I went to there website and it says allow 4-6 weeks for a refund! I am going to turn them into the FTC for false advertisement
I wanted to use this product to tape sporting events, as part of a promotions unit I belong to. I had used Videowave 7 which was OK and produced a more than adequate product, but would on occassion crash to the extent I would have to reload the software. I thought I would give PE 3.0 ago, since Adobe products generally have a good reputation. Well, it goes to show that you can't just rely on reputation. The program lets me down horribly when capturing the video from the camera. THe camera records DVD video (VOB files) straight to DVD. When I capture these files into the PE program, all moving images within the video become pixelated with lost resolution to the point of being useless. I have tried various other ways of capturing but always the same result. There is nothing to be done from that point...for me this program falls on the first hurdle!! It is unbelievable to me that a professionally released image processing algorithm could corrupt video so badly, and frustrating that I actually paid money for it...a first year undergraduate could have provided a better effort. I have subsequently gone through the motions to produce a video, and to be honest he layout of the settings, ease of applicaiton of various functions is quite good and better than Videowave 7 IMHO. I was able to produce quite nice edited products with intro, text and audio overlays very quickly. Still this isn't much use when the video itself had already been digitally butchered.If you are videoing things that don't move you may well like this product. If you are videoing dynamic scenes, give it a miss. Big disappointment
If you own a newer DVD camcorder that is manufactured by Panasonic, Hitachi, and others that records your movies in a .vro format you can not use this product.  You will have to buy an additional program that will cost about $40 to convert the .vro format to a avi, wav, or mpeg format.  If you own a camcorder that records in .vro do some research before you waste $80 on this program
This is a very capable program that has too many nuances. For just a simple DVD burn it is far to complex. Definitely for the advanced user, I am sorry that I spent the money
I really thought that office was better proir to the whole XP upgrade, but that I will leave to other discussions. This product is your standard Microsoft office products. I am fairly sure that most have experienced their products. There are no surprises and the added bells and whistles aren't worth the upgrade unless your are a VBA programmer. Now, having gone through all of this, I DO NOT rcommend that you purchase this product, but purchase the Student version. Same product - HUGELY different price.
Yes, I love Microsoft Office. It's incredibly user friendly, it has wonderful features, most of which I don't even know how to use, and it's spelling and grammar checking features are the best of it's kind. I've been fortunate enough to have been a student up to now in my life and therefore did not have to buy Microsoft for my personal use, the school would always buy one for me. And of course there are always illegitimate means... but I'm not advocating piracy here.However, I would be the last person on earth to consider using Microsoft Office if I had to pay $350 for it. It's an insane price. consider the alternatives:Open Office: Does everything MS Office does, some things even better. I love how you don't need to buy or install anything extra to type mathematical formulas in Open Office. The best thing about this, however, is that it's FREE!Google Docs and Spreadsheets: This one is even better. Not only is it free like everything else from Google, you can COLLABORATE IN REAL TIME with  anybody else on the internet to write your word documents! Nothing beats that, it's just the most wonderful thing that Google has done
Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there.  I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware.  Star Office 8 is under $50 from Amazon and is fully compatible with Microsoft Office, and includes full functionalities of MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Visio, and Access.  Let me know what MS software I can buy under $100, let alone $50.  Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end of the Microsoft Monopoly, and the dawning of the Era of Sanity in computer software
Font manager is not user friendly.  There is no logical indexing or grouping of fonts.  User is forced to hunt and peck
Tough to upgrade if you have an earlier version on your machine.  Also, poor layout of controls make clicking on wrong button really easy.  They still have not gotten it right
This year, instead of renewing my subscription to Norton system Works 2004, I thought would be a good idea to bring it up to date. I purchased Norton system Works 2007. The 2004 version worked fine for several years, while the 07 version could not be installed on my XP professional PC. The Norton "consumer firewall" worked perfectly. They make it very hard to get effective help (unless you want to pay them $9.95 per call). Several sessions on their complementary "live chat" system proved useless. In the end, efforts to resolve the problems simply wasted an otherwise perfectly good weekend. I returned the product to Norton for a refund. Their return procedures indicate that I will wait six weeks to get my money back. Just wonderful
NSW 2007 (or 2006) premiere is useless when it comes to VISTA...and considering it comes pre-packaged with EVERY PC known to man (desktop or laptop) this is unforgiveable.Norton AV has an update but that is a far cry from the ~$100 price of SystemWorks that MUST be uninstalled according to MS VISTA.MAYBE with the 2008 versionTruth be known, System works has saved my aZZ a number of time since the 2003 version but now it is useless
Systemworks continues to grow, taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer, and I'm likely to buy an alternative next time I update.  Note it stops working entirely if you install upgrades to your computer - a new hard drive, motherboard, or processor and Symantec requires you to spend a fortune on another copy.  I like the basic functions, but there's too much baggage to recommend this product anymore
This is a terrible suite.Read the fine print very carefully:  It will not work on RAID configurations of any kind.  It will tell you that in the install (thanks a lot...kinda late?)I found its support on recovery disc of USB hardware unstable.This is a very unstable, even errant, set of programs.  It also tries to take over a lot of system elements
I've a Norton user for many years.  I 'upgraded?' from NAV 2005.  This product was a pain to install.  I had to uninstall Zone Alarm, which isn't noted anywhere.  I've never had to do that before.  The installation process required rebooting multiple times.  In the past it had been an easy process.  Not anymore!  I will not buy Norton in the future
While installing Norton Antivirus 2007 XP, a Norton message flashed that I must delete Webroot for MSN. I did it, and it resulted in crashing the session. Tried first the paying phone support and gave up after 2 hrs wait. Then ried the online chat. The wait went on for 9hrs, started #245 in the queue and by now in lline at #59 I realized this was not the Norton I'd used for so many years, I ordered Kapersky anti-virus.     
I've had Norton Anti-virus since 2002 on my 2002 Dell machine which meets teh program requirements.    Its gotten so slow as to be really annoying to use.It takes 30+ seconds to open a 2 page word document.  When Norton is updating the virus file, the machine slows to a crawl, instead of downloading quietly (and a bit slower) in the back groundIts slowed the machine to such a great extent that we don't use sleep mode anymore because when the machine is woken up it can take 10 minutes on a DSL to update.Its so slow that I am trying Kaspersky 6.0.  I don't know if thats better or worse, but since I don't go to "dangerous" sits or perfom lots of downloads its got to be better than teh current state.The way I look at it - with Norton Anti-Virus my machine functions 100% of the time as if its being slowed by a virus.  Anything is bette
Used Norton antivirus the last 3 years. getting product in tax software promotions.  No problems until I installed 2007 6 days ago, when my system became really slow and then I was unable to access the internet.  Since their customer service phone number is not in the User Guide but buried in their website, I was thankful my husband's laptop was available. The first rep became exasperated when his scripted suggestions did not resolve my problem after 1.25 hours and tersely told me he was sending me an email file that would solve my problems.  I had identified it was the Worm Protection causing the problem so I turned that off, accessed the file and ran it.  My computer updated twice with no change - if the Worm Protection was on, I wasn't going to be able to access the internet.     Worked up my patience and called that evening, only to hold for 48 minutes.  Finally got another native of India who spoke English worse than the first guy. At one point, we were waiting on a restart and I asked her a question about the computer being slower with the 2007 version and she responded, "OK, yes".  Long story short, I hung up an hour later with a link for an update to the 2007 product which I was assured would solve the problem and an email address for her manager. During these two calls, the software was uninstalled, reinstalled, and tested and I spent several hours using the online support.  I updated the product and it worked for a couple hours.  Then I was right back where I began, unable to access the internet unless I turned off the Worm Protection.I started the day with 360 days remaining on my subscription but once I updated, the protection center now says my subscription is expired. When I check my Norton account online, it shows I have almost a year remaining before expiration and all their tips to update the proection center have pathetically failed.Sent an email to the management address I was given, but of course, haven't heard anything.  I am uninstalling this product and will never use Norton again. 
I tried to like this product.  As previous reviews have said it has significant design limitations.  If you only need a 2D floorplan there are better tools for the same money or less.  The object libraries that come with the tool - furniture, fabrics, etc. - are really lame.  This limits it's value as an interior design tool.  I did not attempt to return it so I cannot comment on their return policy
This lame program is completely limiting.  You can not even type in your own text.  You are supposed to use the few quotes they want you to use.  It is not at all user friendly either. I am so sorry I purchased this
This is a good product, except it keeps shutting down when I have my outlook or when I have a web page open.   My main goal for an antivirus would be to run when I search the web or get in new emails!   What good is it if it shuts down when these are open!   It did find a trojan on my first scan.  This was one that Norton missed.  I will be getting NOD32 soon.  Sorry this product did not work for me! It was very easy to use
Feeling more than a bit fleeced by McAfee's overpriced "subscription" renewal every year, I decided to give Kaspersky a try.  Installation went smoothly and everything seemed fine for 2 or 3 weeks.  Then one day my computer would not boot---just stalled on a blank screen right after the Windows XP splash screen.  When trying to boot up in safe mode, a list of the drivers currently loading scrolled down the screen.  It stopped at a file called kl1.sys and hung there forever.  A little research at work showed that this was a Kaspersky file.  It may be just a coincidence that my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing the new antivirus program, but I doubt it.  Attempts to use a recovery disk failed.  A trip to the local computer shop revealed that the data on my hard drives (which were in the inscrutable RAID 0 format) could not be recovered (unless I wanted to ship them to a recovery shop, and nothing on them was worth that much).  So they're going to reinstall windows, I'll have to do reinstall a shipload of software when I finally get my computer back, and, yes, I'll lose all the data that was on there.  (Gee, good thing I backed up all the kids' photos---well, most of them.  Thanks, Kaspersky!)Anyway, perhaps my attempts at recovering the OS caused the worst of this.   Whatever the case, I believe the boot failure was caused by either the Kaspersky file being corrupted or a virus.  Who knows.  Kaspersky is to blame in both scenarios.  I do know one thing: I am not going to tempt fate by loading this program on my computer again.And Kaspersky has yet to respond to my e-mail.  I got an automated "we received your e-mail" response, but nothing more, even though they state that they usually respond within a day or two.  That was over a week ago.  If in fact their software is in no way responsible for my computer flaking out on me, then I still do not apologize for the one-star rating, given their horrible customer service.If you decide I'm insane or that this was just a fluke, at least do yourself a favor and make a decent boot disk for yourself before installing this product.  That might mean the difference between losing data/spending $$$ and just being inconvenienced.  And don't expect much assistance from Kaspersky should things go wrong.
This software does not provide even the basic red eye fix.  It turns them a light shade of grey, maybe. It is horrible.  This to me renders it useless. It is for the most basic of users.  There are no real manual functions to speak of, and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it.  It has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly,I would say do not buy.  Seller was great, product is poor.
It isn't very user friendly.  I have other software that is much easier (Adobe Photo Shop).  This one will take some time and effort to get used to and work with. 
On install the 1st problem encountered was that it replaced  my pictures folder, with another containing only "sample picture", yep  it took out a folder on install with no request or user action to do so. Regardless of how it works as an image editor such behaviour precludes its further use. This program seems to be unsupported by MicroSoft, least their support site won't let you mail them on it,  so when it does hack up your file structure. SO program cost me $15 recovery effort on pictures, over $50. Just wonderful.
Caution: Giving this software to your enemies will gaurantee that they will become mortal enemies, if they are not so already. 1 star is overrating this "product". I am only writing this review to satify some sort of altruistic urge. This software isn't worth a second more of your time. Just click a link now. Good bye! You are still there? OK, read on. I write computer code (C++, Java, C#) for a living and I could not get this software to work correctly. Starting up the "main console" application (read: service) kept turning off the Firewall (service). I could turn on the Firewall - but only if the main service was off. Brilliant! Well done guys on this festering sore of a pile of software. Glad I got my $50 back with the rebates, they should have paid me at least $100 for the wasted time. I spent an hour with their help, chat (which was slow and ineffective) and another 30 minutes tweaking the registry, all to no avail, but lots of frustration. I'm looking for another Firewall/Virus solution now
The positive about PCcillin is that it seems to work okay.  It scans email and the firewall works okay.The negatives:- It supplies a lot of warning requests.  This would be good, but they aren't explained in an easily understood dialog so you end up answering yes to permission requests without always knowing if that's the best choice.- Even though it supplies 3 license keys the program is a little buggy and sometimes loses the keys.  If it loses the keys it disables the ability to update or click the customer service live chat button.  The process of restoring the key on the computer isn't too hard, but requires a bit of assistance from customer support.- Customer service is slow.  Sometimes I've been lucky and gotten into support chat right away, but sometimes I've had to wait 40 minutes or more.  The support personnel don't seemed to be trained technicians, but just phone support people reading through a manual with canned answers.  Getting to the right answer can take a long time and a lot of trial and error.I have used PCcillin for about 2 years now.  The latest version definitely isn't as good as it's previous versions.  I wouldn't recommend this product
After using this product for Mac for over 10 years.  I'm done.  The price keeps going up, the "tax-help" within in the program keeps diminishing and the customer service is almost non-existent.  The server meltdown this year was the last straw.  Their servers weren't too busy to let me pay to efile.  But, apparently they were "surprised" by the number of people that they allowed to pay for their service.  Baloney.  I'll use a pencil and paper next year before I give Intuit another $100. 
This software now constantly tries to get you to upgrade to a "better" package - the schedule C for small business.  I used to like TurboTax, but it has really gotten to be a pain. And finally, I spent two days trying to e-file, always getting a Server busy message from Intuit.  This is AFTER they got my credit card number and $34. to file the fed and state tax returns.  So I had to hand assemble the return and make the trip to the Post Office.  Intuit lobbied the Gov to let them keep this big $$$ plum, and then screwed it up.  They had this same problem last year, and it is WORSE this year. Time to call all our representatives and get E-File FREE from the IRS.  It saves the IRS money, far more than it costs.  Why is Intuit allowed to suck this much more from us after making big profits on the package
I use turbotax every year and I would E-file also. It says I can E-file for $16.95 and it even says that's all it will cost on one of the last windows.  Then right before it is about to transmit it says $16.95 for federal plus $16.95 for state plus 2.5 percent what I owe to some "third party" company, thats $25 for each 1,000 you owe.  If I'm paying some third company to transmit my return than why am I paying turbotax to do it also?So ok I'll print it out and send it in. It wants to print out every worksheet and statement for a total of 53 pages.  It no longer gives you the option to just print the pages you need.I am now cornered into paying the extra $90 to efile or go through the torture of printing out 53 pages in which I need only 5 or 6.Dirty trick.It makes the total cost $130.  It would of been cheaper and more efficent going to a good accountant.Other than that the program has worked even easier than ever before
After years of e-filing fees being included with the purchase price, it would have been more forthcoming for TurboTax to put a large sticker on the front of their box alerting buyers to the price that they will pay for e-filing each return.I lost the value of my entire state return - and then some - through e-filing fees: $44.95 (plus tax) for the program, $16.95 (plus tax) for each return e-filed (I filed two) and a little bonus fee to the company that handles the [credit card] transaction (that fee is never quoted in the program and I will have to wait for my credit card statement to find out what that is).  In addition, anyone who chooses to have the fees deducted from his/her refund has to pay an additional $30.The product does what it says.  But, for the cost, and less-than-honest way in which the change occured (it almost seemed deceitful - hence the single star rating), I would have preferred to have given my money to my friendly neighborhood accountant.People expect change, even if they don't like it.  But, suprises that cost customers money are never welcome and drive customers away.  Surely the marketing/advertising gurus can think of a way to alert the customer of a significant change such as this and even put a "positive" spin on it.  "Filing fees only $16.95 [per return] - less than the cost of a tax professional . . ."No more TurboTax for me
Turbo Tax is less than impressive in handling stock and option transactions. It seems to view short sales as errors, reporting that the date acquired is later than the date sold. It does not appear to have a provision for tagging a short sale. It does not appear to have a provision for properly dealing with dividends on stock held for more than 12 months, but covered by disqualifying call options. Its screens for schedule D and D1 are awkward - it would be much better to have one large table screen for all transactions, with tags to set short term and long term tax application, from which D and D1 could be formatted for filing.
I have used Turbo Tax for the past 3 years so this year like a drone I purchased it at Amazon. Great price by the way. Well I receive the product and try to load it and find out as of July '06 it isn't compatible with windows '98. Now I have to send it to Turbo Tax for a refund. Its great that they are doing that but they should have put something on the front of the box. After a 45 minute call to Turbo Tax they finally agreed to credit me the difference of $20 for the purchase of their online software. The online software was the same exact program I purchased from Amazon but they charge $20 more...go figure. It sounds fishy and deceitful to me. I will never buy their software again!
I have been using TurboTax since I started working full-time after graduating form college. This year TurboTax really drops the ball:1) I didn't have any ESPP transactions for a few years. Tax year 2006 I had some, and that was when I realized that nowadays they force you to use TurboTax premier for ESPP calculations. The last time I had ESPP in 2000 or so, the deluxe version at that time could assist you to calcuate ESPP transactions with wizards. Now you can't with deluxe version.2) For first-time married-filed-joinly couples, they have to do a lot of work trying to merge their filed-single returns from 2005. The deluxe version simply does not handle this at all. Even if it helps you transfer the 2005 returns, they don't merge the data properly. For instance, if both couple have short/long-term capital loss carryovers from 2005, the deluxe version does not do that for you. Same for state/local taxes paid/refunded. Worse, if even if you try to correct it, sometimes you can't. There is obvious bugs, and I have to choose override from the menu to directly update the forms.3) Nitpick: when you choose to print out the every forms, by default they print out all those only for federal taxes. I have to go to the State tab and choose my state, go back to the print menu, to print state tax forms.I am not sure it that may be because this year is the first year I use the Mac version of TurboTax (I use PC versions before). But I really do not have a good tax preparation experience this year. Next year I may consider to switch
The product performs inconsistently. It failed miserably when it tried OCR on a page printed in comic sans, for instance, mistaking a's for g's, and @'s for a's, etc.  In short it was worthless for scanning in something as simple as a list of names and email addresses.   It's "OK" when doing some fonts. And generally manages to figure out where the images are.  The interface is supposed to be simple, but is counter-intuitive, and confusing to learn.Scanners are "iffy" -- may work, may not, so make sure you test in the 30 day trial period.  Support?  Forget unless you want to pay.  Not even a single support call is included in the package. I will NOT buy or upgrade with this company again unless they are willing to provide at least a minimum of a couple of support calls or emails. I've had almost all the versions before this, and to be honest like this one less than what was before. If you want to try it, buy from a source that will honor the 30-day money-back trial period. You may need it
I bought OmniPage 15 yesterday morning as a download, and have been trying to activate it ever since. After several calls to customer service, forty minutes on hold to speak with a tech rep (who emailed me two links that don't open), I'm no closer to being able to use this program. It seemed to work okay in the few intro uses allowed before you had to activate to continue, but even then it kept wanting to reload with every page I scanned in. The product might be a good one--I'm not a fair judge of that--if only you can get it to work. As others have pointed out, tech support is expensive. If my experience is any measure, it's also worthless. Customer service is unresponsive, unpleasant, and unprofessional. In one call to Customer Service, I was asked if I typed the letters in the serial number as capitals and the O's as zeroes. When assured that I had, several times, she replied, "Then I can't help you--call the tech department," and abruptly hung up. To add irritation to insult, in the forty minutes I was on hold with the tech department, I listened to repeated assurances that a "reepersentative" would be with me shortly.  Not recommended.
Both versions of Scansoft cause my installer to have problems. Mainly it tries to re-install Softscan every time I start up Softscan. Also It has started to try and reinstall Softscan if I try to right click on a JPG. There is very little to no chance of getting any help from Scansoft (Nuance)to debug this problem. Save your money and buy some thing else
Omnipage is a buggy piece of software which is prone to throwing errors and mysterious crashes (often occuring at the end of a lengthy process).  Nuance provides no support and when you attempt to contact them they want $9.95 for an email question or $19.95 for a phone question.  You might expect this from an inexpensive piece of software but for the cost of Omnipage you would expect some support.  I recommend finding something more reliable from a company that provides some measure of support
The real headache began when I attempted to "activate" the program.  I spent hours trying to activate it, to no avail.  I got messages saying that the serial number was invalid and a host of other problems.  Now, I would just like to get my money back.  I have used ScanSoft's stuff in the past and have been pleased with it, but, for whatever reason, OmniPage 15 has become, for me, an expensive nightmare.  After having spent many hours trying to activate it, I still have not succeeded.  Their support leaves a lot to be desired.  For one thing, they keep "bankers hours" so don't expect to get any help on the weekend or after hours
I've been using a Mac for the last 10+ years and I had assumed that Windows had gotten better since Win 94.  Boy was I wrong.  It amazes me that the entire world runs on this awful excuse for an OS.
I brought Microsoft Windows XP Home Ed.SP2, to use on my Mac BookPro as a guest O/S. The software works fine on my Mac BookPro, the only downside was as soon as it was installed I had to update the software with 98 Security updates. For the software to be new right out of the box, it took up a lot of space on my harddrive with the Security updates, and the updates on my Mac BookPro have only been 6, since the day I brought my computer, compare the difference in updates to see which software has a lot of problems.
  I had to work with a pc and windows because of my profession......architect..  My firms have always used architectural desktop.  Unfortunately, it only is compatible with a pc.  NOW  !!  finally I purchased an exquisite iMac.. and when need be, I can run architectural desktop on it in windows to get a few things done..    Apple vs PC ?No comparison.... and my iMac is so sexy it makes me smile.. so kill me.  
Other than the substandard security; the endless hours you will spend trying to clean out spyware, protecting against viruses, etc.; and the fact that Microsoft has built in it's own spyware to notify them when you are connected to the internet, it's pretty good. It is a good evolution of their graphical interface and quite intuitive. If you are concerned about your ability or willingness to protect yourself against malicious attack from internet scumbags, buy a Mac. As you face the upgrade to MS Vista, you're going to need to upgrade your CPU, so you are essentially at a crossroads.Good luck

My last Roxio product was "Easy CD Creator 5." When I switched to a Mac I naturally expected "Toast" to be the Mac version of this product. I am extremely disappointed to find that the crippled video editing features in my (many years old) version of CD Creator is miles ahead of what they include with the most current and up to date version of "Toast" which I unfortunately own. It allowed me to edit video clips, create several levels of customizable menus, customize the size of compression, and burn to a DVD which played on my standard DVD player. Toast can create one uncustomizable  menu level, has NO editing, and locks up every time you drag a file into it. They (in the product description) say it reads mpegs but it's more like it freezes every time it sees an mpeg. It doesn't even read every mpeg reliably. The only thing I can find that Roxio adds to Toast that isn't in my old version of CD Creator is more enhanced MP3 and music features (which isn't what I bought it for). I may have been better off using "Parallels" in combination with CD Creator. I am sorry but compared to Roxio's CD Creator (which is basically the same price), Toast seems to have been designed by total IDIOTS. And I always thought that Mac software was better for working with multimedia
While I am sure the product does what it offers, this is the second version of Elemeents that I have not been able to load on my computer.  That's where the fun begins - Adobe's support is dreadful.  Their website is unusuable - other than constantly trying to sell you additional products and services - and they have no human support on weekends
I have usedPhotoshop 7, and likedit.I beleive,Adobe has made the PhotoshopElements 5 unnecessarily cumbersome in termsof downloading,saving,etc
I bought Adobe Elements 5.0 because I thought it had more features than Microsoft Digital Image Suite, and it probably does. Getting the Adobe software to work is the trick. I even bought two books to help me learn how to use Adobe and I still can't get it to work right. I should have stuck with Microsoft, it is much easier to use.
It's just too complex compared to Print Shop 21 and as far as I can tell it has very few added features.Ray Gawronsk
TurboTax has what looks like it would be a geat feature -- the ability to import data from your financial institutions so that you don't have to enter all of your stock sales by hand.  Some of the cost basis (how much I bought the shares for) was empty, so I had to go in and enter them manually.  No big deal, just took a few minutes.However, when I went to e-file, the program had flagged these changes as "overrides" to computed values, and refused to let me e-file the return.  Equally bad is that if I just leave the fields empty -- as they came from Charles Schwab, then it looks like I got the stocks for free, and have a huge tax bill (that is incorrect). So, after many hours of trying to see if I could change the field so that it would not be flagged as an "override", I determined from other upset users of TurboTax in the forums on intuit.com that I was out of luck.  I'd have to print it out and mail it in.As a special reward, TurboTax doesn't even tell you what attachments you need to include on the return that you are now forced to mail in.  The help screen says that what it prints out will tell you what to include in the return.  That's wrong.So, the main reason I got TurboTax was to e-file.  Now, I get to print it out, find out all of the crap that I have to attach to the return, mail it in, then wait for weeks to months to get my return.Thanks, Intuit!!!!The saddest part is that H Block had sent me a free copy of TaxCut before I bought TurboTax.  I should have used that before I spent $30 on a piece of crap like TurboTax.  Won't do that again
We purchased this to make sure we didn't miss anything re: stock options.  The program kept including a ghost set of options of a different type, though they were not entered twice.  It took me quite sometime to get them deleted.  It also said we had to pay estimated tax next year-which isn't true since we overpaid (as we have always done).  Too many errors for a tax program
I bought the Mac version of TurboTax Premier, and I installed it on my Mac with OS 10.3.9. After doing my entire return, I clicked to e-file and received a message saying, "Could not load attribute," This error box gave me the options to continue (which just took me back to the e-file page, which led me to the same error message) or connect to Intuit online support. The Intuit support site said, "This error occurs when attempting to file electronically.  If you are connecting through a router, try bypassing the router and filing again.  If the error persists, it may be necessary to file by paper.  We are currently working to resolve this error. . . . To be notified as soon as we have an answer, click here to sign up."I don't have the technical know-how to "bypass the router." I also figured that if Intuit hadn't solved the problem by March 26 (the day I was ready to submit my return), they probably weren't going to, even if I were willing to hold onto my return until I'd received word they'd solved the problem. So I ended up mailing in my return. If I'd known up front that I wouldn't be able to e-file, I probably wouldn't bought the program.
Isn't this a Mac product? I thought Mac products were supposed to be (A) stable, and (B) easy to use.  This product is stable, (once I upped my RAM to 2GB) but at 512MB it brought the system to a crawl. But as far as ease of use--I'm not a dumb guy (although my kids may argue the point) but this product is really a victum of itself. It is too hard for the "Express" audience and is really intended (in my opinion) ONLY for profression Final Cut Pro users.  In other words, if you use Final Cut Pro at work, and want something on your home-Mac, the Express version is a great value. You already know it and people have paid you to get used to it.But if you're a iMovie user, Pinnacle Systems Studio user, Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0 user, this product seems like I'm trying to fly the Space Shuttle.How do you output WMV with this product? You can do it in any of the PC-based products, oh, and they also output Quicktime so why does Apple have a hangup about WMV?I recently asked in an Apple forum "How do you do Picture in picutre?"  I got a great response from an experienced user.  "It only took a couple of minutes, just do these 6 steps..."   Great, in Premiere Elements or Pinnacle, I click on the PIP icon and its done.  I didn't have to do 6 obscure steps.The product is also one of those old fashion "Million Windows all over the place" applications. You try to minimize the thing by pressing one of the tiny little minimize buttons (like all Mac apps have) and it closes only that window of the app, like the preview window, not the timeline, not the browser.Bottom line... if you already use, know and love Final Cut Pro, this is a low-cost way to get a similar product on your own PC (although the Academic version of the Pro version is pretty affordable too). I don't see the point of this product unless its just to provide a low-cost entry into Final Cut Pro for people who use Pro for a living
This is among the most disappointing Symantec products!!!  When one tries to log in to the infovault, the login box is often empty! There is no way to submit the information.  It is also impossible to get a straight answer from Customer Service. BRING BACK THE OLD PRODUCT, PLEASE!!!!  Have been a Norton customer for years....this one is just not great!!
Norton old password manager worked much better.  It is a pain to use especially if you use the same password for serveral different websites.  After using it for a couple of weeks, most of the time not working properly, the final straw was that it suddenly stopped recognizing my Infovault password.  Several emails to Norton and nothing but worthless repsonses.  Hours wasted trying to get help from their website!  Even when I just wanted to know if I unstalled the product would password manager still work, no response.
I purchased this product with the hope that it will help me protect my computer without too much overhead and interference. The password manager is quite useless. In more than half the times it did not enter passwords. In cases where it entered passwords, it took about 5 seconds to do so. It also asked me if I want to store passwords repeatedly for the same site.It interfered with the operation. It did not let me go to sites like paypal and charles schwab. When I contacted Symantec support, their response is to disable the Phishing protection when I want to go to these sites.My quicken started having problems. I had to restore old backups and it took me 2 days to finally figure out that it is Confidential that is causing the problems. I would have given this s/w 0 stars if it is possible. Now, I uninstalled the software from my computer and have no intention of re-installing it.I can't believe that a company like Symantec releases software that is so buggy and unusable
This is a terrible product. I could not even load the program onto my machine. I had the same 2006 version and had no trouble loading that one.I sent the product back and requested a refund to my credit card. I cannot recommend this product and if you take a chance and order it I hope that you have better luck then I did
It's time to switch to any product BUT a Symantec one: what was once the best security software company for PC users is now the worst. It was time to upgrade my Systemworks Premier to the 2007 version, so I checked out the '07 features online. But where was Password Manager? Hell, I have 187 passwords and logins I DEPEND UPON Password Manager to fill in -- at least 30 of them a day. After an hour on the phone with allegedly 'English-speaking' Symantec CSR's in Bombay, the story I got was that customer surveys prompted them to 'drop' Password Manager. Not being stupid, I said, 'let me guess, Symantec's going to roll out a stand-alone Password Manager to extort another $40 from me'. 'Oh, no, sir, no, no...'And here it is: a $[...] rip-off, nothing but Password Manager -- not so cleverly disguised as 'the Vault' -- along with other features IE7 provides for free, and marketed as a 'new' online security program. Symantec seems to put more effort into playing marketing games with their customers than they do into making the programs they sell WORK correctly. Norton Anti-Virus is a MESS; it's once-a-week Wednesday night updates are now a joke: launch your attack, release your new virus on a Thursday morning and you'll have millions of NAV subscribers at your mercy for at least a week. Three times in the past few months, NAV has failed to stop an attack -- after several years of never failing. Systemworks too seems to be causing more problems than it solves (I'm continually rolling back to undo 'fixes' One Button Checkup or WinDoctor creates, after the 'fix' crashes my system). Goodbye, Norton, hello McAfee -- or ANYBODY else. This rip-off -- deleting Password Manager from Systemworks only to regurgitate it as this bug-filled mess called Norton Confidential -- is the last straw
This product caused my IE 7 browser to hang just about every time I used it.  It causes internet pages to load very slow.  This product scans every internet page before it will load the page.  Many of the features that this product boasts come standard and FREE with the new IE 7 (such as phishing protection).  This product is NOT compatible if you use Norton System Works
I recently purchased this software and had to uninstall it.  In my case, I was unable to get into my Quicken account, which is password protected.  One of the features of Confidential is an "Information Vault" which stores all passwords.  I was prompted to enter the Quicken one as well, but chose not to as I felt this would defeat the purpose of having a password set up in the first place.  After that, when I would enter the Quicken password, my machine would just hang up.  The only way I could get in was by opening it in safe mode.  I believe that this product sounds appealing on the surface, but when you get down to it, it promises more than it can deliver.  I also think that when it comes to internet security, the best solution is to take reasonable precaution.  If you respond to an e-mail requesting your account numbers and passwords, a software package is not going to save you.I purchased this product based on my previous experience with Norton products and have been quite satisfied with their performance.  Thus, I was extremely disappointed with this product
As others have noted, this product prevents AOL from loading on my machine - it just stalls (AOL is using a connection via Cable). It also "automatically" registers itself with Symantec and starts the counting of the 1 year subscription unless you cut of internet access. I removed it from that machine (a Toshiba Laptop) and installed it on my backup Dell (an older Pentium 3 866mhz). Both were running XP with the latest updates.  It slowed Internet Explorer to a crawl and locked it up when I attempted to first write this review.  It also slowed overall performance, when not in the browser, though this seems illogical.  I uninstalled it (it was the only Norton product on the machine) and it left Live Update installed until I manually started the removal of it. Fortunately everything is back to normal after removing all.  This is truly dangerous software for those with at least my type of equipment:  Stay away unless you have very poor browsing security and a machine that does not choke on it
I purchased this updated version 1/5/07.  It does not print correctly, and technical support assured me that the developer is "working on the problem" and a "fix" is soon to come.  This is March 1, and no update is available yet.  This program is UN-USABLE and I am very unhappy and would not recommend "as is" to anyone.  I have the 2005 edition and was very pleased with it.  This is a large embarrassment to the Hallmark company
I bought this software to print my Christmas cards and much to my dismay, it did not print properly on my HP inkjet printer. I tried various settings with the same bad results and finally had to contact tech support via email.  Here is the reply:"Thank you for contacting Hallmark Technical Support.We apologize for any difficulties that you may have had with our software.This is a newly found issue with the program.  The developers are currently working on an update that will correct this.  They said that the update should be out around Christmas.  Please routinely check for new updates by going to the Help menu and selecting the Check for Updates option.  When an update is available, you will be informed and it should automatically install the update."This is a "printing" software so when it does not print properly, it indicates that the software was not tested properly or simply the publisher expect the users to be beta-testers!  If some other features that did not work, it may be excused, but this bug is unexcusable! I am sure the software developers will have the software bugs fixed, but at the meantime don't be a beta-tester,  buy someting else. Humbug! 
I am a novice at web page creating and I am OVERLY glad I tried the free web trial (of course I lied about my address and my first born etc. that you MUST give to just get the so called "FREE" trial) this is the WORST web page editor for not so with it people.  It does not look anything even close to what frontpage had and again I am highly disappointed with it.  Where are the themes, web counters and the other simple to understand components ? I did try Namo Web Editor and for people like me, it is very good.  This may be wonderful for those of you who are very web page saavy but again if you are a novice don't get this or uprgrade to it, you will be HIGHLY disappointed
I hate to be rude but I have been building with FrontPage 2002 for years. It has so many templates and features but I thought it was time for an upgrade. I am thankful  that the original FrontPage is still running on my laptop or I don't think my latest sites would be up yet. Sorry, I don't mean to be mean. It may be like other programs that you can get training or have to take a class to do the things that FrontPages just does automatically. I'm sure it is fine as a stand alone creator software but to call it an upgrade, I don't know.
i pruchased the 3 computer product.  I installed and have been in email tag with norton support ever since. My computer will not shutdown after installation. They have no idea why.  I have been through the same protocols over and over again for over three weeks.  I was finally told that installing version 7.02 would fix it for sure.  I did and it did not.  I was also told that unlike other products such as webroot, when you buy a three ciomputer pack, then expiration date is tied to installation on the first computer. If the three computers do not have the same installation date-like mine -i had 2006 installed on three computers which were put on at different times-you can lose the value of the subscription.  When I called Norton customer service -i get the reply that what can you expect we gave you a bargain-about 70 on a three computer deal.  The service was rude and not helpful.  I asked why it did not say anthing on the box or in the manual and was told that was my proble,
WARNING!! This was the worst experience I ever have upgrading software from the same co. I have Norton Ghost, Partition Magic, and 06 Internet Security on my laptop. After instructed to remove 06 IS, I installed the 07 Antivirus. Afterward I kept getting a pop-up Runtime Error msg and the product will not work. I went to the support site and follow the instructions to use their Autofix tool to completely remove all of 06 IS and LiveUpdate. I did so and reinstalled the Antivirus. STILL GOT THE SAME @#$%^ ERROR! I went back to the support site and was told to remove the old IS and upgrade to a new LiveUpdate first. I did so and reinstalled Antivirus. STILL GOT THE SAME @#$%^ ERROR! I called support and waited 30 mins. Finally was told I needed to pay $29 fee for live help. I returned the product and vow to never buy from Symantec again. I purchased CA Internet Security and installed without any problem.
There is no excuse for Norton not advising of the incompatibility of this antivirus software with popular firewalls such as ZoneAlarm before installing the software, especially since previous versions have been compatible.  Once opened, returning the product can be a problem, perhaps that it what Norton is counting on
I've been a loyal Norton anti-virus  utilities software customer since the stone age, but like several other reviewers, I'm deeply disappointed that Norton Internet Security 2007 is incompatible with ZoneAlarm Pro, Sunbelt CounterSpy, and Microsoft AntiSpyware, and even more deeply disappointed that I had to crack the shrinkwap to find that out. Once upon a time, Norton  was the epitome of well-designed, thoughtful, customer-centric software, but they've degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a well-established name. I'll be returning Symantec's software if I can, and buying ZoneAlarm's A/V package instead
When I tried to upgrade from 2004 to 2005 I ran into a problem because I didn't have Flash 7.0 installed. Actually I had a later version of Flash (9.04) but of course Quickbooks couldn't handle that. Here's the fix: go to the Adobe site and download the uninstall program from them. Uninstall your flash player and then Quickbooks will then proceed. Good luck. Jo
I bought this software at the recommendation of my accountant.  Well, after trying to use it for two years now, I'm ready to burn it. It's a great software for people who do their business by the projects, but it's not good for retail sales.  Everything has been a hassel, especially trying to set up the daily sales so I can record detailed inventory of my daily sales.  Yes, I noticed they did come out w/a new version for specifically for retail sales.  After I already invested in $300 in software and $100 in books just trying to learn this system.  What a waste!
WHAT A BUNCH OF MONEY GRABBING IDIOTS!  IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING QUICKBOOKS, DON'T!!!!!!!  I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH A PRODUCT.  THEY TAKE FEATURES AWAY, ESPECIALLY WITH PAYROLL, IF YOU DO NOT BUY THEIR PRODUCTS.  THEN WHEN YOU CALL TO ASK WHAT IS GOING ON, THEY TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE NOT PURCHASED THEIR SUPPORT PROGRAM AND THAT THEY CANNOT HELP YOU!!  I HATE QUICK BOOKS.  THEIR IS NOTHING QUICK ABOUT IT AND THE SO CALLED SUPPORT STAFF ARE A BUNCH OF LIARS!!
I have never ever used an application that was totally designed to get more and more money.  Every other page is a sales page and after paying $300 plus for the application and another $200 for the payroll, now I have to pay if I want their help.  It is a good tool but the company mission is to make more money, no longer has anything to do with their customers.And this customer will not be one next year
Purchased this software because I got a deal with a special price break.  I have a very small business, so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly.  The set up took a lot longer than I had anticipated.The customer service was no help - couldn't answer my questions.  I ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right - another day wasted.I've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since I've spent the money, but I'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime.  If this is "Quick Books,"  I need to find "Lightning Fast" Books somewhere
I purchased quickbooks 2005; 4th upgrade in 10 years.Unlike earlier versions, this one is confusing and painful to use.Simple things like making deposits has to do through contraptions. One of the reasons I upraded was to use Online banking; it's a complete disaster. It doesn't download the complete trasaction details, reconcilliations are very difficult.You will be doing twice the work to use it.Once my transfer to the bank was aborted by a message saying you are low on memory and though Quickbooks sent the transaction to the bank, it didn't mark it internally, so on the next login, it sent the payment again!!! It has cost me $1509 of double payment that I am still trying to get back!How you pay a bill is totally messed up, There is no way for you to mark that a bill was paid online unless it was done through quickbooks online connection. (Bank's billpay can't be used!!)It's very poor in organization, you can't have 2 accounts #'s with  a vendor (still in 2005!!!).It has introduced obscure concepts as items and classes, which have no real definition and no "default" use and stop every transaction.One of the biggest thing Quickbooks has done to hurt their customers is the payroll. Technically you can do it yourself, but they hide that information and scare you in every step that you should (must) buy the $299/year payroll service (old tax-tables).In all the documenation, not once do they mention that you can do the payroll directly and this is how.Compared to the earlier products, this is a huge cost. By that reckoning I would have paid ~$2000 for the previous version of quickbooks!!It's definitely cheaper to buy a basic version of the software and use an accountant to do the other work and you will be better off. Don't waste money on Quicken services or premium products, they will bleed you to death on your way to a mental asylum
I'm still waiting.  Amazon says this item usually ships within 24 hours.  I ordered on Oct. 27; its now Nov. 8 and it still hasn't shipped.  Where is it
NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT THAT'S WORTH ANYTHING!  PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY! VERY USER UNFRIENDLY! OTHERWISE I WISH I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED IT! NEED SOMETHING THE AVERAGE COMPUTER NUT CAN USE EFFECTIVELY
What a terrible upgrade.  I'm going to uninstall it and go back to 6.  Even though I specifically told it to leave my file associations alone, it changed every one of them.  It's a nightmare.  I'm still trying to get Nero disassociated with certain file types, to no avail.  The backup program is awful, slow and much more difficult to use than the one built into 6.  Overall, Ultra 6 is a much better product.  I'm going to uninstall 7 and send it back to Nero with instructions on where they can associate it
The computer that I bought June 2006 came with Nero 6 OEM version.  It has worked very well.  I finally got around to clicking on the upgrade icon and ordered what I thought would be a serial number to unlock some features.  It turns out that is not available, and I have bought the Nero 7 Ultra version, which required a 195 MB download. Having dialup, I was not pleased.  I asked for my money back.  No response.  I faxed BBB complaint with copies to Nero offices in California and Germany. The office in Germany responded with email that they do not do refunds. Los Angeles BBB has been unresponsive. I finally got the download from a computer with broadband. I uninstalled Nero 6 and set restore point.  I installed Nero 7.  It worked!  But it was agonizingly slow.  I don't mean the CD or DVD writing per se was slow. When I eventually got it going that gave me the full speed of my hardware. However navigating from each click to response felt like it was in a 486 and not an Athlon 64.  I think other programs were also rendered more sluggish in opening files.I uninstalled Nero 7, and just to be safe I then used restore point from before I installed it. I reinstalled Nero 6. What a relief!  There may be some fancy features Nero 6 OEM lacks, but it's worth it to have the computer working at reasonable speed. If I want to rip a music track to a .wav file (a feature lacking in the OEM version), it's easier to reboot to linux and run K3b than put up with sluggish Nero 7 Ultra to do it.A product and company gone bad; Nero 7 is definitely not recommended
I'm in the midst of auditioning LCD panels and the local ISF certified guy wants $350 per panel to calibrate them. I like TV and everything, but there's just no way that I am going to spend $350 on TV that I might possibly keep. Still, the store settings on any two panels have two problems. First, they are amped up beyond compare as the TV vendors compete to be "who's the brightest" on the lit showroom floor. Sitting in my living room, they are far far too bright to watch. Second, they display colors totally differently. It's just hard to compare to 2 sets that are calibrated so differently.Now the TVs that we are looking at cost a pretty penny, and it seemed that a couple of hundred dollars to inform the decision was a good idea, just like the hundred dollars for an HDMI splitter seemed like a good idea. The splitter was a good idea, the Spyder TV Colormeter not so much.I calibrated 2 panels with this product. Two things are true about the calibrations. First, they do not look at all the same. The Sony panel has red shifted flesh tones while the Sharp looks cold and sterile. Second, they look way way worse than before the calibration. After 20 minutes of watching Casino Royale, it was time to revert back to a toned down version of the factory defaults for each.At first I thought that I had not followed the instructions right. Maybe it was not dark enough. Maybe the sensor was not positioned right. Having done the process several times, I can state categorically that while the colorvision Spyder TV may not deliver good results, it is consistent in its delivery of bad results. I simply cannot recommend this product
I have the same problem that Xrayman does.I was wondering if I had a faulty unit since it was an "opened" item and slightly discounted in the store where I bought it. I guess I'm not the only one who has this problem. My TV is a Plasma, for whatever that's worth. And I too found that the SpyderTV did not set things correctly. Color was much too saturated, and contrast and brightness were not correct. The only thing it did do was correctly choose the color temperature, which I do think is better than what I had it set to, so I'm now using SpyderTV's recommended color temp. But I reset everything else back to the settings I had already achieved by eye. I am going to try it out on an old CRT television and see if it works any better on that.My plasma isn't new, and I would recommend that people do not use this product on a new plasma.  It requires you to put a bright white square up on your screen for far too long.  I had to run through 15 color temperature settings, letting SpyderTV take a reading on each one, while leaving the bright square up.  Took at least 7 minutes.  That will temporarily burn the square into a new plasma screen.  ...and might throw off the remaining measurements that have to be taken
When I first received the product and installed it I had a few configuration issues (not unusual) but now, after 8 months of service, they are telling me I need to purchase an upgrade ($69.99) or I will have no virus protection.  I contacted Customer Service (what a misnomer) as no one was available to actually speak to me and the automated system was like one of those automated phone loops you enter when trying to contact any company.  I finally gave up and an now shopping for a newer and more reliable antivirus and protection system.  I did not get a full year of service, got jerked around and have lost all faith in this software package.  I wish any other users good luck
Great software! Until You have a question or a problem that is. Then You get the run around BIG TIME! ZoneAlarm says they didn't sell it to me so they can't help me. They send me to Broderbund for help. Broderbund then sends me to Encore for help and they won't help me either. ZoneAlarm states if I didn't buy it right from ZoneAlarm then they don't give any support.  It comes in a ZoneAlarm box, says ZoneAlarm on the CD but apparently it isn't ZoneAlarm??? (According to ZoneAlarm that is)!! Buy it elsewhere, or end up helpless!!!
I have used the Zonlabs Firewall for several years. It works fine. I can not say the same for the Security Suite. The AntiSpam function does not update definitions and ZoneLabs Tech Support know they have a problem. They are working on it but no date for a fix.Do not buy this software until all the bugs are fixed.
I do not have any recolection of purchasing this product, nor can I find it on my computer or in any of my hard non computer files. I have always ordered a hard disk back up of all purchases from Zone Alarm. There is no hard disk no Computer file. I am about to raise you Know what about this charge on my credit card. I will challenge it if I do not receive for what I am being charged. I will also ask My credit card Co. for a new number to prevent future charges from these folks. In the future I will use a third party encryted method for purchases on the internet.  rehadik@netscape  
I was reading the high reviews of Zonealarm so I went to their web site to get more information, and only about 2 pages of their entire web site would even show up. Makes me wonder how hard it will be to get tech support from them. Going back to Panda..
It's been 10 days since I registered with Zone Alarm and I still haven't received the license key. I wrote many emails and called customer service and I got no help or solution. Think twice before purchasing this product
I really like the Rosetta Stone product (although it is over priced).WARNING: Rosetta Stone (Fairfield Language Technologies) will NOT replace a CD if it is lost, stolen or damaged unless you bought the product DIRECTLY from them (and then they charge you $30 for a replacement CD).  I had the misfortune of purchasing from a local bookstore and someone had stolen the disk from inside the package.  In this case I can get my money back from the store I bought it from but since you can't backup the disks you had better be VERY careful to not lose one
Many repetitions are necessary in order to acquire a second language or a third, but the monotony of this program does not keep your interest for long, is so boring and offers not variety at all. This program will take away the excitement for learning another language even for the most motivated individuals, and will not help to acquire fluency because it does not equip you with the tools to construct language on your own. It does not contain essential grammar instruction, it is an error to suppose that the same grammatical rules of your language can be applied to other languages (French is not a translation of English, or Spanish, or any other language). Grammar becomes essential especially when you are trying to construct correct structures on your own; this program claims to help you learn "naturally" but leaves huge gaps by neglecting grammar, culture, conversational structures, and clear understanding, not natural!For adults translation is necessary when trying to internalize the concepts, adults already have an understanding of language and are equipped to learn differently than children, sometimes even faster. I do not believe that "learning a second language like a child" is an accurate statement to describe this program, children are immersed in the culture, everything around them is the "real deal", not repetitious pictures and recordings. Children receive verbal and non-verbal input constantly, and adults have greater cognition than children do. Looking at a picture while you listen a recoding might give you a vague idea of what it means, but there is not accuracy. It is very unlikely that you will internalize a concept that you do not fully understand. Rosetta Stone approach might be very effective when memorizing vocabulary and simple sentences, but I could achieve the same by purchasing flash cards for a fraction of the cost of this overrated, and overpriced program. 
I've used the past few versions of Acrobat and this one is a disappointment. Navigation is a pain. Instead of the familiar window and arrows at the bottom of a page Adobe's engineers have moved navigation to the top of the page and have only a single arrow.The whole look and feel is most unMac-like, more like a windows application. I suppose if I wanted to take the time and energy to study the user manual I would find the application friendlier but I don't expect to have to re-learn to use an application when I upgrade. If you're thinking of upgrading, my advice is don't
I purchased the standard edition of X3 primarily for 3 reasons: 1) It claims to have the ability to convert pdf files into WP format, 2) It claims to be able to organize your e-mail files through the use of WP Mail well beyond the capabilities of Outlook Express, and 3) It claims enhanced use of WP for word processing.What I found was a product that met only one out of three of its claims.  In baseball, batting .333 will put you into the Hall of Fame.  In business, fulfilling one of three claims will put you into bankruptcy!While the pdf converter is a rather good tool, WP3 Mail is unstable (and this is from their tech support department).  It destabilizes your use of e-mail to the point of making it virtually unusable in terms of reliability.  I imported older e-mail from outlook express when I installed the WP X3 software, only to later find out that the system crashed regularly.  I could not get at my older imported e-mail, and could not find a practical way to reverse the importing back into outlook express.  What really irked me was that their tech support was worthless in rectifying the situation.  They merely responded by saying they were aware of the problem and "may" release a patch to help sometime in the future.  Ahhhhh!As to the alleged improved "word processing power", I have experienced more bugs then appear in an Animal Planet Channel special on insects in the Amazon Jungle.  Unwanted page formating changes occur when I click my mouse on the page I had just finish reformatting. Undesired line spacing would appear on pages.  The list goes on, but who has the time to be more detailed. Do yourself a favor and avoid the product.  If you need to upgrade, check out the latest version of MS Word, you will be far more satisfied I'm sure
I upgraded from Wordperfect Office 12 to X3, but have returned the upgrade to Wordperfect.  The much touted ability to import PDF files is so poorly implemented that it is all but unusable.  In addition, the Wordperfect Mail component will not load data files while my antivirus (ZoneAlarm) is running in the background.  Corel Technical Support takes no responsibility for the incompatability.  Do not upgrade unless these issues are addressed
Generally like the program. Hoped it came with a CD to practice in the car but was wrong. It is totally PC based. I'll let you know in about three months if I can actually conduct business in Deutsch.
I can't for the life of me understand why Rosetta Stone has garnered such good reviews (although I see a few negative ones here, so I feel validated) and seems to have such an outstanding reputation. I find it practically worthless, and it's expensive to boot. I'm sure that my experience with the German program would apply to Rosetta Stone's other languages as well, as they all taught via the same method. I've been learning German for about 6 months and besides Rosetta Stone I have used Pimsleur, Rocket Languages, and have taken private instruction. Obviously, private instruction is best. But this review is about software, and Pimsleur is best. But Rosetta Stone has more bells  whistles, which is perhaps why people think it is so good. But it isn't. For example, nowhere in Rosetta Stone do you actually learn how to say useful things. Nowhere do you learn how to say "Hello," "How are you, "What's your name," or even "Where's the bathroom." Instead, you will learn how to recognize such useful phrases as "The woman and the boy have a ball on their heads" or "The man is under the donkey" or "These two fish are from the same species" or "The blue triangle is bigger than the red square." Ridiculous!! And note I said "learn how to recognize a phrase." This is the biggest weakness and disappointment with Rosetta Stone. It really doesn't get you to talk at ALL. You are not required to utter a word. You see four pictures, and the speaker will say (in German) "The boy is drinking milk." Now, if you have already heard the word for "boy" (Junge) and three of the pictures have no boys, you simply click on the picture with the boy and presto, you're correct! This multiple choice way of learning is not effective for learning a language! (There is a "practice speaking" mode, equally useless, which I mention below) With Pimsleur, which is an audio only program, you hear conversations that will impart essential words and phrases. And they are repeated (and asks you to repeat) in such a fashion that it sticks. For example, it was weeks ago that it introduced "How much do I owe you?" yet I still remember it. (Wie viel shulde ich Ihnen?--No, I didn't cheat and look it up!) Pimsleur is brilliant in the way it gradually builds your knowledge and abilities. Of course, it isn't perfect as it doesn't explain the grammar. But neither does Rosetta Stone, and Rosetta Stone is worse because with Pimsleur there is also an English speaker who explains some things, while with Rosetta Stone you are left to twist in the wind. That's why software language learning programs should be seen as supplements--supplements to classroom or private instruction. What are the bells  whistles on Rosetta Stone? You get to do a lesson in a variety of ways--seeing pictures with audio (the speaker), or pictures with audio and text, or audio only, for example. There is also a feature where the speaker on the program says a phrase, and you repeat it into a microphone and can compare your voice signature to the speaker's. But I found that this didn't work well at all and wasn't worth the trouble. And again, the phrases weren't useful
I have many (too many) Rosetta Stone softwares for language learning, however after purchasing "Tell Me More" software I will never go back to Rosetta Stone. It is true that you can learn a lot of vocabulary with Rosetta's program but that is about it! Rosetta's software is very illogical! Honestly, do not waste your time and money with this program, check Tell Me More and you will be amazed
I found this product to represent extremely poor value for money.  I purchased the product based on all the marketing hype and testimonials.  However, I have since come to the conclusion that these guys must pay people to write positive testimonials.This product only covers the basics (levels 1  2).  Then they try to rope you into paying even more money for their intermediate levels.I have since purchased a cheaper 'Tell Me More' package (for Spanish) and have been highly impressed with the scope of it.  They have packed so much more value into their package.  And it is a complete package - all the way to advanced level.I think it's really disgusting that Rosetta Stone get away with selling such a seriously inferior product at such a highly inflated price and people still buy it.  I think it borders on being a scam
I have been using this product now for almost a year. The only reason I insist using it is because I feel really bad for wasting my money. First, this is not worth $300 bucks.There are only still pictures and sound. No movies or any fancy graphics, so why the price? Second it is very repetitive and it does not advance in a very logical way so that you recognize the grammatical structures behind the ever changing sentences. Third, the sentences that you have to repeat over and over are not practical at all. You keep memorizing thins like "the boy is under the airplane" or "the ball is on the boy's head".Initially I thought, well this is because it progresses very slowly which is not necessarily bad. But then I took a look at the last lessons; you just keep repeating useless senteces like these without real things used on a dialogue. I cannot recommend you another course because I spent so much in this one that I do not want to try again and get disappointed. Don't be fooled by the wonderful reviews like I was. This is definitively NOT worth 300 dollars. It is not even useful for basic converstion. I have learned much more from simple travel books and cassettes from the library.Ah, and if you think that by repeating these structures alone you will understand german grammar ..
Being a PC user for many years (since 1985)I have come through all the versions of MS operating systems (does anyone out there remember 3.5!) MS has also piggy backed this "robust" office product for 20 years.  Their upgrades are seldom anything more than a better looking toolbar.  This is no exception, but this time I like the tool bar!  As to ease of use, I use PowerPoint and Word often and my spouse uses Excel.  If there were an easier product available we would buy it but then Windows XP would kill it on sight and Vista would stop working altogether.  Why does MS think that everyone but those working in a professional since (hence Office for Professionals) needs all the junk they subject us to?  Do those guys in Redmond still think adult users of the PC like "cute" things like little doggies wagging their tail or a friendly paper clip to help you answer your every question!  I am tired of Beta testing MS products for so many years but as a PC user I am stuck with them and until someone else can come up with a better system, other than Mac, we are all stuck with them. 
Office 2007 may seem ok at first.  The menus are all ok for me to use, so I don't have to build menus from scratch.  But after installing the trial, I found numerous complaints that would make me want to trash it if I had it.1)  Word doesn't want to integrate with Outlook very well2)  Everytime I want to send a mail message I accidentally click on 'Paste'3)  The flags and categories for Outlook are annoying and just add to the time spent administering email without helping me more than Outlook 20034)  Along with all of the other Microsoft products I've tried in the past month, it hangs, corrupts its own files, and generally takes up too much memory.I'll stick with Office 2003, which doesn't have nearly as many flaws.  There is no reason for me to upgrade.I'm also back to IE6, Money 2006, and will not upgrade to Vista.I've lost volumes of emails because I can't downgrade my Outlook files.Good Job in alienating your customers, Microsoft.  (so what's new?
Normally I might wait to install a new software upgrade, but I just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use Office 2007 with the new Vista operating system. I was wrong.You would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software. But after a month of using Office 2007, you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release. Microsoft should be ashamed.I don't know the root cause of my problems, but I have to stress that I am running a clean install of Office 2007 on Vista, so there shouldn't be any software conflicts or issues. So what are my issues? The list is long:-- My biggest concern is that MS Word constantly hangs and stalls. It can making editing a document very painful. I suspect the problem is when I put images or Visio diagrams into a document. But that is something the old MS Word was able to do without an issue. Oddly, if I have a colleague open the document and save it out in Word 2003, the problem goes away! What?! It's killing my productivity.-- When ever I cut and paste from an old document, Word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds. And often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire. I keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things. This never happened in the old Word. This is another time killer.-- Every few days, Outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders. Uh oh! I have to completely restart my computer to see my email again.-- Outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess. It is because Outlook 2007 does NOT render HTML correctly since it uses the Word engine, not Internet Explorer to display email. I have no idea why Microsoft did this, but they have got to fix it.-- Many of the issues in the old Word 2003 still haven't been fixed. If you place an image, it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly. Why can't they solve this one?-- While most Office programs have the new ribbon interface (which I like), some programs like Visio 2007 do not. So you have to remember how to use two interfaces. Couldn't Microsoft find the time and money to update ALL its programs? Give me a break.-- On a few occassions in Visio 2007, my files have failed to save correctly. At first I thought this must have been my fault, but it's happened to me a few times and can't be a coincidence. A few times I've gotten an error message and lost my work. Ug.-- Word and Excel 2007 use a completely new file format. So anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed (which isn't likely the case). To get around this, you can save it down to a 2003 file format, but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format. What a pain! Also, there definitely seems to be an issue with Office 2007 opening older Office 2003 files. Could be the cause of many of my problems, but there is no way I can avoid using old files. They should have worked harder on compatibility.There are good things about the new 2007. I do like the new interface design and the new features in Outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar.But I don't think it's fair that Microsoft released a product so full of serious, serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work. I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and don't think the public should have to suffer. Surely they can afford to do better!
Unfortunately, it seems once you have downloaded NAV 2007, your whole computer will not function properly. Internet Explorer malfunctions, and I also received a blue screen (fear of crash) stating that what ever program was recently installed, I should reinstall it. I did so, but the problems did not go away. I called Norton, they told me to run in safe mode without norton. My computer was back to normal, so it was Norton causing all the problems. I unistalled it and went with another product, after spending the $60 and many hours with Norton help desk. Don't believe me, do a search on any search engine, and you will see the many problems and no apparent solutions for this program!! Up till now, I have only used Norton, and never thought twice when buying the update. I'm now moving on to another product
I'm responsible for 10 computers at our organization. Last year we purchased Norton Antivirus 2006. It was such a resource hog that it stopped our older computers (550 Mhz) from working and I had to uninstall from all computers. After reading reviews that said 2007 was leaner, I tried to install this on 6 computers. Only 1 install went without problems. Installing on three other computers took 3 days, and I'm still not through with computer 5. Sometimes the program won't install. Once it crashes during install, it leaves behind broken code that prevents reinstall unless you use the Norton uninstall tool, which removes ALL Norton products. So in addition to uninstalling and reinstalling Antivirus, you also have to reinstall Norton Ghost or any other Norton products. On the computer I'm still fighting with the install went smoothly, but during the update the program hung up and now I can't open Norton Antivirus. Even worse, when I open a Word document, the Norton Antivirus starts scanning the document and freezes the computer.  What a nightmare
I did a little research after trying to install this product and found that Symantec is no longer rated very well for Anti Virus.  One site that states this is Consumer Reports (they are towards the bottom of the ratings).  It has become major bloatware and its stability isn't what it used to be.  Maybe this is why Peter Norton sold his interests and bailed out.  I am far from being a novice, but this thing gave me a fight the whole way.  So on with my saga.First, this product was supposed to be for Windows XP and 2000 Pro.  Even the box says this.  But when I insert the CD in a W2K Pro machine all I got was an error box showing the error icon and the OK button.  Real informative.  Going through the back door I try to install without going through the CD autostart program.  Now I get a box that says it requires XP 32 bit.  So that leaves out 2 of the machines I bought this for.So I go to a machine running XP.  First one loads OK, but it says it is incompatible with my firewall (ZoneAlarm) which I happen to trust a lot.  Then on the second machine it goes through the install (which takes 45 min) and then runs the autoupdate and hangs halfway through.  I finally had to abort it after it sat there an hour (I was hoping it was just another slow moment).  Rebooted and the program was no longer running.  Starting it up myself resulted in it failing to load.  Now I'm stuck, it won't allow me to uninstall nor reload it again.  Had to obtain a removal tool from their web site and it promptly removed every Symantec product on the machine.  Maybe this was the writing on the wall?By now I'm a couple days into the drama.  Meanwhile, the first XP machine that loaded fine did another automatic update and guess what.  It locked up half way through.  Now it will not run and had to be removed the same way.So I am now the proud owner of ZoneAlarm's Internet Suite.  It cost less than the NAV (both 5 user versions), and loaded much faster.  Ten minutes and I was done, where it was an hour into NAV when things worked and it loaded.  I am taking this up with Symantec and trying to get a refund.  They can keep it.  I've been less satisfied with every upgrade and this one finally broke the camel's back.  Maybe I'll try again someday if I come up with a new camel, but they don't grow well in Seattle.ADDED 3-12-2007:   I have also noted that after removing NAV that things I could not explain before have been cured.  For instance, the web site [...] would not load many of it's pages correctly, they would show the text coding instead of html.  Now that I am NAV free, all of the pages on this site load with no problems.  Hmmmm..
Norton is still the 800LB. Gorilla of Antivirus software, but I think more and more people are realizing that bigger does not mean better!  The old days when Peter Norton made an excellent antivirus program are long gone, and these days Norton is just a mass produced product of Symantec's.Customer service is through an Internet Database, and you must pay over $40 just to speak with someone even when Norton lets you down and lets a virus slip in.  The biggest problem is that this program is a huge hog of system resources.  It is no wonder that the ratings are so poor on Norton these days. I bought Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and have not looked back.  There product is less expensive and includes free phone support, and they have received all sorts of awards for their product
Quickbooks "sunsetted" my previous version, forcing me to buy this horriblle, buggy software.  It lacks many of the features that I liked from my previous version (2003), runs much slower, uses 10 times as much memory, and is full of bugs.  I regularly need to run Windows system restore when all of my company data disappears.  Avoid this product at all costs.  Time that I used to spend on more important business functions is now spent trying to get this crappy software to work.  I have used Quickbooks for 12 years, and 4 editions, but this will be my last Intuit product.  I wish I could give it 0 stars
I've tried to be a loyal Quickbooks Pro user for 5 years now and at first this company provided a competent accounting product that was decent after you learned its idiosyncracies. But each year you will be forced to update ($$$) or your tax tables will not be accurate, and each year some of the capabilities will be lost and you will have to pay for them to be restored ($$$), each year the program will be more expensive to update($$$). I am not an unreasonable business owner and I don't mind paying for good service, but Intuit has turned into a unethical, money grubbing monster. They sunset and disable your software every time you download an update,  forcing updates and buying previously provided services (payroll tax tables, e-mailing invoices, printing 1099 and W2). This is especially true at year end, becuase they know they have you in a tax/year end crunch. Now they are even doing unauthorised billing of new services (last year they started charging quarterly fees for tax tables--this year they charge a mandatoy $300 payroll update as well as a $100 software update for the program itself.) Furthermore they charge your credit card without permission under the ruberic that its the same as the quarterly tax table fee. Honestly, consider some other program! This deceptive practice of software disabling and data blocking, combined with the dubious practice of sunsetting software every year has grown intolerable. I hope they get the class action suit they deserve.
I regret having purchased this product.  I have not been able to use it for two months, after finally giving up trying to get it to work.  I have a very nice laptop running Windows XP Home, and encountered many problems.  I tried all of the avenues available to me through QuickBooks, online, via email, and on the telephone.  I spent nearly 25 hours overall trying to get the numerous issues taken care of.  Here are just a few:  The program would not convert my Quicken data; random script errors when you try to access help topics within the product; the phone # provided in the payroll demo is invalid; None of my info was viewable after bank download - it spontaneously failed to download my bank account info, after having successfully downloaded it for about two weeks.  I spent 2  1/2 hours on the phone trying to resolve just this one issue.  Part of the problem lies in the fact that I was unable to speak to a customer service person who's first language was English.  Each time I was on the phone, the customer service person seemed to continually ask me to re-describe the problem, then he/she would seem to be typing the info into the computer and waiting....then eventually telling me some solution to try, then eventually telling me they did not know what the problem was.  Not helpful in any way, though very polite. I'm sorry to say that this is a terribly designed, convoluted, over-complicated, non-user-friendly item which I would like to toss over a cliff. 
I have used a lot of software, but I do not remember using much that is as difficult to use or learn than Quickbooks.  I have learned it over time, but there seem to be several functions in it that could be done in fewer steps.  I would not upgrade unless I absolutely had to.  The program is usable, but I am not interested in investing a lot more money in it.  It works for my small business, but I could still probably get by with Quicken, as I do not write checks on it.  I do kind of wish I had stayed with Quicken.  The most annoying thing about the program was that I was going credit card data downloads in Quicken, but when I changed to Quickbooks, it would not let me download data from my Quicken credit card, it wanted me to switch to a Quickbooks credit card, or ask permission of all my credit card providers.  I appreciate the security, but since both programs are made by the same company, this just seemed like a scam
This is a great programme with Windows XP but be aware that it conflicts with Vista,the latest version of Windows. An upgrade is recommended by Nuance,the manufacturer to OmniPage at double the cost of Textbridge
I purchased this program with the intention of entering a bunch of typewritten pages into my computer.  The document that this program produced from newly typed material was so full of errors that I simply had to re-type.  It would have taken longer to correct than to re-type.  When I talked to Textbridge about these problems all they would tell me is that the program was not meant for such use and that I should buy one of their other programs which had good optical character recognition capabilities.  In other words, they know the product is not any good and they are not willing to stand behind it.  The program is useless for optical character recognition work or anything else
This product simply does not produce accurate results. It skips entire lines, words on the same line, and misreads even the most legible characters. It came bundled with my scanner, so at least I did not waste my money on it. Don't waste yours
I have been a faithful Mia fan for 5 years and have bought all the other games for my two kids. This game is a big disappointment. The language game is virtually unplayable in French. I am fluent in French and went to a French language university for nine years. I could barely understand what the characters were saying. If this program is intended to teach kids a second language, it would be more likely to turn them off the language instead. This game definitely does not cater to anyone who does not already have an understanding of French
I can't even comment on the actual System Works application because I never got it to run - it ruined my system right after install!  Once I installed it, it asked for a reboot, then came back wtih "Load Error!  Press a key to reboot..." which just lead to the error message again, and again, and again. A chat with tech support (after an hour wait) revealed that there are problems with the GoBack files, so I had to create a bootable CD, and do all kind of things which I haven't been able to do yet since my burner software doesn't have Image capability - necessary for creating this bootable cd.  Don't buy it, don't install it, don't use it - uninstall everything Norton/Symantec and never go back.  I'll be lucky if I ever get my computer working again.....Thanks Symantec!!!!
After over a year and a half including renewing for updates I've now discarded Norton SW 2006. it was problamatic and a waste of money. It conflicts with Partition magic another Symantec product and will not work with many MS updates. My system is now operating trouble free since I've uninstalled NSW. Previously my computer was eratic and crashed frquently
I have uninstalled SystemWorks 2006 and will not be going back to Symantec products. I had three problems:1. On initial install of SystemWorks in January 2006, the "GoBack" module wiped my hard drive. This was annoying and not easy to fix.2. I reinstalled (and had to reregister) without the GoBack module and used the software for several months satisfactorily. A few annoyances: CleanUp consistently (every night) deleted cookies and autofills I wanted to keep, so despite my entering them as exceptions in the options table, they kept disappearing.3. I wanted to move to a faster hard drive. After following the Norton Ghost directions explicitly (and getting a "successful" message, the cloned drive would not boot up. I therefore went back to my old drive. SystemWorks required me to reinstall (and reregister). In December, after renewing my SystemWorks subscription for $49.95, I successfully cloned the disk (using EZ Gig II). Again, the only software that did not work on boot up was SystemWorks. I called customer support and was told that the server would not allow me to install on more than 3 computers. I explained the circumstances but was told "there was nothing to be done," and that I would have to buy the software again. I chose not to.I have completely uninstalled the entire program and am now enjoying faster performance from the operating system and quicker boot times from Word, Photoshop, etc. The protections I was getting from SystemWorks are being covered by AVG AntiVirus (shareware), Registry Mechanic (shareware), SpyBot (shareware), and DiskKeeper ($30), and Microsoft's Malware Guard (free).I have been using Norton/Symantec products for over 15 years. Never again
Installed this on my laptop and desktop computers.  One installation was late in 2005, the other was in 2nd quarter of 2006.  Both have tried to fail.  The laptop will no longer do automatic updates.  I can manually download and install the updates, but it is a bit of a hassle.  The desktop will no longer download the Symantec updates at all.  I attempted several uninstalls and reinstalls, won't do it.  The only remedy is to take both computers to a computer shop and needlessly pay someone to fix the mess this junk software has made on both computers.  Because of the problems, I've run into several problems, mostly related to .cab files when I attempt downloads.  I've switched to AVG and Zone Alarm - both FREE and they work
I recently tried to update my Norton Systemworks.  Halfway through the update, I got a message telling me it was unable to uninstall my old Norton Systemworks.  I tried to back out of the installation at that point, but was unable.  I called the Norton company, spent an hour on the phone with a tech, only to have them tell me it was my computer.  I assured them that I was just using my computer, which was fine, and now it doesn't work.  They told me there was nothing further that they could do, and that I would have to call a computer service company.  I found out that the uninstall process corrupted my operating system, causing me to lose everything on my hard drive, and requiring a new operating system.  I have run into other people who had exactly the same problem, with no help from the Norton Company.  I will never again buy a Norton product.  I only wish I could get my money back from them.
I've been a loyal user of Systemworks (also "Utilities"  AntiVirus) for many years, frequently buying upgrades as I moved through various Windows OSs.  The latest verison (2006) has been a big disappointment.1) The "integrator" repeatedly crashes (and "must shut down").  I was told to reintall (it took 4 hours).  Tech support (email) was slow and barely intelligible.2) The full scan now takes over 8 hours on a modest sized system.3) The utilities have not been substantially improved in 5 years4) The rebate (for upgrade users) came in the form of a debit card, not a check.  (What a hassle!  I don't want any more "plastic"!)5) Turning the Norton protection off substantially speeds up my PC.  What the heck is going on back there?During the next year, I'll be looking for a new Anti-Virus support product.Cheers, Joh
I "upgraded" to NORTON'S 2006 Version of Internet Security and Virus Protection software online. Included was Norton SystemWorks. I have used Norton anti-viral software exclusively for several years without any major problems. And yes, I always remove my previous version, before adding new software. Even though my internet connection is via private satellite antenna, it took almost two hours for the product to download and install.  Then when I rebooted my laptop (a new high-end Sony Vaio with Windows XP), it froze up during startup. I won't go into all the hassle involved, but after THREE removals and downloads over a period of several weeks, it became apparent that there was something SERIOUSLY wrong with NORTON'S 2006 Product. It caused crashes on almost a daily basis, and updates always took an excessive amount of time. Customer service was no help at all, and the company refused to refund my purchase price. I've since switched to a different brand of anti-viral internet protection software and have had no more problems with my computer. After this experience, I will NEVER use NORTON products again. The only reason I gave this a 1-star rating is because it's the lowest rating available. It should actually be MINUS 5 STARS for the aggravation and time and money wasted
I've been a digital artist for 5 years and always loved and supported PaintShopPro and Corel products. I have to say I am very disappointed in the new version, PSPXI. No problems with the download, but the program crashes easily, you can not drag and drop as fast as in 9, basically is slower in everything you do. I am a photographer, and looked forward to the new photo features, which work, but for panoramas and complicated work others than one photo forget it. Just hangs up and so slow you could go have dinner in between.I have searched the net and support wise, the upgrades and patches have not helped. Corel is not solving the problem and maybe they can't. This is not a PC problem which they so want us to believe. I have plenty of memory and speed on my PC. It may be something involving how the XI stores it's cache. Not sure. But the changes are not workable, sadly.I think there are some corrupt files or driver problems that Corel desparately needs to fix and supply us with, or they will find themselves out of the PS market. This is not just me talking, it has happened to alot of loyal fans. Because it could be the better than Photoshop if they fix it.  If you really want the program, download the free trial first and or try the X or 9 version, especially if your PC is an older model.
I buy this dvd from Amazon and try to play it but my desktop can't read any data on the dvd, like it's blank. So I send it back for a replacement and it has the same problem. Both my desktops can't read any data on the dvd but my laptop can play it fine. Next I contact Git Corp and they say burning software can conflict with it so I uninstall Nero and it still wont work.Git Corp says they don't know what the problem is and passes it to their developers. I haven't heard back from them. All 3 comps run XP, 3 different dvd drives, don't know what's wrong! I have no problems playing the Avengers, Spiderman, or X-Men dvds
Picassa, part of the Google suite of programs, is both better than this program and free! What more do I need to add? The user interface of Picassa is easier to use and more responsive
Despite generally good experiences with Microsoft products, Windows Live OneCare seems to have resulted in very poor performance on a brand new Lenovo PC running Windows XP.  I removed it and performance has improved back to where it was, now running McAfee for virus scanning etc
Summary: I wasted a lot of time trying to make this work, and I eventually went back to other products.  In theory, integrating virus checker, firewall, spyware, and data backup into a unified suite (like MS Office with Word, Excel,  PowerPoint) makes sense.  However, this software package seems poorly made; it did not work very well for me.  Hardware, OS,  primary software used: 1.  Dell Lattitude D620 Laptop with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office2.  Dell X1 Laptop (thin/lightweight) with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office3.  Dell Dimension Desktop with 4 GB RAM, Windows XP, children's gamesPrior virus/spyware products: Lattitude  X1: NortonDimension: freeware provided by our ISPTheory:  Since Microsoft makes the OS  office applications that get infected with viruses, their product should be better integrated with the OS.  There will be synergy by integrating several related software applications.  Lesson: Well, after a series of terrible experiences, I hope others will benefit from my wasted time: 1.  Instead of loading most of the program from the CD  downloading small updates, this seems to load only a small part of the program and downloads huge files.  This made me feel that the product was shipped unfinished.  You had to do this separately for each machine since it hides the downloaded files then deletes them prior to finishing the installation.  This took a better part of an afternoon.  2.  I purchased a 3-pack license.  Installing and activating the software on the 2nd  3rd machines required a series of very annoying steps that involved logging into their website with broken links.  It finally required a phone call.  At least, the phone support experience was good. 3.  The product promises to minimize performance impact, and improve overall performance.  On the Lattitude  Dimension (powerful machines), there was no difference in performance, but we could notice a slightly slower performance with the X1.  This was later verified when we uninstalled the MS Windows OneCare and replaced it with another product.  4.  The product has difficulty updating.  It opens a small message box that asks you to click to update OneCare, but that takes you to a webpage that only works about 1 in 4 times.  5.  Except for the first time, data backup always has several errors that I have to manually fix.  This has very rarely happened with other data backup software I've used.  6.  Some applications, the firewall asks everytime for permission to connect to the Internet although the application is in the list to always allow this connection. 
This is a simple drawing program, much like Paint. Don't be mislead by the colored picture on the cover, it only does black and white. And it has no help in drawing Manga figures. And it is a stripped-down program, at that. The documentation is for the full program, so you can't do much of what you read in the manual and help files. Save your money, this program isn't worth buying
Before using ColorVision Spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free Adobe Gamma program installed as part of Adobe Photoshop. My monitor looked great and the photos I printed looked great too. The colors were spot on. After using Spyder2 Express my monitor looks worse. My monitor appears dim, the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull. If I had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor I wouldn't have wasted my time. My hope was that it would make my monitor look better, not worse. I am not at all satisfied with this product wouldn't recommend buying it. Instead try Adobe Gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online
I'm an amateur photographer and I use Photoshop CS2 for most of my digital editing.  I decided I needed a colorimeter based on the recommendations of many books that I have read on digital editing.  I had to download an update of the software program before I could start using my Spyder.  This procedure alone took several hours because I kept getting "error" messages.  I can't count how many times I unloaded and reloaded the program.  I was eventually able to run the program, however, every time I calibrated my one year old Emachine CRT monitor, it left me with an orange color cast on my screen.  I worked with ColorVision technical support for many frustrating hours.  The technical support person I was working with was very pleasant and really tried to help me.  They even mailed me a new sensor because they thought the first one was defective.  Unfortunately I was unable to get the orange color cast removed from my monitor.  After several weeks of trying to get the Spyder2 Express to calibrate my monitor, I gave up.  I just didn't want to spend any more time trying to get it to work so it was returned.  I really wanted it to work.  I'm back to using Adobe Gamma.    
I had some difficulty with the product loading the default profile, then the product asked later for a re-input of the serial number, which I no longer had.  No big deal, contact customer service, right?Contacted customer service via email once, got no response.  Sent a second email, and got a response asking a follow up question, since then nothing, no response, nada.  All follow ups ignored.Perhaps this product will work for you, but for me, it ultimately went into the trash because of Colorvision's refusal to respond.  Don't support this product, they won't support you
The product is so so, there are others that do the same thing for a bit less. But Colorvision thinks it owns the worlds so when it comes o support - you are screwed. Between putting you on hold for ever, not calling back etc.
Unlike versions up to No. 6, this version require authorization. This means that a single use version can't be loaded on multiple computers. Adobe informed me that this was not a bug and wanted me to buy multiple copies eventhough I am only using one computer at a time. This version forces you to take off the old legal version in order to install. When I found out that my legal version couldn't be used, it forced me to reinstall version 6, this took almost an hour to install, reboot, un-install and reinstall the orginal version. Why is Adobe the only company that forces this? Their program installation don't even skip from one set of four numbers to the next. They force you to type the dashes between the numbers. If you have multiple computers stay away from anything above version 6
Worked okay until I installed XP Service Pack 2.  Now I can no longer scan using my Brother MFC-9700 and Paperport 9.  It has been a long time since Service Pack 2 was released, and Scansoft has left everyone who bought Paperport 9 in the cold.  I could not care less if they now come up with software that is compatible with SP2.  This kind of treatment of customers makes it clear that they do not deserve our business.  Don't take my word for it.  Google the issue, and you'll find out that there are a lot of dissatisfied customers.  From now on, I'll avoid Scansoft
I was very excited to get this product.  It scans well, files well, is very sexy and promising.  Then I decided to Search for a few files based on my Keywords.  Oooops!  It won't search!!If you don't know already, PaperPort offers you only one free tech support call.  After that it's $20 a pop.  The rather surly technician I reached had me re-install my program.  Okay, but it still wouldn't search.  Then he told me to un-install Windows Service Pack 2.  Uh uh, no way.  Nada.  That's when I asked for a refund.I bought MyCab for $40.  Tech support is marvelous, within one hour over the Internet.  The only thing it doesn't do is scan within the program, but then I can do that, can't I?AKNapa, C
I have used both Paperport 8 and Paperport 9 Deluxe for over a year so I am qualified to report.Both pieces of software have some form of severe incompatibility with Windows XP Pro.  I cannot really get version 9 to operate.  Everytime I try its like cold molasses.  Click...wait....wait....wait...wait...and then lock up.I'm very experienced.  I've been working with PCs since 1991.  Every other piece of software I've loaded works very well...except for Paperport 8 and 9.In theory Paperport 9 should be fine because it converts all scans to PDF which is more or less a universal file format.  However theory is a lot better than reality.Support is nonexistent from ScanSoft.  If you pay the $19.95 per incident, you still do not get a solution.The ScanSoft forum is always either not working (another bad sign) or it's full of people complaining about the software and lack of support.Unfortunately there are not a lot of alternatives, but doQments looks promising.Avoid Paperport unless you have money and time to waste
I needed a document management system. After looking for software, there only appeared to be Paperport. I had read somewhere that the software becomes incredibly slow with a large number of files. I guessed a large number meant 2500+ at least.This concerned me, so I called pre-sales at ScanSoft, and asked if it was slow with a large number of files. He was not sure! So he told me to call technical. I called technical, and it his responses were very slow and sounded like he was reading them out to me. I asked if he was reading the ScanSoft website and he said yes, so I hung up. Obviously I read their site for an answer, and did not need to be paying international call charge for someone who seemed less knowledgeable than myself to read it.I got the software. Basically all the software consists of is windows explorer and scanning software. It worked well, and I thought OK, expensive for what it is, when Windows Explorer and scanning software (usually free) would nearly do most of it, but THEN after around 560 PDFs, it started running VERY slow.I thought it was my machine so installed it and the PDFs on a new Vaio 1.7Mhz, 1 gig laptop. Same problem. If you click to view the PDF then hit the return back, it takes 12 seconds! So if you view a document, it takes a good few seconds but then when you hit back to the Paperport Desktop to continue it takes 12 seconds!!! Completely unusuable!If you have less than 500 files, it is maybe expensive software, but for more than 500 do not waste you money. It runs so slow you can not use it. I wonder how ScanSoft get away with it - surely they should have tested it internally with thousands of files
I got my DVD a few weeks back and discovered I could not read any of the files form the 1990s. I tried on several computers I have in the house and came to realize that the DVD is defective. I contacted Gitcorp about the problem and they informed me they would send me a replacement disc. Problem is that after nearly four weeks there hasn't been any DVD and repeated attempts to contact Gitcorp has resulted in no reponses.Update, after continued emails to Gitcorp, I finally got a replacment DVD. They didn't even ask to see the original bad DVD. So my rating of this product would go up if I could. If you buy the product, check it closely, and get in touch with Gitcorp as soon as you find any problems. They can be very slow about responding
This is the stupidest game I ever saw for sale- my kids laughed at how poorly the graphics and story were. What a complete waste
The game is called Fritz and Chesster. Fritz is the boy. Chester is a rat. That girl you see in the picture, her name is Bianca. She never actually plays. She just says things like "Well done, brave knight!" and asks stupid questions. At one point poor Bianca points out that the queen is the strongest piece, and Fritz makes a comment about his mother chewing out his father. The tone and context are extremely anti-woman, in my opinion. He also counters by saying that boys are smarter. It seems like the makers of this game were really threatened by the fact that you have to call the most powerful piece "she". To take the queen down a notch, they refer to a group or queens as a harem. To demonstrate how this powerful piece moves they have the queen run around picking flowers as fast as she can. A male voice says, "Off you go," in a tone which one can only assume is meant to accompany a little pat on her behind.
I agree with reviewer Mr. Dietz.  I was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on Amazon for $24.99.  Put it in and loaded it in.  This game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all. No help menu either.  We wasted at least 2 hours on it before I ejected it and apologized to her.  There is nothing here to learn chess from
I was looking for an intructional CD to help my daughter to learn chess.  I read the reviews and endorsements and thought that this was what I was looking for.  WRONG!First of all, the CD comes with no instruction book and you're left to try and figure out what you're supposed to do by yourself (good luck). I've spent over 2 hours on this thing so far and I still haven't seen one thing that would help my daughter to learn to play chess.I've emailed their 'help line' hoping to get some answers and never heard back from them.Save your money and your sanity and don't buy this CD.
The product was easy to install but there was a trick I noticed.A day after installing the software I ran full scan. To try the sincerity of the software, I downloaded  same free trial. To my chagrin I was told my computer has about 420 problems and could only fix about 15.My question now is are all these gimmicks
I am a software tech. I first "free trial" V6 online-1. Finds 131 errors, but will only fix 4 (must buy full version!). SHEESH!2. Buy full version with 20% off coupon (3 computer lic, for only $9.95 more- their web site).3. Does NOT remove left/overs..., from old uninstalled pgms. (Fix-it Utilities "6" safely did- read my review).4. Then they only support updates... for 1 year- auto-renew! RIP-OFF!I got a refund, and will NEVER use them again
Be warned, this product does not support all advertised features on all phones.  Right out of the box I found it did not support 2 of our 4 cell phones.  Of the phones that it did support, the only sync features available were photo downloading and calendar sync.  The ability to transfer other data such as movies, contacts and ring tones were not available for my particular phone.  Without all of the advertised features are available I consider this a complete waste of money
it will not work in my Windows XP.  I have repeatedly asked for help;no one answers.  Finally, I was told to look it up on a databank.  If you have nothing but time on your hands maybe this is for you...but if you work for a living, you've been had by this company Encoreusa
After using TurboTax couple of years and then using TaxCut for last two years (2005 and 2006 returns) I concluded that TurboTax is much superior software. TaxCut's only advantage is that it is cheaper. If you take out price from the equation, TaxCut is inferior in quality.- In 2005 TaxCut software there was not PDF output of all the forms. This was pretty silly because after couple of years if I want to access my tax return I am not going to install TaxCut again in my computer and view by return. I would rather have have my tax return available in some widely acceptable format like PDF and then access/distribute whenever I want (I don't keep my documents in hardcopies). So I wrote to H Block. This year they added that saving return in PDF file feature available. But unfortunately, this is far from being perfect. It excludes number of important forms - example, IRS form 8853, California Adjustment Schedule 540CA etc. Instead of that it saves numbers of useless worksheet (without any data entered in those worksheets), same form multiple times.- Most annoying thing about this software is updating incorrect data. In one form I entered wrong data. While reviewing it I found a problem and went to that specific section to update. But in calculation TaxCut still showed old incorrect number. I just could not make it to use new corrected number. Eventually I had to restart a new return from scratch - just to have an dollar amount corrected.- In many section useful Helps are missing
We were big fans of TaxCut, especially after Turbo added spyware ..... THIS YEAR'S TAX CUT has irreguarities that are costing ($$) me ......... for example, you file your college student's return and check the box that she/he will be an exemption on the head-of-household return  then comes the surprise, head-of-household can't file their return with that college student as an exemption, despite checking the proper boxes! ....... for example, it can't caluculate railroad retirement benefits ..... for example, it tells you that your return is a-okay, you pay $15, then it tells you afterward that of the glitches and wants another $15 to refile! ........ good-bye Tax Cut!
H block does a much better job marketing software than writing it. I used the on-line version, had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later. After about an hour of painfully slow entry, sometimes just one item per page, most of the time looking at "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT" I had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save. No luck, repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error, and I could not save without registering. Finally just left the computer on and left; when I came back TaxCut had timed out and lost all my data. By the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e-mail to other companies. Even if you select NO you will get frequent e-mails from H Block. I will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year. When a company can't get something simple like this right, it calls into question everything they do
Two weeks ago I attempted to do my taxes on this software.  However, it couldn't complete the hybrid car tax credit portion so I could file.  I had two weeks until the update was available.  I downloaded it just now and entered the new questions regarding the hybrid and was told I had a credit of $3,100.  However, it never added this number to my total tax credits.  All customer support could come up with was "Start over from scratch, don't even import your information from last year's Taxcut".  Never again
Microsoft continues their legacy of software that doesn't work. I've been using Windows since the very beginning and 2000 professional and windows xp was about the only solid operating systems Microsoft has released. You would expect this so called upgrade to further improve upon this, instead it is many steps backwards. BTW, I have a 4400 AMD, 3 gigs of ram, and can say that Vista is SLOW SLOW SLOW. Be prepared for everything to run slower than it did on XP. Cool interface, about the only positive thing about Vista I have found so far. Searches are also much faster, but hardly a reason to upgrade. Be prepared for Windows Updates after installing Vista that actually cause once working drivers to stop working. I'm tempted to go back to XP, so needless to say a big waste of time and effort.
In short: too expensive, all eye-candy, no driver support from third parties, and the licensing model makes a re-install impossible without a telephone call to Microsoft to verify that you are not stealing their software!I upgraded my Dell desktop system from XP media center to Vista Ultimate to "fix" several problems I was having with XP. I found this to be a bad decision. I first installed the 64 bit version of Vista, but found that there are virtually zero third party companies that support 64bit Vista! No drivers, no working printers, USB devices, No internet security suites, etc! I then decided to upgrade to a larger hard drive. The Maxtor utility transfer utility did not work with Vista at all! It totally produced an unbootable system that the install CD could not fix. I then re-installed the 32 bit version of Vista Ultimate included in my upgrade box using the same license key. The on-line activation said that I already had this key in use and the only choices were 1) buy a new copy, 2) type in a different license key, 3) use the telephone to call Microsoft. I called Microsoft and found that their automated assistant could not help and was transferred to a person with a semi-strong accent who asked if this was the first installation and then asked if I was using it on the same machine (yes, it's the same machine). He then read a very long activation key to me that I had to type in. I find this totally unacceptable. the 32 bit version has better third party support, but it's not great yet. I'm using a lot of beta drivers that I had to search hard to find. The changes in the OS are mostly eye-candy from the end-user's perspective. I find the new licensing model and policies assume you are guilty first, and then makes you prove it. In doing so, Microsoft is burdening the bulk of their honest customers with a lot of effort to just make their software activate. Jack-booted policies like this will result in me buying from Apple next time. At least Apple treats me like the honest customer that I am!
I have thought well of every operating system since DOS 3.1.  This is without a doubt the worst system I have ever seen.  Not only is it NOT graphicaly intuitive, it is incompatible with most all of my 32 bit software.  Trying to use Quicken will crash the computer.  It is going to cost a bundle to upgrade all of a person's softwarein order to use Vista.  The only thing you will get out of running Vista is a lot of headaches
It's not because it's so slow that I hate it, it's because Microsoft has decided that I'm too stupid to know what I'm doing so they've decided to protect me from myself and won't allow me to even look at what's on my hard drive. Every mouse click now takes 3 or 4 clicks for the same thing. It's so confusing to look at my documents folders, I can't figure out what is where. I can't view web pages on my own site because they aren't in the security frame of safe. All my USB WiFi devices don't work on Vista and the only ones available are extremely expensive. My cousin bought a Vista installed laptop and with customer support couldn't get it connected to his WiFi router at home because of security issues, so he took it back and got one that has XP Media Center on it for less. I was given a full, licensed copy of Vista Ultimate and I will not install it on any of my computers. If MS stops supporting XP and I have only Vista available in a PC, I'll buy an Apple
VISTA is appropriated named.  VISTA defines something great to look at.  If all you did was look at Microsoft Vista it would be the perfect operating system indeed.  Unfortunately Vista is a computer operating system that was designed to be used and there is the problem.  Vista is so secure and so over burdened with layers upon burdensome processor power robbing layer of sheer garbage it is rendered totally completely and utterly useless.Vista will take the fastest XP computer and turn it into a slow worthless pile of trash.  Vista is so slow it takes me back to the days when I used to walk away from my IBM AT computer get a cup of coffee and walk around the building.  What makes Vista worse still is Microsoft Office 2007 the absolute pits in word processing.  Add Office 2007 to Vista and you won't be productive at all but dang won't it look pretty. If you just want to watch your computer make pretty colors and areo-glass catch yourself some goofs watch Vista.  When you want to work and be productive turn on your XP computer.  Windows 2000 and XP work hard while Vista Hardly Works at all.  Vista is garbage don't buy this dreck!Everything you try to do on Vista is not allowed.  Almost every peice of equipment you run on Vista needs to be updated to so called Vista friendly versions.  The messed up Windows explorer to the point to where it is beyond useless.  The problem with Vista is that Microsoft had taken all the wizards and helpful features far as they could in XP.  In Vista they had to try to top a operating system that pretty much did what you asked of it with little fuss.  In Vista the software code writers were just changing things because they could.  Vista makes nothing better or easier.  In fact Vista is built in a manner that almost seems to go out of its way to make even the most simple compater related tasks unpleasant needlessly long boring and tedious.In a word TEDIOUS IS THE BEST SINGLE WORD TO DESCRIBE MICROSOFT WINDOWS VISTA.  VISTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING THE ENTIRE COMPUTER EXPERIENCE IS PAINFULLY NEW LEVEL OF THE PURELY TEDIOUS THAT HAS NOT BEEN DREAMT OF BEFORE!  I just wish I could give Vista no stars or more honestly a negative star rating.  I won't be buying Vista for my current systems and even when I get a new computer I will not be using Vista is it comes pre installed.  I have my own old trusty XP disks and I will reinstalled XP the last useful usable operating system Microsoft made.XP is the goofy kiddie skool like interface is ugliest operating system Microsoft ever made but while it was an ugly duckling it did work pretty well.  Vista is by far the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever made but it is pretty and dumb.  Vista is over burdened with programmatic junk has a way to high opinion of itself.  Vista is so much more secure because all the dumb security features make the operating system unusable.  Any computer you make unusable is the most secure because you can't do any productive work on it.  Vista makes your computer experience endlessly tedious and makes your computer system a must see door stop.  The philosophy of Vista seems to be that a good computer should be seen but never productively used.  Vista is a great system for that  well monied executive that wants to look busy while doing nothing productive
i had a problem at the end of the process in that the program indicated no errors, but when you went to print the return, the message stated that there were errors on the return.  i contacted turbo tax directly, but they had no explanation.  they simply said that they had received a couple of calls about this problem.  that was it
Turbo Tax is fine. The linking into Quickbooks Pro (QBP) is limited to only the most recent 2 versions of QBP. So if you have an older version (older than 2005) you have to buy the new QBP to have Turbo Tax lift the data out of QB. Now Intuit will only sell a new version of 2007 - NO MORE UNGRADES. "For the consumer" they will tell you. BS, I will be changing accounting platforms as soon as I can find a replacement. This is the problem with software oligolopies! An Open Source replacement is much needed for both Tax prep and accounting.
Several years ago I used DeLorme's Street Atlas with a USB GPS receiver. The software worked but the interface was lousy. This year I tried Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2007 and was surprised to find that it has an interface that is smoother in some ways than the Delorme software, but still surprisingly clumsy. And the help is possibly the worst I have seen in a Microsoft product (that's saying a lot). Here are some of the problems:1. Street  Trips is expecting a GPS receiver that uses a **COM PORT**. Are you kidding me? In 2007??? The Delorme Earthmate 20 (usb) will work if you use the delorme com port emulation software, but why is this necessary??? (And it was not trivial to get it to work.)2. The handling of pushpins (identifying spots on the map), favorite places, and the like, is extremely clumsy. (Although, contrary to another review, you don't to re-enter the information each time. You just save the file and reload it.)3. Directions are sometimes not so great. Why would you instruct someone to "turn left" if you don't know which direction they're pointing (e.g., when you're stationary in a parking lot)? Much better in such cases to say "head NE" or some such. Freeway exits (at least in So. California) were often not handled well. (One freeway entrance was identified as a "local road", which at the time proved quite confusing.)4. Why doesn't the software automatically recalculate directions to put you "on-route" once you're off-route? You can push F3, but why is this necessary?5. I never got the voice providing driving guidance to work. The online help was useless. I'm sure someone can jump in and tell me how to do it, but it should be trivial.6. In general, the software has the feel of a bunch of modules written independently and thrown together. I'm not a reflexive anti-microsoft bigot (I bought this software after all), but I find that much MS software is bad precisely because it feels like it's cobbled together without much attention given to integration. It's shiny on the surface but the shine vanishes once you really start to use it.Given this experience, I will probably give the Delorme software another try next time around.
I've used MS Streets and Trips for years with minor problems.  This year I upgraded to a Windows Vista Laptop and wanted the latest software for it.  I have a GPS and I use a Pocket PC PDA so I need Pocket Streets.After I got home I read the fine print on the box.  It list support for no higher than the Windows XP OS.  But, so far the program is running fine on my Vista machine.The laptop has no serial COM ports and S 2007 won't detect a USB port. The description of S 2007 which includes a GPS indicates it uses a USB port but apparently it needs the included USB adaptor.  I could not locate where I could purchase such an adapter.S 2007 no longer ships with Pocket Streets.  Nor could I locate where I could download a copy.  I can (for now) use my old Pocket Streets program because 2007 does EXPORT Pocket Street maps.Finally, within two miles of my home the map list an airport and runway that was shut down in the early 90's.  The main highway a few blocks from me has only 3 exits in 2 miles yet S 2007 list over a dozen intersections which means when I get directions I always end up down a dead-end road.I've purchase many versions of Streets and Trips and this is the first time I felt I've wasted my money. Open software can't be returned from where I purchased it.  I guess I'll have to start researching other software packages.
This might be the greatest mapping program in existance, but I would never know. Very user unfriendly. There is no instruction book provided with it (or available that I can find.) The help function is very poor and doesn't provide adequate instructions. If you just need basic mapping functions save your money and use one of the free online websites
The benefits may be great, but the exercises are so boring that it is way too much effort to do them on a regular basis
Comment made by the user after about 30 minutes. Begged me never to make him use it again
I paid top dollar for PS7 and thought it was time to upgrade to CS2.  After I installed CS2 I discovered that I could not crop any photo without having my PC crash.  Every time it crashed I looked at the defrag utility and I had fragmented files all over the place.  Then I defraged the hard drive and went back to CS2 and tried to crop the same photo again.  Again, my PC hung up and was unresponsive and the defrag utility said I had to defrag.  The only thing I did was to crop one photo in CS2, and that was enough to make it necessary to defrag again.  I uninstalled this piece of garbage from my PC.  It does not work, and I don't care what Deke McClelland says and I don't believe what he says, either. Save your money.  These rip-off artists at Adobe are nothing but thieves.  Yeah, they ripped me off for $153 but you know what?  At least I have my integrity, and that's more than you got, Deke baby.  
The new  look is very nice.BUT, when you install, you have also to keep the previous version (in well behaved software, automatically the previous version is cleaned... not here).The system of validation of License through Internet for the physical machine is fine, I just hope that I will not have a disk crash and then waste time to be authorised to re-install a product that I rightfully paid (and at such a price).Well, make sure you:- do not try to de-install 5,5 after the install of CS2 (or bye-bye the license)- have a clean and robust backup of your installation....I am not sure I will make the next upgrade....
I should have ordered thru Amazon to avoid the confusion, since they state the vercsion needed, but where I ordered from did not mention the 5.5 version requirement, and on the box cover, THERE IS NO STIPULATION ABOUT THIS, only a generic statement that a previous version is required. How hard would it be for them to print on the box what versions will and will not work??????Adobe Customer Service would not budge, so I am returning the product. Of course, Christmas is ruined for the person I bought this for, and I am out shipping and handling charges. Thank you Adobe. Obviously, I can't recommend anyone buy from Adobe at this point. It's easy to see why warez are popular when companies are this foolish
Although it says that this works for ALL versions of Photoshop it does not upgrade from Photoshop Elements.  I spoke with customer service and they would not give me the code to unlock it
I purchased Turbo Tax after reading the reviews here...someone had mentioned a glitch, but someone else mentioned a work around.  Bottom line, if you can sit down with all your records and do the whole turbo tax from start to finish in one swoop,  you're fine.  But if you need to start and stop while completing the schedule 2 business aspects of your tax return, get ready for a huge problem...it doesn't let you back in!  I went to their website where they had both a work around, and a report that if you update your turbo tax (very easy) the glitch will be fixed.  Not so, it did nothing for me.  Then I tried the workarounds...I got back in once but the next time I tried to use the work around a few days later, it did not work.I ended up having to call an accountant 1 week before the 17th and thank goodness I was able to get an appointment.  Also, if you have a business and don't understand some of the tax workings, like depreciation, it is very difficult to translate your former accountant's previous year's work into the new turbotax. It's not set up that way, so you need to know what you're doing.  I have a college degree and a lot of stick-to-it-ness, but I could not figure out and be sure that I was entering things correctly.  And then, it didn't matter anyway, as I couldn't get in to change anything in the end.Finally, make sure you save, save, save as you go!  While doing my turbo tax and having spent a couple of hours already, I logged into their website to get some support.  When I "X"ed out of the internet page, it closed my turbotax screen that I'd opened on my computer.  Guess what?  It was all lost and I had to start from the beginning.  That was before I was even impacted by the "glitch" later.  This program does not remind you to save when you close, or ask you if you want to save, so be sure and save all the time!So, good luck to anyone who tries this.  For me, it was a huge disappointment and I am returning it to Amazon for a refund due to the glitch.  I honestly don't know how they can sell something with such an obvious problem.  
Turbotax is okay if you only have a 1040A to file, but anything beyond that it quickly becomes a real pain in the nether region.  Not only that, but if you have complications with trying to file, good luck.It looks as though I will have to pay to have my estate taxes filed.  Ttax is worthless
Everything the negative reviewers say is true and MORE. Please note the following as well:1. If you are a college student taking a class online that uses Blackboard software, Vista will prevent you from posting to the class discussion board and answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions on TESTS! To fix this download the FoxFire browser (free) and use it to access your course. Because Vista uses so much memory and is already so huge, they had to drop quite a few little programs that software needs to access in the Operating system.2. HUGE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE DRAIN. Look at this comparisonWindows XP Professional    Size on drive 1.5 gig    Memory requirements 128 MBWindows Vista    Needs 15 GIG To Load. Does not say how large the program is but I wouldn't think its small!!! Memory requirements 1 GIG!If you check the DELL website you will see that they recommend that you have 2 gig of memory to use Windows Vista. That is a few $$$ worth of memory just to run the operating system while openning a program. Try running a game or doing animation with that kind of a sink hole in your system! The less memory you have available, the slower everything, including websites will load (no matter how fast your internet connection)  What is worse is that to fix what is wrong with it (ie replace all those small programs your software expects to find in the operating system), they will have to ADD patches that can only make it bigger and hungrier for memory!This is the most pathetic excuse for an upgrade that I have ever seen. I would expect some lawsuits before this is over! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
I wanted a new computer, so a couple months ago I ordered an HP computer that happened to have Vista on it.  I thought, "oh great, I'll get the newest OS as well"... major mistake.1. Didn't work with my perhipherals, including my scanner and an HP PRINTER.  For god's sake, the COMPUTER'S AN HP, why won't it work with an HP printer!?  If they knew the drivers for perhipherals weren't ready, why the did they release the OS and force us to buy it?2. Annoying security feautres, constantly asking permissions to install software.  Just like the Apple ads-- a total joke.3. After struggling with the damn thing for 2 days, I decided to try to install old trusty xp on it... $200 later, guess what?  You CANT INSTALL an earlier operating system!  Booting from the CD doesn't work either, you get the blue screen of death.  Maybe some tech geek can do it, but I'm done wasting time with this thing.4. All that agony, for what?  The "fancy" interface?  Who cares what it looks like, I just want to use my damn scanner!  I'm sure all those slick effects suck up RAM and resources, for what functional purpose?  Just to look more like mac?5. ... Speaking of which, I am now switching to.  Goodbye windows, after 15 years of struggling with your crappy software, I'm done
My computer was running fine until I tried to upgrade.  First it took almost 2 hours to install at the last 3% it found a error and was going to roll back.  Well it never did.  It erased everything.  It went to a dos prompt. Called help line and it took 3 hours to just reload.  When it was done, I had no files or any of my programs on the hard drive.  Not only that but he said I had to install again to register.  It takes forever to install.  Took forever to get in touch with someone, they were in Nova Scotia, and I still do not have a working computer.  I have to try and get a recover program to get my files back.  I recommend staying away from this product for upgrades. 
You can bet those people gaving Vista a good rating here, work for the company.  It's a piece of JUNK.  If you have a good working XP, or anything else, please don't buy Vista.  I bought it a month ago already installed on a good HP computer.  I've worked on it from sun-up to sun-down for a month and still, all I've got is a pile of junk.  And, it's so slow, that you have to take a coffee break while it's gathering up a program to run.  Don't buy their One-Care either.  I've owned Windows since "98".  I'm considering re-installing my old HP/XP.  It's still here in the closet
This was horrible, I installed this and within a 24 hour period, I was slammed with pop-ups and SPAM....And good luck trying to remove it.  Very dissatisfied customer
I just bought this yesterday, and though the product description here on Amazon says it's compatible with Windows 98 and Windows ME, the packaging says "TaxCut USB Drive is compatible with Windows 2000 and Windows XP."  All our taxes for several years have been done on a Windows ME computer with a USB port.  Now what?  HELP!
I always thought the laborious interviews in turbotax were pretty ridiculous, now I've seen the opposite. Taxcut online seems totally not thorough, such as just asking for total of certain things, and not asking if special circumstances apply, which you don't miss at all until you have one of them. I had almost completely finished my taxes and got to the business use of home. I moved half way through the year. I couldn't find where to add an additional home office listing. "Nope, can't do it" said support after an hour long chat session of mostly waiting, "you'll have to use another product." So today I start from scratch and pay the $99 ransom that turbotax is charging small business owners. I encourage the competition to get their shizzle together next year.s:
The system requirements for this product on their packaging says nothing about Mac support and requires Windows.  H Block didn't support Mac's last year and they've only given half-hearted support this year.  If you own a Mac then TurboTax is your best bet. 
Unlike years past, H Block (founded by a guy named Bloch) decided to charge $16 for each e-file, Federal or state.  Only one version, "Premium Federal+State+E-file" includes a "free" Federal e-file and state e-file; but that version costs $70, so there's no free lunch at all.  Seriously, $16 is a lot to pay for e-filing.  There are websites that give you completely free e-filing; my favorite is TaxAct (at taxactonline dot com).  With TaxAct, you get the complete Federal plus state package for $7.95, which includes e-filing.  Or you can use their standard package to prepare Federal and e-file for free, with *NO* income restriction!I don't work for any of these companies, nor any tax-related company, nor any such entity.  I just don't think it's right for H Block to charge customers such a ridiculously high fee for e-filing, whereas people can e-file for free elsewhere.  BTW, if you use Taxcut to prepare your return, you'll have to use H Block's e-filing service if you want to e-file; you can't just take your file to another website and expect that website to do it for you.  I used TaxAct in the past and they are very dependable.  You can find reviews of TaxAct products in major magazines and on major websites.Good luck
I worked hard on a VCD project for work using Photo Explosion. I didn't think it was that easy to use, but it was okay until I got ready to burn.  Got a little error message that said something along the lines of "You don't have Nero burners!" No kidding, but there are four other burn programs on my computer. Nothing but Nero would do.  NOWHERE on the box are you informed of this.  It says, and I quote, "Burn CD slideshows you can watch on tv!" Needing more software is never mentioned. As far as I'm concerned, this product makes fraudulent claims.  I will never buy another one of their products
Very limited photo touch up. When it comes time to burn you might as well have customer service on the phone. Pretty much a total piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. They offer 30 day trial on this product, I wasn't happy and mailed it back to them in 5 days of purchase and I'm still waiting for the refund. I have called them 3 times, it has been almost 4 months now without a refund. I would never buy a Nova product from this company again and I would recomend everyone going somewhere else to get good customer service
This software messed up my computer big time.  It does something first of all, to Microsoft word.  Word does not work properly after installation of Photo Explosion.  It then went into different areas of my computer and screwed it up.  At first I only suspected it to be Photo Explosion.  I had to have my computer sent back to HP.  When I got it back I reinstalled Photo Explosion and the same thing happenend.  BE CAREFUL.  Product has BIG PROBLEMS - WHICH WILL GIVE YOU BIGGER PROBLEMS - I GUARANTEE IT.
The editing portion of the software is completly separate from the CD portion of the software and does not store in the same file. CD's can hold upto approx 500 photos but the softwware will not accept more and allow you to discard down to burn 500. I was told by Nova Development that the merging of photo shows was not being supported by the company since the CD writer was a free add on to the program. The box and program info did not indicate that. I offered to purchase the full program but it is not available anywhere
Lacks transitions between slides of digital pictures. Makes the slideshow somewhat flat. One good thing - can put music and also is quite fast in creating a VC
Once again, Microsoft has proven they can churn out some new schlock overnight, filled with bugs, with limited usefulness. The greeting card section was the most amusing to me- it prints out great looking cards with upside down text beginning at the bottom of the inside of the card. In short, the cards section is buggy and you can sink hours trying to maneuver around it and look for solutions online. I make pc cards all the time and I can say this program sucks. The help section answers nothing, but MS will gadly charge you $35 per question for support. Some huge sections of MS Works is just made up of links to internet sites that one can find easily by using any search engine; I call this fatuous redundancy. The loading for some parts, like the calendar, is slow even on a very powerful computer. This is one of the most useless and shoddy programs I have ever used in my ENTIRE life. It is a waste of space on my pc and will be used rarely if at all. It's hilarious they are charging around $50 for it. This is a $9.99 bargain bin kinda thing. Don't buy it. My pc came with it and that's the ONLY reason it's there.  
Having just paid [...] for this product, I expected the word processing component to have at least the basics.  Wrong. To me, the ability to easily format a business or legal document with "page x of y" at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental. Well, Works 8.5---unlike other Microsoft word processor versions or programs---does not provide that choice. Without this basic a "feature", you might as well simply use Wordpad. I cannot comment on other abilities this program has or doesn't have, or, on the spreadsheet or database modules, because I simply don't want to spend any more time on this. Recommendation:  Go to OpenOffice.org and get Open Office for FREE
TaxCut is easy to use but the explanations are not complete, nor written in a way that is easy for laypersons to understand.  Many terms of art are not defined at all.  Most disturbingly, when you first sign up for the product the price is listed at $54.95 for both state and federal filing,  but after you have already done all the work and are ready to file, the only options listed at checkout time are $29.95 for federal and another $29.95 charge for the state filing.  This bait-and-switch is apparently widespread and common for H Block, unfortunately.  I called and complained to customer service and they refunded me $5.  I told them that I thought it was certainly unethical and probably illegal, and they were inviting a lawsuit with this deceptive practice.  Finally, the program crashed several times while I was using it.   Although the data was always saved, it was quite obnoxious.  I run a high-performance, well-maintained Mac PowerBook, so I'm not accustomed to having things run so poorly.  next year I'll go with TurboTax.
I have used Taxcut and TurboTax on and off for years.  TurboTax tends to have less problems.  This year Taxcut was incredibly difficult.  First it would not properly import the data from DeductionPro.  Then the tier one tech support gave me outright incorrect information.  Finally tier two support gave me the link to the custom patch that allowed me to import the data.  Also,  when I received the Taxcut email that the IRS had accepted my return I logged on to Taxcut to check status and get my declaration control number.  Taxcut would not recognize that I had efiled and would not check for the dcn.  I had to call support for about the 5th time and after some time on the phone they discovered they could access the dcn and gave it to me over the phone.  Because of these delays I have still not finished with the state return.  I don't know if I will buy this product again. 
One thing you will find reading through many reviews is a dissatisfaction with the state filings. This is my own experience and this may be the last year I use TaxCut because of it. First of all, it would not allow me to e-file my state return but didn't explain why. I later discovered that for most states you apparently can't e-file a partial year return. Then when printing out the state return it told me I had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program. I later found out that Taxcut does not support all state tax forms! I then had to get that form and fill it in manually, and then discovered I owed less than before because Taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains. AND there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had.TaxCut also advised me I could save $1000 off my fed bill by contributing to an IRA. So I opened and IRA and contributed $4000. When I went back to TaxCut and entered the details it told me I wasn't eligible for any tax deduction. I was ready to be tied up! This software is seriously dysfunctional.I'm guessing by this stage you get the idea. Bottom line: I will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year.Oh, by the way, if like me you were unable to efile and you paid for the efile option, you can get a credit from H by calling 1-888-4TAXCUT option 2,2,0
I am by no means a computer idiot, I audit computer systems security for a living. I have had to contact customer support (webchat) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software. The install was on a brand new system (Windows XP Pro), with all of the Microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed. First Pest Patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an Active Protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes (which you had to click to clear each one). Second, the firewall would tell me I was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode. Third, Pest Patrol never would run a thorough scan. I'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the Pest Patrol GUI, or that system resources was not available. I contacted the customer support and they told me that yes, sometimes Pest Patrol doesn't work at all unless you use MSCONFIG to disable all startup services (systems.ini, etc) reboot, run Pest Patrol, then use MSCONFIG to enable the startup services. It was a canned reply during a live web session, which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people.I haven't tried out the third solution yet because I wanted to remind myself to write an Amazon review.If you are looking for simplicity, or don't know much about computers, look elsewhere. Otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds. I'll give it two stars, since it didn't cause my dog to choke, explode my house, or cause irreparable damage to clothing (which is my one-star). 
After installing this software in to My PC. Some functions of my keyboard stopped working. Even some multimedia buttons disappeared. After that I had to concatct HP to download drivers again.Even after installing the drivers, it did not start working as beore till I uninstalled this third rate software from my PC. After uninstalling every thing got fine. I will not recommand this soft ware to any one
The program crashed during Setup. When I finally got it installed, it crashed my machine every night until I uninstalled it.
Found the registration number difficult to read. Had to have customer service tell me that they run into this all the time! The I's look like 1's. Tried it again! I got it to load. My computer slowed down significantly! Certain sites I could not access anymore without re-configuring the software. I have used Norton. MCaffee or whatever, and other suite type security software. This one was the worst. I would not recommend it. I got a well deserved refund
I was lured to this product by a rebate which made it free. The manufacturer Computer Associates burned me for the rebate and will likely do it to you too. As for how it works no trouble installing like others have mentioned but it slows my computer to a crawl. After a while you will shut it down and then you can resume surfing the net at normal speed
I purchased this program for my personal and home business tax return but it did not include all the forms needed so I had to buy another version from them. H TaxCut included all I needed and was 1/2 the price
This was the most user unfriendly Turbotax I have ever used.  The Schedule C imported misinformation, had to keep forcing in the correct info. And I just found out my State taxes were received showing I owed a completely different amount than what I had electronically filed.  I have used this program for years, but after this, NEVER AGAIN!!! Let this be a warning to others
I used TurboTax Premier last year  was so happy with it that I told everyone to buy it this year.  What a fool I was.  This years program was a nightmare.  I will never purchase it again.  Every time I needed to go back to check something, I had to go backwards through each page until I reached the page I wanted.  Then to go forward to where you originally were, you had to retrace all your steps a second or third or fourth time.  It got to the point I quit going back to check.  It took hours this year and I am still not confident the results were correct.  I may take it to H Block just to see if I need to file an amend.  Next year I will try a different product.  ---One other thing, navigating the State portion was so difficult.  There were hidden pages in something called "quick zoom" or some such thing.  I could never figure out where I was.  Thanks for the headache Turbotax
I had the exact same experience as another reviewer. ....loved it for years...changed formats...no confidence. At the last minute I had to use an accountant. The accountant cost me $650.00. $50 more than what I was over paying in taxes using this software. A disaster. It doesn't look like it was importing data correctly, state navigation really was painful. I buy this software to try different senerios (Joint or single)...but this year it wouldn't do that. Probably because they worry too much about getting paid for every user and not enough to assist people who bought the software.To my mind the software is crippled
I have used Turbo Tax for at least past eight years and always have been very pleased with it. This year however some "genius" decided to change the entire format and approach and I found this year's version to be terrible. Very confusing now when used to be clear and simple. Hard to even download, confusing up dates, difficult to find numerous frequently used items (estimated taxes paid in previous year, capital gains/losses, state taxes paid, and more). The running total of taxes owed in upper left hand corner came out different from final taxes supposedly owed.    I have zero confidence in this year's program doing my taxes correctly so will have to have an accountant do return for first time in many years. Have recommended Turbo Tax to many over the years, but would strongly recommend against buying this year's product. A perfect example of how to take something good and make it lousy by messing with it. Suggest you save your money and either go to an accountant or use another firms software, this one stinks
I bought this product based on independent reviews by consumer and PC magazines.  The product's performance was OK, but customer service was a headache.  The serial number on the CD that was shipped to me came up as "invalid" when I tried to install the software.  I had to call customer service, who gave me two more serial numbers before the software would accept one as valid.  Now, one year later I want to upgrade my software to the current version (to save $$ over a new purchase) and guess what?  My serial number is invalid and in order to upgrade via the Trend site I will have to pay more than what Amazon would charge me for a brand new CD.  I will most likely switch to ZoneAlarm because of the hassles involved in registering and upgrading this product
If I could give less than 1 star for any Trend Micro product I would. It gives too many false positives when you don't even have a virus. You are going nuts trying to find where the virus is and there is not even one there as Trend told you there was. Avoid this like the plague and save your hard earned money. It's a piece of crap.
My subscription is expiring in a few days and this suite is impossible to renew.  They are trying to force you into 2006 security suite for the big bucks and buggy software.  2005 works fine until I have been thru the runaround 3 times with e-mail customer support.  I won't pay for their telephone customer support, trend micro will force me to buy another brand because of this.  Shame on you pcillin
When I click the "update components", I'm continually told that "the feature is still initializing, please try again later". This will happen even if I've had the program open for hours. I've contacted trend micro, followed their instructions for a workaround, but that still didn't help
So far we have been unable to use this product in the way we want to use it.  We contacted tech support, but after one call, we will be charged $19.95 for each call.  I have been disappointed in the product and the company
Very awesome program for adults and chidren,lots of information on the kids encarta.My son is in first grade and he needed to find some information on money from around the world he did it all himself
I'd be happy to write a review if I could ever get a working copy of this program. Three different computers and not one would the disc install on
This software only got one star because I couldnt give it a zero.  It never worked on my Windows XP computer.  I couldnt open the program, couldnt close it, couldnt get the sytem to shut down.  After a hard shutdown, Windows would not start.  Tech support couldnt figure out the problem.  I uninstalled Panda, reinstalled Norton and system is working fine.  I would not recommend
I bought this 1 week ago at a local Staples.. The box makes it sound like the solution to all your problems.. It also says they offer tech support 24 X 365.. Sounds great.... the problem is..it will not install on my computer. I keep getting a message to remove NORTON ANITVIRUS before I can install Panda. I removed NORTON and it no longer can be found thru control panel, remove software or thru a search of my hard drive.PANDA still will not install. I keep getting the same message. UNINSTALL NORTON.So I tried to contact tech support per the box. I found out they offer tech support 24 x 365 via email. I have sent 3 emails in a week and have received no response. Bottom line is I have a product I cannot use.. TECH SUPPORT does not exist. It deserves 0 stars in my book. Spend your money somewhere else
As a teacher I use Word, PowerPoint, and Publisher when working with students AND engaging in professional activities (presentations to organizations, etc.)  I have been using Office 2002, and thought I should upgrade.  BIG mistake.  The ribbons of icons are frustrating to scroll through, especially since I previously just customized the toolbar so everything I needed was immediately available.  I'm still trying to figure out how to type in Chinese, although the Spanish and German are working fine.  Additionally, they've come up with a truly ugly color scheme for their ribbons/icons/etc.  As a previous commenter noted, making changes to the basic template creates extreme problems, and I also was unable to get the darn number bullets to renumber.  It took me almost twice as long to write a test as usual, and I ended up doing manually what used to be done quite easily using the toolbar.The designs in Publisher are now very difficult to see and differentiate.  In previous versions, you could see the stark differences between different designs.  In the current options pages, everything is so soft, both in line and color, as well as being so small, that it's hard to tell what you're looking at.But the truly big disappointment is PowerPoint.  Their new selection of slide designs has all the appeal of rotting road kill--I would be embarrassed to give a presentation to a professional group using what is available in 2007.  I have reinstalled my 2002 programs.  I feel like I just wasted all the money I spent on this suite.  My suggestion?  If you absolutely have to have a PC because you do a lot of word processing, stick with Word 2002 or 2003.  If you need to do presentations/brochures/etc. for your business, get a Mac and avoid this problem altogether
They changed everything!  In an effort to make it more user friendly, they've rearranged most of the controls.  Menus are replaced by headings.  It is difficult to accomplish what were easy changes before.  Some of this will likely improve with use.WORD 2007 is constantly trying to think for you, auto formatting as you type.  However, it often isn't thinking what you are, and making it obey your commands is frustrated by the new headings.  Particularly frustrating, when I "right-click" on a list to restart numbering at "A" (ie. after roman numeral II on an outline), WORD 2007 flatly refuses.  My research paper is now formated:I.   Heading  A. subpoint  B. subpoint  C. subpoinII.  Heading  D. subpoint  E. subpoint  F. subpointIII.  Heading  G. subpoint etc....etc...This is ridiculous and inexcusable!  I also had to individually superscript 130+ footnotes.  Somehow, in changing the font from the Widows default "Calibri" back to "Time New Roman," the footnote setting was altered and I have yet to determine how to restore it.  However, if I open a new document it is fine, but I really don't want to retype a 30+ page research paper.POWERPOINT 2007 works well enough, compared to the older version.  They have added a few bell and whistles, but nothing that gets in the way.If you have to buy a new computer you're likely stuck with the new MS Office 2007.  But don't buy it until you have to.  It is NOT an upgrade from the previous two versions
This is the worst thing since the Office Assistant animated paper clip.  Forcing the "ribbon" on the user assumes that the user likes icons (I don't -- what's wrong with words??), and fills too much of the screen real estate.  Nothing is where it should be.  And what arrogance on the part of Microsoft to provide no alternate views, no "classic" view, just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons.  Another oppressive, giant waste of my time and money at the hands of Microsoft. 
I bought the software some months ago.  Noticed some problems with my PC in subsequent weeks. Didn't put 2 and 2 together.  Last week however, I'd come home - no icons on screen - no ability to Ctrl-Alt_Del - each day this would happen. The machine had to be powered on and off to reboot. Pulled recent software off machine. Yes - you've guessed - without Spy Sweeper I have no problems. OK - it might be a conflict with other software - a quick Google confirmed my suspicions that others have problems. I was never impressed that it was picking up anything of substance either - but then maybe my machine is clean
I made the mistake of buying a two-year subscription.  Every upgrade slows the product down.  A scan that used to take 14 minutes now takes over one hour. Stay away from this junk--there are much better free products available
I've been using SpySweeper for 2 years now.  It generally does what it is supposed to do.  However, it was nearing time for me to renew.  SpySweeper becomes a huge, irritating nag when it comes time to renew.  Not only does the software bug you all the time, but Webroot sends out reminder e-mails too.  With 3 weeks left on my subscription, I decided to renew, mostly just to get rid of all the nagging.  Well, guess what? - the renewal process reset my expiration date.  Rather than giving me 3 weeks plus 1 year, the renewal starts immediately, and ends in exactly 1 year - which means, that I've been ripped off for 3 weeks of paid subscription.  Maybe Webroot thinks their users are too stupid to notice this deceptive practice of moving up renewal dates.  I've complained to them - and if they don't make amends, then I cannot recommend this product to anyone
I work at Best Buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time.  For one its a huge system hog and two it doesn't catch much of the pesky spyware.  Also when computers come in to be cleaned up, no one uses this program (even though we're "supposed" to recommend it).  I would recommend xoft, pest patrol, or MS Antispyware much much more. 
I feel duped! I bought Spy Sweeper at the computer store a year ago. It was the 2.6 version. At first everything was great. I got my definitions, it found traces, it detected spy cookies. When I ran the definition update, I had no problem with the firewall. Every time they said upgrade, I did. Then I started getting renew e-mail. I had months to go and they sent me renewal e-mails sometimes two or three a week and I ignored them, not only because I knew the year wasn't up, but I also was suspicious that it was just another spammer out to get my credit card information. I e-mailed them asking if their renew mails were really from them, voicing my concerns. I got ignored, to when I eventually got to speak to someone, they didn't even know what their renewal e-mail looked like! The problems began when I updated the latest version which is the 4.5. When I would try to update my definitions I'd get a warning that there's was a problem and contact webroot, while it had no problem noting that I had the latest version updates. No settings were changed, not even my firewall which was blamed by them. I think it's them not me since now it's suddenly happening. They refuse to address it. Then I checked their site about my subscritpion. I knew I had one because I bought it at the store, my subscription doesn't expire until June and if I was invalid I doubt I could upgrade to newer versions. What did their page say? No subscription! When I wrote I never got a straight answer about it. Then I was told that the program was corrupted, download a new copy of the latest version from their site. I did. What did I get? Boxes that said subscription not activated. They knew I had one and they won't change it on their site or give me explanations. After pestering does my latest version now say when I expire. I've asked why it goes online to scan when it doesn't need to and I get ignored. So I decided to call but wasn't sure how because I'm in a different time zone. It took several days for them to get back to me by e-mail saying that their Mountain Time is treated like my Eastern time to get a hold of someone. The first person I spoke to after four tries at 15-20 rings each, was nasty, especially when I told him to slow down because he mumbled. I downloaded what he told me to do, he said nothing about the firewall issue despite him telling me he read my tickets about it.The second person sounded like he'd smoked one too many joints after he decided to answer the phone after 15 rings. He didn't know how to answer any of my firewall questions or why their page kept saying I had no subscription when the program in it's latest version finally admitted I'm current after pestering.  They don't give you straight e-mail answers. They don't answer their phones hoping that after the 15th ring you'll give up. It won't scan everything even when no other programs are running. In the new version it found a spy cookie, it kept repeating the same one over and over despite my checking it as "always remove".Never did that with the previous versions. I don't like a company who answers questions selectively. I don't like a company who makes you wait 20 rings. I don't like a company who blames your computer settings when they never affected the previous versions. Webroot's Spy Sweeper will be replaced in my desperate search to find a spyware program that actually works, and whose staff answers my questions and not mislead me about my subscription status
I have owned Spysweeper for several years. I have found that a large amount of spyware is not getting caught.  In many cases, a  **portion** of the spyware was caught, Spy Sweeper did not remove the complete spywhere and I kept getting hits.  Tried out XoftSpy software and it found and removed ALL of the spyware.Even more, I get constant e-mails from Webroot telling me that my "Subscription needs to be renewed."  and that I must send in another $25 to renew.  I got caught in their scam once until I started checking my subsciption date.  They frequently send out banket e-mails telling people their subscriptions are up even though they may have as much as a year left.  I have contacted them several times on this issue with no response or correction.I am only keeping this software installed because I paid out the bucks for it.  I would not recommend it to others mainly because of the decptive business practices and the inability to perform as advertized.  Look elswhere
This is a good product but...Unfortunately webrrot feels no need to stand by its current marketing claims of:Free Software UpdatesSpy Sweeper is continuously updated to provide you with the most advanced and effective spyware protection. As a Spy Sweeper customer, you receive these updates to our software absolutely FREE. This is simply not the case they have now instituted an anual subscription update fee like the big boys. When I addressed this with them on the phone they suggested I take it up with the vendor "Fry's Electronics" they should have warned you.Our issues are concern over the future marketing claims made by this manufacturer. They will also say you should have read the small print... We guess their interpritation of free and the rest of the world's is a little different. Who knows what they will decide in the future.We are seriously disappointed in webroot
The bottom line of what makes a company viable is great customer service after the sale when things don't go as planned. Customer Service exists but their reps claim they can't do anything about your problem. Their manners are less than acceptable. Rude seems to be the "in-thing" at this company. As consumers, we have options; one of which is to ge elsewhere. I am writing them off as a lost cause and taking my monetary loss as a lesson learned. It's too bad
I ordered ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2006 after a PC magazine review,   I have a 3 month old HP Media Center PC.   Th software totaly locked up my machine on install twice.   Each ocasion requireing me to reboot in safe mode and to use the restore function to even use my computer.   I lost 6 - 8 hours of work befoe I decided to return it.   I did receive my refund 8 to 10 weeks after returning the product.    I am now using Norton Internet Security with no problems.  I transfered it from an older abandoned PC.I mave been a PC user since 82 and am fairly knowledge about hardware and software.   This is one of the few programs I could not instal.   I have used the free Zone Alarm Firewall without problems.ew
Don't buy Zone Alarm if you use AOL; they are not compatable.  The pop-ups will drive you crazy and AOL won't work properly.  Also plan on your computer running much slower when this software is installed.  I bought it from Amazon and had to throw it away in a month...  no refund; money lost.  Norton is far better with AOL
THIS SCREENSAVER IS TERRIBLE. IT PAUSES AND JERKS AROUND. VERY ANNOYING. I EMAILED THE COMPANY AND NEVER HEARD FROM THEM. I DONT USE IT AND I DONT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY. THANK YO
I had two new fully operational G5 computers with Panther operating system already factory installed.  I was contacted by Apple that a new Operating system was available, faster, yada yada yada.I took the two computers into the store and purchased the new operating system Tiger.The software proceeded to completely destroy both hard drives on both computers.I returned them and told them I wanted my mony back. They refused since the software was oipened but agreed to replace the corrupted software and install it for free.The computers never worked right since.We were forced to continue working with these crippled computers as we have deadlines to meet.  It was a nightmareas it took four times the normal time to do the work because of crashes etc.  We were already out a week with down time due to their negligence.When the smoke cleared we took them back in and asked them to take the operating system Tiger out and replace the computers with the original operating system.  Another four hours standing in line.We got them back to the office and low and behold they still did not work. We took them back again and were told by a snotty tech that we had dust in the computer as if that's what the cause has been all along. He told us never to come in with dust in the computer again even though the dust was in areas that we are not allowed into without breaking the warranty.If this were the case why hasn't it been a problem for the past 12 years? and what am I supposed to do? only use the computer in an operating room?  The dust he displayed was extremely minimal the computer was only six months old and if it were such a problem why didn't the other four techs working on the computers notice it and clean it the first four times they had it on their bench?  Bottom line.. I'm tired of buying new programs and computers that don't work. Tired of standing in line for hours. Tired of companies not having a complaint line. How handy is that? No wonder they keep saying your the first one that's had a problem with this.  That's literally impossible since I work in the entertainment indusrty that deals with editing and service bureaus that operate 100s of computers.  They all are avoiding Tiger because of known problems as well.  Apple is not addressing this and hundreds if not thousands of businesses are losing valuble production time due to their negligence. Instead of trying to develope a way for my daughter to dock her I-pod to a bowling ball, they should concentrate on making operating systems work in their computers.Total time lost in our company is at least a week which is in dollars around 20,000.00. I can't imagine how much is being lost nation wide. Something needs to be done about this.  They need to be held accountable for the destruction they cause by distributing faulty product.To add salt to the wound they keep coming up with all these stupid ideas on why the computers are not running right after they destroyed them initially. There comes a time that if they can't fix them, they need to replace them and stop wasting the consumers time and costing them money.  We need a lemon law that applies to computers.  Then the manufacturers will make sure they function before they are sold. I know I can't get the money my business had lost back but I want them held accoutable for distribution of a faulty op and replace the computers they can't fix instead of sending me back to the office with inoperable computers
I've been using Apple's Macintosh systems since 1984 and have seen some great improvements in system stability, which I consider THE most important aspect of an OS.First off Tiger is a smooth running system (when it is smoothly running), and has some of the nicest bells and whistles around. The best dog-and-pony show around. That being said, WATCH OUT!This OS is capable of completely hosing your user settings, all your software registrations, bookmarks, email settings, etc. The whole enchilada. ANY OS that can do that at the drop of a dime isn't worth the time. Since I use Disk Warrior, Cocktail and Disk Utility regularly, this should never have happened. I waited until the OS was at the 10.4.3 stage before upgrading from 10.3.9 -- apparently it is not yet ready -- best to wait another year before upgrading. Hopefully these bugs will be fixed
It seems that all previous Quickbook versions will not run on Windows Vista and I had upgraded my system. So, I bought Simple Start as the least expensive way to get a Quickbook product to run on Vista. Turns out Simple start runs fine on Vista BUT you cannot load a company file from earlier versions. Thus, Simple Start was simply useless to me. When I called Intuit customer service they said that for another $100 they'd give me a license number that would unlock that feature. By that time I was committed and had no choice. Talk about getting ripped off!!
I read the review saying Simple Start didn't have enough features and would lead to upgrading to get a usable version. Despite the warning, I thought I could get away with Simple Start because I was buying the program for bookkeeping at a tiny church and would be putting few demands on the program. Even for my simple needs, it was a bust I had to upgrade to Pro for an additional $100. If Quicken isn't enough for your needs, get Pro.
If you are buying this product because it is the cheapest one Intuit offers, excpect to get what you pay for.  If your needs are really so simple that this product will work for you then you would be just as well off using a spreadsheet, or downloading the free version from Microsoft, or even using their home version with business added.  By the time you figure out that you need better capabilities it will be too late to return it.Bottom line, if you want a good Quickbooks bump up to the Pro version, so you can get real Customer and Vendor management, and a decent overview summary, and multiple category levels
Great Product but shame on Amazon for selling it without telling people that it is old software.  Kudos to Acronis for giving me a free upgrade to 10.Acronis 10 is absolutely wonderful
This item has not been received in 25 days! No help from vendo
I have spent the better part of 4 months dealing with these guys. They won't talk to you on the phone, don't let you get support until you register your product with a serial #, which, if you lose and need to re-install, you can't get without a login and a serial #. That makes no sense.I've had technical problems with True Image Home 9 and 10, and just can't get them to resolve it. Very unhappy with these guys. The product looks good, but if you have a glitch, prepare to wait A WEEK OR MORE for tech support to respond by email. Check out their web site and try some numbers - you'll find there's no way to talk to ANYONE unless you want to buy something.This is not one experience with them. It's Feb 07 now, and this charade began last August! Buyer beware
This is NOT the most recent version for this software.  Do an online search, check the manufacturer's web site and you'll find it cheaper for the latest version
If one is looking for an educational program to help a child learn there are much better programs on the market than Mia.Unfortunately we bought this as a package of Mia and all suffer from the same issues. First, it takes 2 CDs and a game cannot be completed without switching to the 2d CD. That compounds the problem that Mia cannot be loaded on the hard drive so the game cannot be played unless the CD is loaded. Having programs that require the loading of CDs to play them is a pain in the neck because children do not handle CDs properly and an adult must change the CDs. Most programs have only one CD but this one requires two.Mia programs are more like video games than educational software. They are comparable to video games like Spiderman and Sponge Bob which are puzzles to be solved. That is the problem with the Mia programs. The child spends an inordinate amount of time manuevering between the educational activities so that most of the time is spent manuevering and little time is spent on education. And it can be frustrating for the child, even a child that is very adept at video games. Yet because Mia is more of a video game than an educational resource, children who are video game geeks like Mia.Mia's science is better than Mia's Math and Reading because at least a written scenario is provided which helps out. But like all the Mia programs, the program hangs at times so that the child cannot complete the game. Worse yet because the program is always active, the hibernation and suspend operations on the computer do not function so the program must be shut down should the child leave the computer.Another problem that all the Mia programs suffer from is that the video only occupies a small part of the monitor screen so that the effects are dimished. Other educational software fill the full screen although to Mia's credit, when the user exits the program it restores the screen to its original resolution, something not all educational softwere does.The Mia programs do have humor in them which is enertaining to children and what educational material there is, is somewhat useful.The game is very lengthy. It takes hours to complete a mission. The oral instructions do not always match the written ones which are the correct ones, and are confusing to children. As the game progresses, lag time increases between segments
It only became clear to me how MS undermines Mac by using its software as weapon when I began using MS office for Mac. I have used Window's based Excel everyday at work for the last 20 years and I cannot figure out how to use the Mac version efficiently. It seems like an ersatz version from 15 years ago. If you want to work on PowerPoint docs at home created on your PC at work you will find the effort not worth it...the docs will never transfer formatting properly. I bought this program and almost never use it because it is just so clumsy compared to the PC version. Having said that, there is no alternative to MS office; this is the outcome of MS having monopoly power...no support and an inferior product for Mac user
It's not working with my Toshiba Tecra M2 laptop -- it keeps wanting an update to my video driver that doesn't exist
I've had dazzle products in the past. Usually a very good product, This DVD Recorder is just not very reliable. I would recommmend spending a little more and getting one of the higher end dazzle products
I found this software very difficult to use.  It does not have any "Stop" or "Go Back" button.  The only way to exit an activity is to hit "Esc" button to exit the program and then start all over.  When starting over, there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and I could not find a way to skip it
I bought two of the Mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed. class. I bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother (caregiver) passed away. The storyline of the game is that Mia has to SAVE her gravely ill grandmother. Then she gets MUGGED by a rat! I feel this is a little to noir for small children. The math game (which I am returning unopened) is about her house burning down, and if she could prevent it by going back through time. I feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects. I am returning both games
The creators of Mia's Reading Adventure would be better engaged creating movies and not children's games. There is just way too much expository and not enough interaction to make this worth your child's effort. If you're looking to teach your pre-k/k child reading skills I'd recommend the Blue's Clues games instead. Any older children would probably get as frustrated as mine did.
I've spent all day putting together a 300 page book in Corel Draw, the file was saved several times without error, the finished piece is 2.6 GB. I exported it as a PDF that is 4.5 GB. Never any errors in Corel Draw. Acrobat won't open the PDF. Says it's corrupted.Now when I open the CDR all I get is a single page, and when I right click on the file and look at the properties it says it's 0 pages.I'm really upset, and now I've wasted an entire day with COREL's software, if the thing is just for 1 or 2 page church brochures COREL should WARN people on the package.It looks like I'm SOL and I'm guessing Corel will never bother with a reply.Hint: I think I'll switch to Adobe.Sincerely,Waitman Gobbl
Aquazone is good, but I've found that Serene Scene is a better product. Aquazone is not as realistic as Serene Scene and that is what I was looking for. The realism of fish in an aquarium. If I could go back I would buy Serene Scene instead
I had to return this product. I have a newer G5 iMac with all OS X updates and as a program it worked. But if you buying this for a sreensaver, like I did, the product didn't work. I tried emailing and posted a question on Allume forum, got no response.
I purchased this item for $10 from Comp USA.  There was a problem with some of the files so when I finished installing it, my computer was a mess.I lost all my desk top icons and my computer was extremely slow to respond to anything else.  It took me a while to get the program removed and I eventually ended up doing a system restore.  When the screensaver came up it did look awesome.  I wish I could have used it but I am not going to try and install it again. 
In wandering around the web, I find I am not the only person to experience crash after crash upon importing (from Photoshop Elements 5).  When importing, Lightroom "thinks" for a long time (that's fine, and they do warn you it can be slow), but then the program crashes before it gets even close to finishing the import.About the rest of the program?  I don't know.  Too frustrated just trying to get it up and running.
This software does not come close to the once-upon-a =-time quality of Adobe products. it  is shot  full of bugs overall. Not only does it cause your Photoshop system to quit working, it affects your entire Mac operating System. Adobe knows this is true because they try to cover up with a several page discussion about how operating systems, not Lightroom, can cause problems. Their approach of blaming someone else is shameful. The design of the product is marginal; almost impossible to read the dark grey print on black backgrounds. It is slower than anything I have ever seen.  I could go on and on but it only raises my blood pressure . I have spent the entire weekend fixing the computer programs broken by this "half done" system.. If you buy it, you will waste a lot of time like I did. The software is going back to Amazon tomorrow morning. Amazon, shame on you for selling such a poor product.
I am rating this program just one star because I found out AFTER ordering that it is not compatible with digital voice recorders.  I did go to the nuance website before ordering.  They didn't have a little chart to tell what the difference was between preferred and standard.  Anyway, if you want naturally speaking to do transcribing, you need the Preferred version, not this one.
Dragon 9 is supposed to have Vista compatibility, via an update that you can get from Nuance. Unfortunately, the update does not work very well, especially in the area of commands. Imagine opening Outlook and giving Dragon the command for composing new mail or even checking mail, and watching it do nothing but move to another message in the inbox. Then, imagine going to the Nuance site to get support. You have to answer about a half-dozen questions and provide you key, even if you have a registered account that contains that key. Finally, you are told that support will cost you $9.95. Ten bucks to fix broken software?! It's no wonder they don't have a support forum; it would be filled with irate customers. I won't even go into the problems with getting the support person to comprehend the problem, except to say that the software did a better job of understanding me.I've moved on to using the voice recognition in Vista which, contrary to a popular YouTube video, actually works pretty well. At least when I need help, I can get it for free
I'm having a hard time understanding who would pay money for this downgrade?  You'll wish you had the "XP Upgrade" as soon as you do it.  It's just baffling that they would charge this much for such an awful product
not unless you are comfortable editing your registry to get your DVD/CD drive to work
I have a 3.2 ghz, 2 GB, PC, clearly ready for Vista.  After running the compatibility wizard and uninstalling all the software that would conflict (even the optional conflicts the second time around), they told me it would install, yet, it didn't.  After an hour of installing, it tells me the installation fails and restores XP.  I realise that mine is an isolated case, but it's typical Microsoft.  If you want something that works, buy a Mac
I can't get the software to scan past 30%.  The software locks up when I try to end the scan after being stuck at 30% scan
I've been running Spyware Doctor for 4 years, and was having problems with v4 using massive amounts of memory.  So I followed advice from the PC Tools homepage and loaded v5--BIG MISTAKE!  Since installing the new version and downloading the updates (a bad experience in itself, filled with ominous error messages from Windows), I've had to reload the code, reboot numerous times, had 2 Windows crashes and if the OnGuard facility is left running Spyware Doctor consumes 98% CPU for 5 minutes on every screen scroll done reading html text on a site identified as trusted. Oh and the company quietly changed it's policy and has hijacked my credit card information in order to automatically renew registration. I won't be running any more PC Tools products
In the instruction pamphlet under Scan Tools, there is a list of what the program scans.One of the functions is a Registry Scanner--"This is a fast scanner that analyzes the Windows Registry for traces of known malware."The bottom line--I have an infected registry which was discovered by my antivirus program and the Spyware Doctor doesn't know it's there. I do keep Spyware Doctor up to date.I'm still looking for an effective spyware application
Spyware Doctor was a fine malware detection product, but it is now broken. I've used various versions for quite a while (Windows 2000, Windows XP) but 5.0 is not working reliably. SD will not keep running on XP. The new 5.0 program unloads the OnGuard  Immunizer functions without warning on XP. The speed issue had been a problem (even with 1 GB RAM), but they seemed to have addressed that issue before 5.0.On Vista 5.0 will not uninstall. When you attempted to uninstall, it sends you to their website telling you how great the product is. When you ask tech support for help, they suggest uninstalling using safe mode (which cannot connect to their website). Spyware Doctor will not uninstall using (Windows Installer CleanUp utility - MSICUU2) as there is no entry. The Vista machine hangs and stalls. The obnoxious redirection to the PCtools website puts this product in the spyware category. Their tech support has been very slow (during the week, during business hours for a subscribed user with multiple purchased units). NEXT!
I have used Spyware Doctor since version 3 -- almost three years now.  I liked the interface and simplicity -- and the power.  But as others have pointed out, including industry reviews, version 4.x was a HUGE drain on system resources.  My PC's would take anywhere from 5-9 minutes to completely boot up, with Spyware Doctor using almost 100% CPU the whole time.  Also, my computers would frequently "freeze," which turned out to be Spyware Doctor randomly zooming to 95-100% CPU for no reason at all.But with version 5, things are so much worse.  About 3 weeks ago, my PC's lost their ability to connect to the Internet.  Browsing slowed to a crawl, with frequent timeouts and "server not found".  I spent days on the phone with my cable company, and my router's manufacturer, trying to troubleshoot.  I re-configured my entire home network over and over.  I never made the connection between the onset of problems and my updating to SD5.  It was only after finding the PCTools support forums that I realized the problem was Spyware Doctor.I removed the program from my PC's -- and the problems were gone.  I had full Internet connection and full speed again.Spyware Doctor 5 is causing massive problems for users.  PCTools rewrote the program from the ground up, the company says, to improve the resource drain caused by version 4.  But apparently it was rushed to market even though beta testers reported many of these same problems for weeks.I've uninstalled this software and am basically wasting my subscription and losing money.  Other users are right -- PCTools does indeed "auto-renew" and charge your credit card without warning.  This is a huge red flag.  I lost hours, DAYS, dealing with the problems caused by this program.  Many users have had to reinstall Windows completely.It's easy to get caught up in the hyperbole and negative reviews.  But don't just take these at face value -- read the Spyware Doctor forum at PCTools' website.  These problems are real.  And it doesn't look like they're going to be addressable anytime soon.  They've issued a couple of version updates, even removed several of the program's protection "Guards", but these haven't fixed the problems.  And they're not giving any kind of timeline or explanations to users.My advice -- stay away for now.  But keep up with the forums at PCTools' website.  When they finally get the issues resolved, this should be a really strong spyware program.* PCTools has also been criticized for offering a "Free spyware scan" on their website (actually a download of SD), which will find spyware on your system but refuse to remove it until you buy a subscription to Spyware Doctor.  This kind of sleazy bullying isn't normally characteristic of reputable companies -- most will give you an actual free trial with functioning software
I have been a fan of spyware doctore for some time. Spyware doctor 4.0 was an excellent product. It did it job pretty good without taking up any significant resource. But unfortunately it seems that PCTOOLS have not yet got their act together for Version 5.0. The first version I received as an upgrade was version 5.0 build 172. Problems started as soon as my machine rebooted. The Spyware doctor service for apparently no reasons hogged the system resource to an extent 95-97%. Killing that does not matter because the application restarts after 15 sec, and also that it seems to be the heart of the application. After reboot the update started running and BAM came the blue screen of death. So after a series of reboots and crashes I installed the version 5 build 176. But that too did not work, hence finally I reverted back to version 4.0 and eveythig works perfectly.Please stay away from Version 5.0 till PCTOOLS get their act together. As a reference do go through the review of CNET for this product[...]
 I usually use Adaware to scan my computer weekly, and like others, I would like to try the trial version Spyware Doctor to scan my computer. The result was, I had more than 200 infections! I was amazed that my other virus scan programs didn't catch any of these infections, and my computer had been running properly. Of coz, I would like to remove these infections and so I paid with my creditcard and got the License No. After entering the License No. and Scanning, I continued to remove the infections that spyware doctor had caught. Before clickinig the remove button,I checked what I would delete and the files SEEMS OK to be deleted.  I had to restart my computer in order to complete removing the infections. I clicked YES to restart.From then, my nightmare began, I couldn't start my computer AT ALL!!! Not even displaying the loggin window! My computer just kept restarting again and again.  After 5 times restarting automatically, I smelled something burning from my computer!!! I was so scared becoz there are some important files that i haven't backup yet! Endup, I reformat my computer!!! I couldn't login my old account again! Now, I have a new administrator account and lost all the softwares that i orginally have. Luckily I was able to reinstall 70% of the softwares (you gotta know the serial no. for most of the softwares are not working after reinstall, and that took me long time to find ways reinstalling them, and NOT all of them!) Some of my important files couldn't be opened again because I don't have the softwares to open them! I was/am still so mad about this! The spyware doctor removed my system operating files and that's why i couldn't restart my computer. Yet, i reinstalled spyware doctor again because I paid and only used it once. However, I couldn't use it after reinstalling like other softwares.  Even i followed the instruction online to reenter the licence no. that i purchased, it's just simply not working (the website said i don't have to repurchase and it should work!)So i Paid $10 , only used the spyware doctor once, but I lost all other softwares that cost totally more than $400
The new product release is worthless - too buggy and slow to work.  The previous releases were ok - they did find some malware and removed it, without interference in our system.  However, despite the cute-sy interface, there are other software programs that provide the same (or better) anti-malware support.Most importantly, this company has some shady business practices (like hidden yearly automatic renewal charges, installing google toolbar with download, etc) and no way to contact them directly other than their online contact form which never receives a response.  Check out the Better Business Bureau to see their "unsatisfactory" report.I am currently disputing a charge from this company on my debit card and have had huge problems - so far I have only been able to speak with Bridget at their third-party billing company who says they are not able to provide assistance with my complaint.  There are other, more reputable companies to work with.  This type of software is not worth the hassle
This is an example of a large company pertpetrating fraud on the people who buy its products. I bought my son an iPod for Christmas. Unfortunately he could not use it to download from itunes on his 4 yr old Mac Powerbook computer. He needed to buy the newer (tiger) operating system. So another [...] to buy this operating system. He has been unable to install it on his Powerbook.Both of us have spent over 4 hours on the phone with Mac tech support(hah!) and have found no solution.  Finally they told us to bring it in to an Applestore (three hour drive away) which we did, only to be told that it would cost [...] for them to even  look at it.I hope no one else has to suffer like we have just because you bought an iPod
There's a fundamental flaw in the software: it won't print a greeting card properly unless you have a borderless-capable printer.  If you print on a printer that can't do borderless printing, the front cover image on the card will be off center.  Check the FAQ section of the hallmarksoftware web site and they even admit as much.It's a known bug, and a 'fix' has been promised since December according to the hallmarksoftware on-line forums.  Until the fix is released, if ever, avoid this program
I loved the 2006 version of this software, but when I received an email offering an "upgrade" to the 2007 version, I decided to improve what I had.  I could not be more disappointed.  The resulting product is a miserable failure and I'm amazed that some people are having good luck with it.This version prints everything off center.  I can play with some of it to center it, but not the Hallmark logo, etc., on the back.  The result is a very unprofessional mess.  I went online to report the problem saw they have a FAQ on the issue promising that "soon" they will have a "fix" I can download.  Three months later and still no "fix".I've written Nova 3 times, they acknowledge the problem and issue the same automated response "Keep checking for updates".  Finally, after numerous emails and phone conversations they have agreed to let me return the software to them.When I received the 2007 edition, which in every other way was virtually identical to the 2006 version, I threw away my old software.  I'm now thinking of purchasing it again because I found this software easy to use and loved to be able to make so many changes, add photos, etc.Maybe some of these don't have this technical problem, but just be warned
Card Studio 2007 has repeated many cards from Card Studio 2006.  I bought this new program to have more of a selection but was very disappointed.  Also is is very difficult to see the cards when they are bunched.  You have to pick a card in order to read the front.  Very time consuming
I contacted the program's customer service department when the cards in this program printed off center no matter what I did. I received an email saying that this was a known problem with the program and a fix would be available by the end of January. Mid-February I asked again about it as there had been no fix. That time they said it would be fixed by the end of February. I've used their previous programs w/out problems, just wanted more variety so added this one. Apparently not a good idea.....
I bought this for my child who uses it at school and loves it. I have a Mac Pro running the latest version of Mac OS. I installed it and it needs to run on 800x600 resolution, which is kind of silly in this day-and-age, but that works OK. What does not work is that it crashes about every 5 minutes. Pretty unworkable. Don't bother buying this for a Mac
No support or response to questions, only 1/2 of the functions work, not a bad design but it was obviously released full of bugs.  Try cosmic blobs
We have Kid Pix 3 and my kids (4  6) played it all the time. We just "upgraded" to Kid Pix 4, and my initial experience has prompted me to write this warning.Kid Pix 4 runs in 800x600 resolution BUT it won't force your screen resolution to match that when it runs. Kid Pix 3, of course, did. As we are using a LCD monitor with native resolution of 1280 x 1024, we obviously want to keep the desktop running in this resolution. So now we are faced with 2 options: 1) Use Kid Pix 4 with a drastically reduced window (the drawing and toolbars are in a box surrounded by a huge black screen with the file menus at the very top) or 2) adjust the resolution manually every time someone wants to run or exit the program.I find this unacceptable. Customer support is non-existent: if you bought it retail, The Learning Company won't answer your questions and refers you to Encore's website. No patches are available and Encore has no way to actually contact them. Their FAQ simply explains how to go to your desktop and adjust your screen resolution to 800x600.I think this huge oversight and lack of any patch to simply fix the problem speaks volumes for the quality of this release.Boo to Encore, boo to TLC for allowing their "brand" to be junked, boo to Broderbund. Don't waste your time
This is the worst software I bought. First,it cost $100 and McAfee did not honor the $55 rebate because I sent the rebate form a little late. They had only 15 days to send out after purchase while compusa receipt has much longer deadline to send our rebate form. Isn't that kind of trick? Second and most important, it slowed down everything, not a bit but by dozens of seconds  or even more than 1 minute. Third,the speed is not only the problem, its wireless connection sucks to the maximum and a couple of my machines can't get online and can't connect to the network. I have 3 PCs and 1 laptop. Only two machine can get connected. It also conflicts with Belkin network card driver which has been so popular for so many years. How the hell McAfee did not know that adaptor?Fourth, there is no manual whattsover and you have to all figure that out yourself. Given it has so much problem it's very frustrating to configure it. Sometimes the security center is downloading forever. Who the hell knows what it is doing. Sucks. I had spent so much time to fine tune it and it still sucks that much. I changed back to Internet Security Suite which is much better than this. Don't buy it even they give it to you free or you will break the disk. 
 This software will not load properly no matter how you try. The online help is no help at all it gives you a few suggestions that all boil down to please try to re-install. Their down loadable wizard informed me after using it that I needed buy the components that didn't load but were on the disk. Try and remove the parts that do actually load and they do not uninstall properly. McAfee has a section devoted to removal of their software but so far all the suggestions have not worked. Need customer service and its $2.99 per minute from you're first call. I have never had such a horrid experience with a software from a "reputable" company in a long time. I will never buy McAfee products again.
 Downloaded the new McAfee software.  My computer is now slowed over 90% of the speed of a snail- both with AOL and Internet Explorer.  McAfee customer service is of no value whatever.  McAfee FAQ  describes a very dangerous fix which involves editing the registry file but even those instructions don't seem to work as described.     What a mistake
The software was installed on three computers and slowed two down so much I had to remove it on 2 and have not put it back on it worked fine on one of the thre
I bought this product because it combined a number of security elements.  It worked fine until I installed the network security feature.  We have a home network and as soon as I installed the product, the other computers were unable to access the internet.  When I tried to uninstall it, my computer lost internet access.  Even using the 26 digit key did not allow access.  Customer service was useless.  They gave me directions which involved changing the registry. Bad move.  Needless to say, I had to have a computer repair service fix the network, and I had to reformat my hard drive. McAfee assumed no responsibility for the problems it caused,  Dell was nice enought to walk me through the reformat and it wasnt even their product that caused the problems.  I would like to give this no stars
I bought this to upgrade my previous version of McAfee Total Protection. The first install was on a laptop, when it configured the wireless security it actually made changes to my WAP setup without notifying me. First of all it said that I didn't have any security set up on the wireless connection (although I have it set up with disabled SSID, MAC filtering, WPA protection...), and after it was done it had changed the setup to WEP... Also causing my other wireless PCs (that don't have McAfee) and my Xbox 360 to no longer connect to the network... So I ended up deinstalling that part. Second PC: regular desktop, after installing the software (only select pieces: antivirus, firewall, spamkiller, privacy service) my multimedia sharing to the Xbox 360 no longer worked. Contacting McAfee support never yielded any usable response ('reinstall' seems to be the default answer ...). Deinstalling/reinstalling didn't help, opening up the firewall didn't help, etc. etc. so I ended up reverting back to my old version of McAfee.I consider myself a power PC user, I've set up and configured dozens of PCs over the years, built my own PC, and I can honestly say that I have never used software worse than this one. I hardly ever write reviews, but I had to write this one. Be warned! Maybe McAfee will eventually get its act together, but for me it's time to move on.One last comment: this McAfee software (just like prior versions btw) takes up a lot of resources - several services need to run that take up a considerable amount of memory). Not good if you don't have ample memory
Until '07, if you had a McAfee suite but only wanted to use some of its components, and use other programs for other aspects of protection, that worked fine. For instance, I use Zone Alarm Pro for firewall and Spyware Doctor for spyware, and McAfee '06 just for virus. This combination has worked fine, but McAfee '07 won't install *any* of itself unless all other programs are removed. And that's a no-go for me, since some components of McAfee (esp spyware) weren't rated all that well by reviewers.
Contrary to the other review, they did ship the proper 3 user version. However, since installing it yesterday it is consuming 100% of my systems resources and I can not find any setting to have it stop. Evidently it does continuous deep virus scans so you might as well toss your computer in the garbage. What a mess of a product.
This has caused serious technical errors on my systems--all new laptops, desktops.  It will cause MS Word 2007 to crash and also cause a number of errors on your file system, possibly requiring you to re-install your Vista OS.Worked well in Windows XP and Office 2003 environment, and they claim this is Vista compatible, along with Paperport 11.  The company will not offer me a refund.  I will pursue.
Freezes IE 7 and you have to close out and restart...besides that, the other problem is slow printing because you have to use the "Print as Image" selection for anything that is scanned.  Overall it is OK, and with the vast price difference with Adobe, I can live with it.  BUT, make no mistake, this program is far inferior to the Adobe product
I deinstall the product after two weeks of use.  It did not allow me to select Adobe Reader as my default program and was not able to open many PDF documents.  If a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing.  Also, the feature to allow editing of the documents in Word or Excel was most often non-functional
I recently upgraded to MS VISTA and MS Office 2007 and I upgraded to the VISTA version of PDF Converter Pro 4.  BIG, BIG MISTAKE!!  The program installed some sort of pdf "add-in" to MS Office that caused Excel, Word, and Outlook to CRASH.  As soon as you opened one of the programs it would give an error message and close.  It took hours on the phone with Microsoft to figure out and correct the problem (THANKS MICROSOFT!).  However, I got ZERO help from Nuance, they wanted to charge me to even REPORT a problem!  BEAWARE YOU WILL NOT GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT WITH NUANCE PRODUCTS! Before I upgraded, I used PDF Converter Pro at home whereas at work I used Adobe Pro.  There is no comparison, PDF Converter Pro while considerably cheaper, does not do near as good a job of producing pdf files. I'm still looking for something that works but is cheaper than Adobe.  
I have purchased this product which I run on a Dual Core Processor under Windows XP Professional. Software is very unstable and crashes many times when I want to open a document from a URL. ScanSoft solution is that one should save the document in once PC and then open it up. This is of course unacceptable as this software should handle this and this is just a Band-Aid fix.Customer Service is the worst I have ever experienced and NUANCE/Scansoft need to greatly improve this. I have submitted on various occasions emails which I never ever receive a response. When talking to customer service they promise they would get back to you and so far have NEVER EVER done so!!!! Extremely unreliable service. I own many of their products and will NEVER EVER purchase another one of their products.
If you are accustomed to using other versions of CorelDraw, you may not want this version. Fact is, they have made many so-called "improvements" which I find are incompatible with other software that I have used in the past. It does not convert to encapsulated postscript (eps) files properly, and will crash programs that traditionally work well with eps figures. By contrast, CorelDraw 11 worked well. Hence the "improvement" has rendered the software a nuisance. If you are accustomed to pasting figures into other software, forget it. CorelDraw X3 will not retain the integrity of the original figure, and it will look distorted and crummy. Any prior version of CorelDraw worked well. Again, the "improvement" has made the software a nuisance. On top of that, it crashes a lot. I contacted their "customer service" about a year ago when I first discovered these differences. I was assured that they knew about the problems and were working on them. Well, a year later, with no patches to correct these differences, I am now being told that it is everyone else's fault (software manufacturers) that CorelDraw is not compatible. I was also told that they have no intention to correct these problems because they do not consider them problems. There is an example of their customer service for you. I have been using CorelDraw for a long time, starting with 6, then 9, then 11. This is the worst of the bunch by far. I am going back to a previous version.
I'm in awe about what this program can do, but I've yet to be able to use it to its fullest. It's not user friendly and I've been designing photo brochures, and marketing literature and multi-media presentations for years with other design software.The Corel_Tutor is unwieldy to use and only illustrates the simplest projects. It takes a week to learn the glossary used for the program. And if you don't use it daily, it's easy to forget the glossary and toolbox icons.I was hoping the "student  teacher" edition would be more instructive, but it's not.I'm currently searching for a tutor who will teach me the complexities of using this program with a hands-on approach
I used this software to do a scrapbook for my mother for her birthday. First of all the software takes up a HUGE amount of space! Like 1600MB. The program is so slow and I have a relatively new computer. After about 4 pages in one file it becomes impossible to work with and then crashes. I had two files - 6 pages - crash and the work was gone. All the work gone. The text editor will add typos and put in and take out spaces. Sometimes it works great other times you have to restart your computer. Once it added bright green lines where I had added all of the embellishments to the page - everything other than the background. I had to redo it. Piece of JUNK! but what does print on a color laser - don't try it with inkjet - looks great
Be careful with this program.  My wife bought it, and I tried to install it for her on our PC.  I made several attempts, and each time installation hung at a different stage of the installation procedure.  When installation hung, I could not cancel or kill it, or even shut down the PC without pressing the Reset button (on Windows XP Pro).I went to the support page of the web site, and found a FAQ item about incompatibility with Zone Alarm.  If you're not familiar with Zone Alarm, it is a personal firewall and security product that is very common among home users.  According to Nova Development, the only way to get Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 3.0 to install is to permanently remove Zone Alarm.  Besides being a serious security risk, this is an extreme measure to have to take.  This seems to be perfectly OK with Nova Development.  They offer no workaround other than removing Zone Alarm from the PC.  Personally, this would be enough to give me pause about installing the product even if I did not use Zone Alarm.  You have to wonder what the installer is trying to do that even the presence of dormant security software interferes with it.
This software was rated the best out of a large group of digital scrapbook programs. I am very disappointed with it. First of all, my system resources can't handle moving the pictures so while I click and drag, the screen doesn't keep up and I have no idea where the picture or item will end up. It's not very precise this way. The website's solution is to use my arrow keys. Ok, so maybe that's a problem with my computer. Second, I can't select photos easily because it brings up images that are too small to see the detail. And that's with the LARGE thumbnails. So in a photo of a group of 12 kids, I have to have the photo pre-selected. Not how I planned on putting together a scrapbook when I have thousands of photos to look through. Also, in researching the screen freeze issue I discovered that I can only have up to 10 pages in a scrapbook. Also not my part of my original plan. My advice would be to go to the designers website and look at the FAQ's before buying. It helps you to see any issues before you buy. I'm not sure what my next selection will be, but I don't see me using this for my scrapbooks.
I switched to Tax Cut years ago after Turbotax (in 2003) implemented their idiotic validation scheme. I figured I was doing my part to punish Intuit / Turbotax. And for all those years I've been happy with Tax Cut.Not this year. I found some major bugs which cost me a lot of time. I had my return done, but the numbers were seriously out of whack -- I know I didn't have that much income! Going back through the interview process didn't turn up the source of the added money. Only by checking the actual "Forms" did I find that several copies of 1099-Misc forms were hidden from the interview process, and by adding the same data in non-hidden copies, I was double entering the data. There was no easy way to recover. I eventually had to wipe the installation and start all over. A call to tech support did absolutely no good. The person on the other end didn't seem to understand the problem with having "hidden" copies of forms going into the calculations. If those are hidden, what else is it doing wrong? I'm not quite sure how do deal with this next year. Go back to Turbotax? Hope Tax Cut fixes its problems? Or go to a human tax preparer? Whatver my choice, I'm not looking forward to it.
I bought Taxcut this year because it was inexpensive and included business tax forms for my partnership. For the money I guess I'm satisfied with the partnership results, but that's where it ends.Taxcut for Federal taxes is not integrated with Taxcut for business... ok so what do you want for cheap. But, it also isn't well integrated with the Massachusetts state tax version, leaving me to go figure how to deal with what it calls "special" situations (unreimbursed partner expenses and interest from out of state banks, for example). Overriding form data is painful and the program complains that if I override calculated data I can not e-file (not that I would trust it to e-file my taxes). Form navigation is hopeless. I can only imagine what someone who isn't experienced with tax preparation could accomplish with this mess.I filed for an extension; now I'm probably going to buy Turbotax to do the actual federal and state returns.With a deep discount, I would probably purchase Taxcut again for the partnership taxes, because it is slightly easier to use than the Excel spreadsheets I'd been using (but only because I don't have to copy the numbers from the spreadsheets into the forms).Honestly, you would think there would be some tax software that is better than the non-functional Taxcut without the overblown, fatty and expensive too-many-talking-heads Turbotax alternative
I tried to use this program to file a very simple return, and it calculated that I owed the state $550 for underpayment, as well as a $230 penalty for late payment.I tried working through the program several times to find the error. I found that the program was automatically checking boxes that I hadn't checked! I have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem, which I was not able to resolve.In frustration, I went to [...] and filed my return easily within an hour, with a $140 return from the state rather than a $780 penalty
This program sucks. I used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing (i.e. unlike TurboTax and other programs, there's very little transparency in the system). Then I bought it again this year because the store that I went to was out of Turbotax, and I needed to get my taxes done quickly. This year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating, but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense.  The results for the federal return were OK, but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $2,000 in taxes that I did NOT owe on my state return. I ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap ($10) online service recommended by the NY state tax website. Within 45 minutes, I cleared the online source, and got results that made far more sense. I have no idea what happened with TaxCut, but I suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites. I will NOT be buying this product again
It is probably too late to save anyone from this software but I had to say something about it to someone. There is apparently no way to tell taxcut about it. I have been using taxcut for several years now after switching from turbotax because of the issue of them installing spyware. I was happy with taxcut until this year. It is defective. I can't even believe it isn't in the news. My taxcut program is missing the "wages" entry on the Schedule C form. It would have been a terrible loss if I had not caught it. I went to their website to get some help or a phone number and neither was available. I can't believe that I have the only taxcut software that is defective but I couldn't find any reference to this problem anywhere. Now I have to go through the whole tax form to make sure it didn't make any other mistakes! I might as well have done my taxes the old fashioned way by hand.
"Genius" is an educational simulation game, where you're building an industrial complex -- plop down factories, roads, houses, fire departments and such.  As the game progresses, you complete physics puzzles to obtain new technologies and product improvements.  You subscribe to newspapers, which contain answers to some questions and the knowledge or equations needed to solve others.  The physics problems are entertaining, well designed, well documented, implemented excellently, and can be quite fun.  They are presented as problems you encounter during business operation, for example while developing a new product.  All of the information you need is provided.  The game will appeal to children 8  up, but these physics problems are more like age 16  up because they require high school math.  So, children  youths may need help from a parent who remembers algebra and preferably physics -- yikes!  Some of the questions are easy  fun.  Some require you to be comfortable with algebra, converting between units, and applying formulae.  A few are very difficult.  Fortunately, the questions are the same each time, so after figuring out the answers, you can write them down  just enter the answers next time.  Sometimes the game even gives you the correct answer after it is too late, so you can write it down for next time.  Unfortunately, I can't find a cheat sheet list of answers on the web -- too bad, this would really help.  The level of difficulty of these questions isn't a problem, just be warned.The simulation side of the game is suffers in comparison.  The industrial simulation controls are poorly documented.  What each building does and when/why/where it is appropriate/inappropriate and how to run the game is somewhat of a mystery.  There's no way to figure out whether building something will be good or bad except trial and error -- logic doesn't always help.  Bad decisions spiral out of control, seem to lead inevitably to bankruptcy.  Unfortunately, wrong answers on the physics problems can have the same effect.  There is a "statistics" report that is supposed to give feedback on whether your company is making or loosing money, but this form doesn't have enough information.So, expect some trial  error, some frustration, some algebra, some physics,  some reading through magazines looking for obscure clues.  "Genius" can be really fun, but could use some interface improvements.  Highly recommended for anyone taking physics in high school or college.
OK, the maps are good, but its very very combersome to use with a laptop in your car. It is very disracting and can easily cause an accident. Does not work aroung Lincoln tunnel area. Also would not find my home street, and I have been there for 2 years. Either the one I got was defected, or its not what other make it out to be. I had to return mine.
This is a complete joke.  The only cities that are in the program for U.S. states are major metro areas. If you have a handheld (either regular or mobile phone) you more than likely also have WiFi or GPRS internet connection.  And if you are in a major metro area, with a WiFi connection, why would you need a program for maps?  Just go to Yahoo Maps or Mapquest.  If you don't have a WiFi, then just buy a paper map...it will do the same thing (maybe even more!) than this program.The only possible way this program could be useful is if you already have a handheld GPS receiver AND you never find yourself outside major metropolitan cities.  I have a GPS receiver for my laptop (USB) which I though could connect to my handheld and it won't...so my advice is to buy an entire package (software and handheld-specific GPS receiver).Can't believe Microsoft put its name on this junk
Doesn't tell you how to get anywhere when used with a GPS...simply shows you where you are.  Nothing more than a glorified paper map.  A complete embarassment
I purchased this program recently, and was very disappointed.  The maps are very limited...for example, most of the major tourist areas (beaches, Newport, ect.) in Rhode Island are cut out of the RI map.  I recommend buying MS Streets and Trips 2005 (which includes Pocket Streets 2005 in the box) instead:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002DOEAM/qid=1121691049/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-6971135-7476654?v=glance=pc=507846With this program, you have the entire USA at your disposal, and you can select which maps to send to your pocket pc or smartphone.Fortunatly, the store that sold me Pocket Streets allowed me to exchange it for Streets and Trips (after paying the difference).  The prices are very close.   
This product is nothing like the desktop version of the software. So limited in functions, you might as well have a paper map.
This app is just horrendous. It is literally NOTHING more than a moving map; I'm serious. There are NO features at all. To make things worse, when zoomed out, the display is littered with the names of every little village and hamlet you've never heard of, leaving the names of recognizable towns a cities nowhere to be found. Also, at these zoom levels, most roads, streets and highways are not visible, making navigation impossible. This app does not even come close to qualifying as a GPS nav system. Even as a 'moving map' it's pretty well useless unless you're zoomed into about 300 yards. Even though this app was a freebie included with Trips and Streets 2005 (which is a VERY nice, capable app.), it's still maddening that Microsoft would allow such a eggregiously lame program to be released. If it were possible to give this program negative stars AND charge Microsoft with a crime, I'd do it in a heartbeat
This is simply awful!  I would expect this type of performance from some no-name brand software purchased at a flea market - not from Microsoft!  I think they must of contracted this off to some really low bidder.  I had more satisfaction tossing the software into the trash than trying to auction it off on some internet site.    I think I'll go with the TomTom Navigator software instead
I guess i'm to dumb to purchase an item like this.  I followed the instructions to the letter and it's not working. I guess I should have read the small print.  Sent an e-mail to Xitel for help and waiting for response. Will re-rate later.  
while there are many benefits to learning vocabulary with this tool, I found it did not help with conversation.
I have been a loyal fan of Quicken for many years.  My, things have changed for the worst at the once mighty Intuit.  It pains me to report that Quicken Deluxe 2007 is a work in progress.1. The installation CD was unreadable.  To Intuit's credit, I was given access to their download site for replacement software.2. The reconciliation report (needed for balancing your checkbook) will not display or print for some reason.  All other reports display and print just fine.  Unfortunately, the reconciliation report is the only one I am truely interested in printing.  I am using a Brother HL-5280DW laser printer.  The printer works fine with all other programs, including the old version of Quicken.  Again, the most important report (reconciliation) will not print on Quicken Deluxe 2007.3.  The software would not recognize the C-drive as a working drive even though the program is running on that drive (?) - go figure.4.  The overseas Tech Support is willing to play dumb and pretend they don't know there is a problem with the software, keeping you in the chat room for hours.  I guess as long as they get paid it doesn't matter whether they help or not.  The ultimate recommendation is to reload the software - just one more time.As a past happy user of Quicken 2004, I was forced into this upgrade.Don't expect the problems to be resolved quickly.  Intuit has been aware of most of these problems for over 6 months.I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this version of quicken is just that BAD NEWS
I've been a user of quicken for at least ten years. I've liked the product historically, but this version is garbage. Like other users, I too have fallen victim to the 'out of memory' error. Guess what? There's nothing I can do. I can't go back to a previous version of Quicken, because my data file isn't compatable. Honestly, I blame myself for not reading the feedback others had left first. I was brand loyal to Intuit, but now I'm paying the price. The software is garbage, stay away.
Background - senior IT professional.  I have been a Quicken user for well over a decade and have always been very happy with the product until the 2007 version.  First, let me point out a couple of things to like about this version:- the interface; seems to depend on the eye of the beholder, but I for one find it pleasing and useful.- the ability to append notes and check images to a transaction.  I love this feature.- the Cash Flow dashboard and the CalendarNow for the caveat: if you depend a great deal on downloading transactions using WebConnect, prepare for a great deal of frustration and disappointment.  This feature used to work reliably in all other versions.  In version 2007 it is prone to quit with a notice that there has been a "Quicken Server Outage" that prevented the download from succeeding.  These occurrences are sporadic.Scores of users are reporting this on the support forums and elsewhere; I have seen no hint of a response or explanation from Intuit.  Horror stories about tech support at Intuit have kept me away from that venue, though at some point I'll call just to see what happens.  I upgraded to 2007 from a very solid and dependable Quicken 2006, and this issue alone has made me wish that I hadn't.Weighing the new features against the new bugs I would have to say that I do not recommend purchasing this version at this time
This is the first review I have written in probably a few years.  Normally, I don't feel strongly enough about any product, good or bad, to bother entering a review.  With this new version of Quicken, I have something that I feel strongly enough to write about.I have been using Quicken for close to 20 years.  I have built all of my finances around it.  For the past 6 years, Quicken has been going steadily downhill.  This latest version, I hope, represents rock bottom.  I don't see how the product could possibly get any worse.Words cannot describe how bad this product is.  No functionality has been added in the previous 6 years.  What has happened is that the screen has become more cluttered with more links to Quicken's "financial partners", and more redundant links to other, old, program features, and more white space.  In return, the user has to page through tab after tab after tab to view the same information that previously fit on only 1 screen.  Further, each screen refresh now takes seconds, whereas in older versions a screen refresh was instantaneous.Entering a simple transaction may require this bloated sofware to generate 2, 3, even 4 complete screen refreshes, each one taking maybe 1 to 2 seconds.  That means, once you hit the "enter" key to complete a transaction, you can be waiting as long as 8 seconds before you can move on to entering the next transaction.  As little as 3 years ago the same step required less than a second.  Obviously, time required will vary with your computer - but it is bad enough that Quicken now requires you to "downgrade" your Quicken software every few years - it is also necessary for you to replace your entire computer system at the same time just so you can realize the same performance level as you had in the previous version.  All of this with NO additional features or functionality.There is a new kid on the block that I am switching to.  It is called "Moneydance".  It can import data from Quicken, it is fast, compact, and runs on any platform, Windows, Linix, Unix, Mac, even OS/2.  It is easier to use than Quicken and the support is great.  It is available for download - a functional evaluation version is free and the full version is only $30.  You can actually speak to a person to get help w/out having to pay.  Since I have been using Quicken for years, it will take a while to test Mondeydance out to make sure it works properly.  I am running the 2 side-by-side for a while to make sure the numbers agree.  So far, things are going well.  Then I plan to dump Quicken forever.  The well has run dry at Quicken; everyone who made the product great has apparently left the company.Obviously the people at Quicken are free to make their product as bloated and as cumbersome as they want.  But they should not be allowed to force people to downgrade.  Yet, that is what they are doing.  I am absolutely positively through with Quicken, and I am not coming back
This is an extremely flawed software program. I have used Quicken for more than a decade, and this product is not worthy of the name. Runtime errors keep me from evening getting the program going. It contains 6 bank accounts which I cannot currently print checks from. I have reinstalled the software at least 15 times with no success. I have used every suggestion from tech support and the Quicken forums without ANY success. I guess I'll have to move to MS Money
It's definitely an awful piece of software. It's totally unstable under winxp sp2 and ie7. Follow other peoples advice and get quicken '06
Looks nice... but beware!Installed Norton 360 on the 6 workstations in our small office.  As soon as I did that our accounting system (Peachtree) started to lock up a few times a day.  Even after turing off the firewall on all workstations the accounting system still locked up.I've now uninstalled Norton 360 on the server PC and that seems to have solved the problem.I wish now that I had just upgraded from Norton Internet Security 2005 to 2007...  Never again.
Installed great - looked good. Day 3 it started blocking me from websites 'as their security certificate had been revoked' - Amazon even? After a week of back and forth 'support' they couldn't fix it and left me with a partially working PC to drown.  THe PC support is partially automated as they didn't read my responses and their advice went in circles.  Plus trying to fully uninstall it is a nightmare.It might work on XP but don't get it if you have Vista. 
Having had Norton products installed for years including AntiVirus, Internet Security, and SystemWorks, I decided to replace the installed products with Norton 360 and a non-Norton password manager.  Obviously, it is critical to FIRST remove all Norton programs before installing Norton 360.  The installation process proceeded relatively smoothly.My computing environment includes a 1.6Ghz processor, 1,000MB of memory, and 6GB of available disk.  The background scans and LiveUpdate have played havoc with my other applications by periodically locking up the entire CPU at 100% CPU utilization.  One application that streams radio broadcasts now stops.  I immediately disabled the automatic updates and scheduled backups, however, the CPU occasionally still locks.  Additionally, there is no way to transfer security settings from previous Norton products to Norton 360 thereby making the installation process very labor intensive.If you now have separate Norton security products and are satisfied with them, save your money and renew the Norton subscriptions.
As an IT professional I would strongly recommend against installing Norton 360 on your computer.  I have been a big fan of Norton Security for years and I have it installed on all my home computers for years.  After installing Norton 360, it erased most of my security settings and my computer continiusly crashed.  It messed up on of my home computers to the point that not only it would crash several times a day, but I couldn't even use System Restore to recover my computer and I was forced to rebuild the system from scratch.Don't believe the promise to install it easily on 3 computers either.  Symantec makes as difficult as possible for you to download the software and isntall it.I am ready to switch to McAfee
My subscription for 2006 was up and I needed to renew - since I just reinstalled Windows XP Professional (SP2) on my laptop (a Dell Inspiron 9300, Intel Pentium M 2GHz, 512MB RAM, 60GB Hard Disk), I decided to simply purchase the 360.I have been having issues with the Live Update for several weeks now (Error 5).  Instead I have to download a 15 MB file ever so often with the updated definitions.After checking the technical support website, it appears that Norton is aware of the problem and is currently working on it.  That was just about two weeks ago.  Customer support is non-existent it appears since I have yet to be contacted.Complete waste of time.  Renew your existing subscriptions instead.  I wish that I had
This version does not have voice prompts to tell you directions or some of the other features you might expect. Microsoft now provides voice messages in version 2006 and it is cheaper than this version ($59-79 depending upon timing). It is worth the price if you have a laptop. Pocket Streets is disappointing. By the way, it is illegal to have your laptop open in the front seat in some states so don't get a ticket (they allow a normal GPS but not a laptop serving as a GPS...go figure).  By the way, Microsoft does not give a discount to upgrade from version 2005 to 2006 so your only choice is to purchase a new product at full price
The video editing part of this software is completely useless.  It didn't come with a manual and I ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it.  It hasn't made a difference.  The software is completely uncooperative.  My computer more than meets the minimum requirements for running the program.  If you bought this software for the video editing, I recommend using the disc as a drinks coaster and buying something else
The features of the program are great, but it crashes WAY too much. My computer system is fully adequate for video editing, so that is not the problem. I've gotten to the point where I save my work literally every minute for fear that it will crash
The video-editing component of this package, Video Wave, worked great for me for about a year, but it has recently turned into a NIGHTMARE!  The audio is anywhere between 2 and 4 seconds out of sync with the video, and after trying everything I'm convinced that its a problem with the code.  A quick product search will show others who have had similar problems.  I would STAY AWAY
That's exactly where my CD went. In the garbage. That's where all the other Roxio software I've ever owned has ended up. At least I never had to spend extra for their junk.It's always came as  part of a peripheral or PC software package. No printed manuals are ever provided and it's always an issue trying to download one from the Roxio website...which I would then have to print at my expense.I could live with the on-screen manual if the software wasn't buggy and they provided some sort of customer support. I can't believe that this company is still in business. I guess that they survive by making deals with peripheral and PC manufacturers to stick their customers with inferior software.Be advised......don't be fooled by their slick packaging and website. Read the reviews here and elsewhere
The video editing capability is tough to deal with and not impressive when you figure it out. The tools are not explained and there isn't as much to do with it as they imply. May be nice for birthday party editing, i don't know. I didn't like it. It's not worth $100. The other capabilities might be nice,but from what i've dealt with, that's not the case
I was extremely disappointed in this "upgrade".  I had Roxio's Easy CD Creator 5 and loved it.  That product allowed you to easily arrange your music on the dics, burn it, then create a lable or insert for the disc with almost no effort.  Almost everything was intuitive.Creator 7 is a big step back in ease of use and utility.  So they added a few new bells and whistles, so what?  The base use of this product is to make music cd's and to create inserts.  Arranging music is not as easy as it was before.  And the insert creator is so frustrating to use I don't bother.In fact, I have continued to use Creator 5 and have simply written off the fact I paid $100 for Creator 7 - for nothing!Now, with a computer upgrade, Creator 5 no longer works.  I don't dare try another Roxio product (just read the reviews for 7.5 and that appears to be a total waste of money).  I'll be taking my chances on ANYTHING else . . . not Roxio
Once I figured this software out, I was able to do a slideshow of my pictures, integrate video, and produce a decent DVD.  Only problem is, it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4:3 whereas my DVD camcorder shoots in 16:9.  This sucks.  I have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16:9.  Roxio support did e-mail me back with the blanket statement that it doesn't support 16:9 at this time.  Even in the new 7.5 version.  Roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen
I foolishly purchased 7.0.  It worked ok for a few months then just kept hanging up my system.  Funny, it started hanging up when 7.5 was released.  I tried to get "customer support" but that's a joke.  Do yourself a favor, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ROXIO.  I'd given this software negative stars if I could.  Spend your money elsewhere. 
The game disk does not run on my laptop. But it will play it on my desktop computer.  Very annoying, but at least I can play (other reviewers have not been so lucky).The game has some good questions and I enjoy testing my Friends knowledge.  The game itself is rather simple and not totally fun.  The "game board" is the outside of the Friends' apartment building.  When you get a question right a window lights up.  When you get one wrong a window dims.  If you don't answer the question nothing happens.  You win when all the windows on that floor are lit up.  I would prefer that they make you answer all questions- none of this passing on a question- it would up the ante and perhaps add some excitement.If you play a multi-player game you cannot select which letter is your buzzer and the letters assigned by the game designers are adjacent keys on the keyboard!  It's silly for the two players to be huddled together, hovering over the same part of the keyboard when the designers could have selected other letter keys set further apart.There are SOME video clips and still images accompanying the questions, but it's mostly a trivia game without visual aids or embellishments.  Think Trivial Pursuit with a computer screen as the cards.This game was a gift.  If I had to do it over again I'd probably spend my money instead on Scene It! Friends Edition.  As of right now, Scene It! Friends Edition is on sale at Circuit City for the same price as this game is on Amazon. (And though I haven't played it, the reviews of that game are much better than this one).
This is an item that I purchased from Amazon.com that I am not satisfied with.  I cannot install the game on my computer to play it.  I had a relative try to install it on her computer and she also could not install it to play.  She believes that it could be a damaged disk, and that I should pursue getting a refund or replacing it with another copy.  I hope you can help me with this.  Thank you for your support.  Sharon Moseley
I am extremely unhappy with this product.  It is defective.  I gave it as a Christmas gift to my daughter and was very disappointed to learn that it does not work. 
     I read previous reviews about not being able to run the program because the computer recognized it as a copied disk. I thought this couldn't possibly happen on my high tech computer... I WAS WRONG... Even though I purchased a legitamate copy, the program still would not let me run it.... BUYER BEWARE!!!!!
I changed from quicken to Quickbooks and regret it.  Yes, Quick Books does some wonderful reports and invoiceing but I have found it difficut to use and especially to download crdit card transactions from my business credit cards.  I have also found it difficut to match transactions.   To get a better handle on my expenses I am going back to quicken or try another program.   Online help and tutorials, "dummies guide.... not helpful either.You would think see they make quicken they would allow import of QIF files.dissapointed. 
I have had to un-install and reinstall three times and it still won't update on a very current Windows XP version. I hate how hard it is to download from my bank and it never recognizes the stuff anyway so I have to go through line by line and create aliases. I like Quicken better but the accountant can't figure out how to import Quicken into his Quickbooks Pro so here it is. Hate it, hard as ever not easier, the whole thing takes way too long to work with. Reports are a bit easier which is good or I would have tossed it out the window and bought Microsoft Money
The product is great, calling tech support is a task though. Intuit outsources thier call centers overseas and it is difficult to communicate with thier support people by telephone. If this product wasn't preffered by my CPA I would never buy it ever again. Boycott companies that outsource to other countries, keep our jobs at home!
I was very happy with my QuickBooks Basics. But for whatever corporate reason they no longer support the Basics version, so I was forced to upgrade to Pro 2007. It is MUCH slower than Basics, it's more complicated to back-up (it asks SO MANY questions), also it takes longer to print a simple check (again TOO MANY CLICKS before it prints...
I'd give this product zero stars if I could.  I use the QuickBooks online payment service with version 2004, and last week it started telling me that they were discontinuing support for version 2004 with that online service, so they forced me to upgrade.So I bought the upgrade, and when I ran the installer it wouldn't accept my serial number.  I spent forty minutes on the phone with tech support on a choppy line to India, and he still couldn't get it to work.  I finally gave up when the next step he proposed was to disable all of the services running on my computer.I had heard from others, including an accountant, that this version was bad but couldn't believe it would really be this bad.  I'd used QB since the early-1990s and never really had a problem.  But this is really, really bad.Intuit needs to go back to the drawing board with this version.  It's a TOTAL LEMON
I installed quickbooks pro 2003 on my new computer running VISTA and had a small problem.  So, I bought an upgrade to 2007 since Intuit says it works with VISTA.  It does not.  The software crashes at odd times.  It also crashes when attempting to call up invoices from the accounts receivable report.  It reports out of memory errors and closes two to six times each day.  I have set up my old computer, which runs XP, so I can use the new software until they fix all of the glitches in the 2007 version.  I recommend NOT buying this version if you are running VISTA OS
I have gone through all the major revisions of PaperPort, and I dislike them all.  The features have improved, but the program has become steadily more unreliable and bug-prone.  It often crashes, which means I have to shut down the entire program when editing a document and restart, which apart from taking ages, loses all the changes I made.   Very frustrating.  It has also become steadily slower as the version numbers have climbed - you just to sit around twiddling your thumbs waiting for it to load a document or advance a page on a scanned document, especially if it contains many pages.  If you can find an alternative, don't buy it - unfortunately for me, I can's see any alternative if you want to manage scanned pdf files in a sophisticated way.Incidentally, this product seems living proof of the dangers of bloatware - it's pretty clear that the programmers have lost control of the software's innnards.Plus, by the way, support for this product is a scandal - $9.95 for each email sent?  Unbelievable
Contrary to the advertising about runs on vista, what comes in the box may not run on vista. Upgrade now says you are up to date but it is not., However, you can use product id to download the real vista version. BEWARE the product license says "The software...is provided on as as is basis without warranty of any kind..."I had a major mess with Nuance's product verification process. When the product did start to run, it was not correct. To date I've been charged for two support incidents(maybe more billing will hit my credit card later) and I've logged 3 hours on the phone within the first two weeks as well as several emails. Otherwise I like the product but one should not have to have hours of grief and pay and pay to get it running the first time. I'll never by another nuance product.
No Support. You have to pay $9.95 to send an email support question. Still cannot print annotations in PDF files that you create. There is a workaround. Nuance should change their name to Nuisance. I hope that someone comes up with an alternative
I have been using Paperport since it came from my visioneer scanner for about 9/10 years and since then upgraded a few versions. After reading hyped-up product features of version 11 from Nuance website, I cannot justify upgrading my paperport software to PRO given its  current cost. I am pretty sure that a lot more people (especially loyal users like me) would snap it up if it was little cheaper. I will probably wait for some time for price to go down.... It will also need time to stabilize ( no patches yet !!!) and become compatible with Vista. For those of you who got lotsa money (please send me some), I would recommend Paperport as a decent doc managment s/w
I have been a user of PaperPort since version 9, skipped the upgrade to 10 because of bad reviews, received an upgrade notice in the mail, so I decided to buy it. It turns out it was a bad decision. The scanner that I use with 11 is the same as with 9 and is on Nuance's hardware compatibility list. The problem is, it took me uninstalling and reinstalling the program to get the scanner to work at all with PaperPort. Then, when I did get it installed - and I used the advanced setup option with it, tested it, all looked good - except everytime I scan something, the program crashes! It is literally unusable as a scanning solution.I have seen a few companies with products that were once really good, sell it off to another company, and the product support seems to be essentially abandoned. It seems that this may be the case. There are no updates or bug fixes for 11, and I will not buy another PaperPort version in the future. I will attempt to go back to 9, and probably stay with that. If I run into any issues with it over time, I will look elsewhere, and I recommend others do the same. I normally don't write reviews for products, but this one is so poor, I just had to warn people
  I've used PaperPort for years mostly because it was the best of a bunch of poor options. However, Version 11 is buggier than earlier versions: every time I launch a Microsoft Office product, the PaperPort installer starts up.  There is no reference to this in the PaperPort Help file or in the ridiculously inadequate knowledgebase on the PaperPort site. Another bug imprints a "trial copy" legend on your PDF files. This one is explained in the knowledgebase, but requires you to tinker with the Registry to correct it. That's a bit ridiculous. Why are they distributing code with a known bug?  Nuance expects you to pay $9.95 for e-mail technical support - even if it's a bug in their own product.  The product is a modest performer at best, but Nuance's awful technical support policies are the real sinker here.  I've requested an RMA for a refund.Jerr
I used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it.  Boy are they right.  This thing is terrible.After installing on Windows XP SP2, as soon as I started the program it crashed.  Now every time I try to scan using my Canon Scanner, it crashes every time.Product is useless.  Wish I had of never bought it!DO NOT BUY!
After having used this product since version 4, each version had its problems.  The latest version 11 has improved document indexing and searching - a LITTLE bit - over version 10.  It does NOT scan both sides of pages as it did in version 10.  The "Capture Assistant" crashes the program.  If you need support due to bugs in the program, you have to pay, and pay, and pay
I am a little disappointed in the upgrade to Microsoft Office as it is not user friendly nor is it as accommodating as the earlier version
I bought it, installed it, tried it, uninstalled it and returned it (of course I had to reformat my computer to get things back to the way I like them). Reviews say it was a big improvement.  Maybe so, but I have no desire to learn a whole new way of doing things again. I spent years learning keyboard short cuts and putting up with a product I thought was inferior to WordPerfect (how I would love to have the reveal codes option for formatting).Be prepared for a steep learning curve. If you use word a lot and are proficient, you will find it very frustrating. Menus are different, key combinations are not all the same. You can customize it, but to be honest, I don't care. Between Vista and Office 2007, I think Microsoft has finally screwed the pooch. I'll stick with the old versions (XP and Office 2003) for now. My next computer will be a Mac running OS X and some sort of open office application. I have had enough.
I should have read these comments before ordering.  Got an OEM CD and a generic jewel box
I was expecting the nero 6 ultimate all in one instead I received nero OEM Suite. The MPEG 4 encoder they claim is not included instead there is a thirty day trial. Better business bureau should be notified
This review is for Turbo Tax Basic for Mac/PC 2005The software is easy enough to use but either out of curiosity or self abuse, I checked the results manually and found a round off flaw contained in the program.  If you are self employed and use Form SE (Self Employment Tax Form) the program fails to round "up" correctly.  The mistake favors the individual and not the Feds.  This is a math error and the IRS can red flag it.  I remember several years ago I purchased the Deluxe or Premire verson and the program recommended that I might consider putting $300 into my IRA in order to lower my tax bracket, it was great!  However subsquent versions did not do this, after which I only purchase the Basic version.
As another reviewer says:"But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all."Exactly. I've re-installed it over and over and the same thing happens. I've used Turbotax in previous years and never had a problem like this. After spending hours entering in my data, there is apparently no way to get to the final filing stage. With four days before the due date, this is disasterous. Their support site offers no hint of a fix. Mac users, stay away
This was my first time to ever attempt using a software program to file my taxes. TurboTax sounded easy enough. And it was pretty easy at first. The software interviewed me in an efficent manner and saved all of my information. But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all. I can't speak for this software on Windows machines. But if you are using Mac OS X, I suggest you explore other options first
The program does a great job in figuring my taxes. But now Intuit is charging for filing and the state program. Also I was unable to download the updates over my dial-up connection.  I called to have a CD version mailed to me but so far I haven't received it. I'm trying Tax Act this year. It is a free program and has free filing. IF I can complete the TurboTax version I will see if I can duplicate my return using Tax Act.  If so then good bye TurboTax
I have used Turbo Tax for about 20 years and have loved it.  In the past it was user-friendly, efficient and complete - it even printed out all the forms I needed - ready to send to the IRS.As usual, I purchased it this year.  The format changed and isn't nearly as user friendly as in years past.  You have to manually select the walk-through feature, section by section and it's very easy to miss sections.When I got to the end, it wouldn't let me do a review for errors until I updated the version.  But, I don't have internet at home and couldn't update.  It crashed my computer 3 times before I skipped the review totally.  (God only knows what else I skipped in the process.)When I went to print the forms - again it nagged me that the software was inferior and needed to be updated.  Again, I skipped it but the pages printed out with a nasty watermark saying the forms weren't updated and couldn't be used.  I can't use these.  I can't send them to the IRS.  So, I have to find IRS forms and manually insert the information myself.  So, why did I spend money for the software??Why would they sell a product that you can't actually use?  Yes, it'll "prepare" my forms.  But, what good is that if I can't print them out?  Why would they sell a product that was already so obsolete that you can't use it without contacting the company for another version?ABSOLUTELY - RUN - DON'T WALK - RUN RUN RUN AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.  DON'T BUY IT because it simply doesn't work.I won't use Turbo Tax again.  They have lost a faithful and long time customer
I kid you not, this suite,program,resource *THUG* IS THE WORST GARBAGE ON THE MARKET. Like others i read the shiny reviews and took a chance and purchasing it because of the frequent trips to HELL I had logged in with other so called "SECURITY SUITES" over the years. Works ok for about the first month or so and then...WHAMMMM..crash city. Think I'm joking...buy it and find out for yourself. I'm no PRO yet, but i do have enough knowledge about programming to know when my PC goes from( NORMAL to CHOKE) out of the clear blue. Uinstalled it (3X) just to make sure that it was the cause of the problem,sure enough,it was. Other reviewers mentioned thier processor being pulled to the grind...well it's true. STAY AWAY...STAY FAR..FAR..AWAY
The most recent version 7.0 was sent via a downloaded upgrade to owners of this ZoneAlarm Internet Suit a couple of weeks ago and has been a nightmare.  The ZoneAlarm forums are filled with user's complaints.  This software is full of bugs, it has crashed user's OUTLOOK and OUTLOOK EXPRESS email programs, and we are unable to use our email.  ZoneAlarm customer service is the worst!  It took them 6 days to respond to my technical request email, and the response was canned and not appropriate to the problem.  I finally called their corporate office and was told "if you don't like the program uninstall it!".  If your want to speak to their technical support they charge $2.99 per minute, even if the problem was caused by them!  At this time the software remains not fully use-able, I have no email from OUTLOOK, ZoneAlarm has not owned up to the nightmare they have created with their users, and they are not responsive as to when a fix will be available. [...
I've been a long time user of Trend Micro's PCcillin but after reading poor reviews on their latest version I decided I didn't want to take a chance on it so I went looking for different anti-virus software. I stumbled onto this ZoneAlarm (piece of junk) and after reading mostly wonderful reviews I down loaded their trial.  It didn't seem too bad. After a few weeks I bought this 3 computer suite and installed it. I went a while longer and notice my computer's performance was not as good as it was. I downloaded upgrades and uninstalled old versions and installed new.  Now after about a month my computer is practically unusable (as well as the kid's - they have been screaming about slow computer since the start).  This zonealarm is the worst software I have ever used.  It hogs CPU and memory.  It gets the CPU usage to 80 - 100% and it doesn't free it up.  I shut down all programs and CPU just keeps churning away. The interesting thing is that at times I would check task manager processes and system idle would be 90% but when you check the performance tab the CPU chart would be near 100%?  Go figure! I finally said enough and uninstalled it (and deleted every occurrence of zonealarm out of the registry) and downloaded Trend Micro's pccillin.  It's installed and I got my old machine back.  Log-ins take 40 seconds were they would take over 3 minutes with ZA.  CPU is back to normal.  You couldn't give me this cr*ppy software.  I wish I would have stuck with pccillin and saved the $40
I bought this product because of positive member reviews and and outstanding review in CNet. However, I just bought a new Dell Inspiron E1505 that shipped with Windows Vista Home Premium, and ZoneAlarm 6.5 is flat out incompatible with the new OS. I downloaded ZoneAlarm 7.0 and that is flat out incompatible as well. I'm sure this is a great Security Suite for Windows XP, but beware if you have Vista. There seems to be no update on their website when Zonelabs will release a Vista compatible ZoneAlarm. (They mention something about "after January 2007", but it's March, for crying out loud!) So there's my purchase price of a good product down the drain
I purchased this product after reading many negative reviews on other products (my last Internet security product was PC-Cillin, I didn't renew because of the Low ratings for 2007). What I found was that an huge load was put on my processor, and system memory apparently because I use a program that feeds video over the internet from a network cam.  I never had problems like this before, and after some research on the ZA support site, I found other users who were having similar problems with their processors overclocking.  VSMON.exe seems to be the culprit, and is the main component of the Zone Alarm product.  Everything seems fine, as long as I don't try to use video over the internet(including IM webcams).  I would recommend thinking about if you intend on using webserver programs before making this purchase
I bought a new PC last week and maxed it out with a gig of ram and 512 video card...Vista was preinstalled...These are the basic specs of the PC I have:AThlon 64 X2 dual core processor2 Gig memory DDR 2250 SATA HDDnot only did this thing run slow...I found out that a lot of my old software wouldn't work...what gives????I ran Company of Heroes (seemingly a surefire bet considering the upgrades) and that crawles like I was trying to run this on a minimum spec'ed machine...and mind u I bought this new AND did upgrades (an extra 250 dollars worth) so I wound up spending a nice part of Saturday reformatting the HDD and putting XP back on my machine and viola! I really get to see whta kind of power I am working with...for those of you thinking about going back to XP, do it and wait until Vista gets figured out...it's 250 dollar resource hog and it won't be on my machine for a little while...and while u are at it...please be sure to back up your drivers files...
I bought the vista upgrade with my dell computer.  I tried to install and half way through the set up, after it had uninstalled my old programs, I got a message to abort.  The abort left me with a damaged media program, and thus far I have spent over $400 trying to re-connect damaged files and programs.  My best advice is to wait until Microsoft gets the "kinks" out of the vista program and then buy the upgrade
I am very disappointed in Vista.  It took about 12 hours to install and now my computer is extremely slow.  I would absolutely NOT recommend it
The Vista set up is nice but is buggy and incompatible with a lot of games and upgrades
This maybe the worst interface I have ever had the displeasure of working with and that includes console applications with DOS interfaces. Edlin and fdisk are more user friendly than the McAfee's Security Center. There is noway to disable the software except by uninstalling the program or opening XP's admin tools and then forcing the services to stop, which is not a recommenable approach for the average user.Here is a short list of the probelms that I encountered. Counter Spy is cheaper, easier to use and has an interface that is user friendly!* cannot select to disable during non-internet use so I can run software that Security Center has conflicts with like ProTools 7.3 recording software.* the scan results are vague, ie returns 6 quarantined threats but doesn't display what the threats are and you can't print the result either.* There are more......There are some good features but the detractors win by a land slide.
Much worse than previous McAfee editions.I dropped Norton on some older desktops due to its lack of support for W2000. I then went to the free edition of AVG anti-virus, which was OK but slowed things down. Thinking "you get what you pay for" I sprung for McAfee which has been OK in the past. The edition I purchased has 3 licenses.  I installed one of these on my wife's XP laptop as well as one of my desktops (luckily, she's still talking to me).The 2007 McAfee Suite makes AVG look like a free Ferrari. Absolutely terrible performance, coupled with a mediocre interface. Perhaps the only poorer-performing way to assure you'll never get a virus, spam, etc. would be to hit your motherboard with a hammer.This will slow down your computer (even worse, unpredictably). If you have lots of email in Outlook or Outlook Express expect to open your mail box, then have a long break before you can do a thing (as it rechecks everything for spam). There's a partial workaround for this, but users shouldn't have to search for workarounds. Every Web action now has noticeable latency -- as well as slower applications when McAfee is grinding away in the background.  If you liked your current anti-spam, kiss it goodbye -- McAfee may not let you keep it. McAfee (like Norton) is also difficult to remove from your system. What prompted this review? Today it appears the update process rebooted my computer without requiring a "yes" from me.As for alternatives, I wasn't able to get Kaspersky anti-virus to run on an older machine -- somewhare a remnant of Norton persisted (possibly a document tagged Symantec etc. left over from a day of working with them ages ago). However, I did get it running on a laptop and its better than Norton-McAfee-and even AVG in my opinion.So, consider Kaspersky or another vendor. If that doesn't work try AVG. It will be interesting to see how McAfee responds -- they've really shot themselves in the foot with this release
I have used McAfee for at least 5 years. This 2007 Suite is a piece of trash. I takes soooooo long to find a site that IF it eventually finds it you forget what you were looking for.  At half the sites, if they are found, it will not allow me to progress into the site. In setting it up it insisted upon registering but never did tell me if the registration was completed; just kept blinking. I assume it was registered because it did update. I cannot get into half the sites I visit on a regular basis. It won't even find the McAfee site. Just sits there searching until it gives me a notice it can't find the site. Never will I buy another piece of software from McAfee. I should have read the reviews before I bought it but I had been satisfed with the previous version so I never bothered reading them. Dumb move on my part. Dumb one on yours if you buy it. Never again.
As everyone else has said, this product is not at all what it should be.It slows down the internet browsing to a crawl (my laptop that has crashed several times, is several years older and runs wireless loads pages faster than my new computer with McAfee).You can't close it, as others have said, other than uninstalling.The funniest part I've found, however, is that it warns you the first time it tries to access.  Being amused, I refused the program permission to update itself.  Other than removing the program, it was the best thing I did using McAfee
Buyer beware: this program will critically impair your system!  Internet loading will be drastically crippled.  Expect frequent system choppiness due to automatic downloading and background processes.  There is NO WAY to close McAfee to get around these drawbacks other than to uninstall.  I am going to return this first thing next week.  I gave them a few weeks to improve performance with patches and upgrades, but nothing has changed.  If only I had read the reviews ahead of time.  Bottomline: if you don't mind these side-effects, by all means purchase this program;  McAfee has solid protection.  But there are easier ways to get that protection
I had McAfee ISS 2006 and loved it.  I bought 2007 when my subscription expired.  Oh my dear God!! What have I done!!  The thing is complete crap. My computer is 1 year old with duel core chip and 2GB of memory.  This thing never crashed.  I loaded 2007 and it was crashing every 5 minutes!!  I could not get on the internet with my browsers.  McAfee was updating and Microsoft was reporting the serious errors with no problem, but forget about trying to get help from their website.  They have got to be kidding!!  I tried to uninstall it, forget about it.  I was able to get enough of it off so that my computer is able to access the internet and not crash every 5 minutes.  Thanks alot McAfee, you took a good product and turned it into crap and made a mess of my computer.  I downloaded a free firewall and AVG anti virus. 
I installed this on my laptop and it slowed it down to a crawl.  I deinstalled it , installed Norton 2005, bought the subscription Renewal and my laptop is back up to speed. You have been warne
I didn't use this particular product but the version that came with my computer which was slow but not the end of the world. The problem I had with them is that they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning that they are going to do it. I had a 2-year subscription and they send me an e-mail 2 years later saying they charged my account with never telling me that I was in auto enrollment! When I called to complain they of course had someone who couldn't inderstand me and I had to spell my e-mail address THREE times and was told it would take 3-5 days for the refund to be processed which is crap because I work for an online store and its easier to void a sale and cheaper for the vendor to do a refund the same day! I asked for a manager TWICE, the second time they came back they had the nerve to ask me if I was interested in an upgrade and subscribing to their magazine, and was put on the never-ending hold until I gave up 37 minutes later which was probably the plan all along. SO I called my bank and put a stop payment on the automatic payment. Now I am searching for another protection program and calling their customer service before my purchase to see how it goes
Do not use this product.  It is very hard to remove from your computer.  It is harder to install than Norton, and is an inferior product.  I will never buy their product again.
This software is "One Time Use"! If you have a notebook and laptop, you won't be able to install for both! It sucks
Yes, it's easy to install, configure and use. The footprint is small and it doesn't hog resources. That's the good news. The bad news is that this software's virus detection rate is abysmal and the company's tech support is worse. So, in short, don't *trust* it. Two examples, starting with tech support. After building a new computer, I had several blue screens (stop errors, BSODs) and my analysis seemed to indicate that EZ Antivirus was at least partially responsible. I emailed support with all the relevant info. Their (paraphrased) reply: "We understand that you are having Faults in Windows. This is because you have Windows installed. If you did not have Windows you would not have Faults. Thank you for contacting E-Trust." I should have that engraved on a plaque. Example 2, AV detection: When my subscription ran out, I uninstalled EZ and tried a demo of Kaspersky. It found 5 viruses on my computer that EZ never told me about. In this case, it's 2 strikes and you're out. Goodby, Computer Associates
Like some of the other reviews, I loved cool edit pro. Then Adobe got a hold of it and royally screwed it up with 2.0. I use this program often and tried to give it a chance. No way around it, it sucks now. I am going to use Sonar, a much better product. The only thing I like about 2.0 is that you can burn to a disc from Audition. That is the only reason why I gave it one star. This is not a user friendly program
I agree with the other reviews this is a horrible piece of software. I am a software developer and have written some serious applications in my career, and this one ranks at the bottom of the barrel.I have a stock Dell XP machine, and after a 15-minute install, Audition 2.0 crashes every time on startup. I never even got it to run. Tried calling Adobe support -- useless...waited 35 minutes on hold then hung up. Search of Google groups for answers revealed nothing, as did their support site.I *loved* Cool Edit 2000, and even Audition 1.5 to some degree. This new version is what happens when too many engineers get put on a project. It's a remnant of a once great application. Avoid it like the plague
I wanted to make sure people who look at this product have a full understanding that Adobe Audition 2.0 WILL NOT install on a Windows 2000 Pro or Server operating system. Almost EVERY reference I have seen regarding OS requirements say Windows but not specifically Windows XP. The only exceptions have been on the Audition box itself and this Amazon listing (go Amazon). So if you are a Windows 2000 user understand that you will need XP for this product. If you can find a copy of Audition 1.5 you're good to go.I would say more about the product if I could actually get it installed but with the 12 PCs I use not a one has XP so I have a $300+ book end until I can upgrade (if you can call it that) to XP
Adobe Audition is my favorite program. I use it more than any other program I have on my computer. I have used it to restore thousands of old phonograph discs. I am only giving them one star because I can't give them no stars for this joke.I knew this was going to happen. I had been using Cool Edit Pro for a long time when Adobe bought it and I knew that they were going to turn it into an Adobe product and screw it all up. I am very fortunate that I went to Adobes web site and downloaded the free trail version. I would have been really upset if I had actually paid money for this dog.Lets start with the boot up time. I own a 2 year old average laptop and Audition 1.5 used to boot in about 2 seconds. 2.0 takes 20 seconds. That is almost as long as Photoshop or Premiere Pro. Next we have the user interface. They destroyed it. And the old one worked so well. Adobe is really hung up about making absolutely everything a "Palette" and so now every little thing is a palette, allowing you to resize and relocate them to your hearts desire. But after about a half an hour of trying I'll be darned if I could not make the 2.0 interface remotely resemble the 1.5 interface. The shortcuts buttons have been removed (wow that makes a lot of sense), however you can get it back if you look long enough for the place to do it. (Don't bother to right-click anything, in their imperial wisdom right-clicking is now pretty useless.) But if you do put the shortcuts back up they are now all black and white and it is really difficult to find the one you want. In place of the shortcuts they added some icons that I have yet to figure out or to need. What are they thinking????A lot of the presets have been reconfigured and trying to figure them out gave me a headache. After several hours of playing with this pile of garbage I decided to uninstall it and return to using 1.5.
If, like myself, you have many DX and VST plug-ins installed on your system, then Audition 2.0 is definitely NOT the choice with you.  Somehow, the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd-party plugs such as Waves Diamond Bundle.  Oddly enough, this was not a problem in earlier editions of Audition, or its former incarnation, CoolEdit.  But now, Audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many VST and DX plugs (except, of course, the ones made by Adobe themselves.)Bottom line?  This software is crap.  Absolute crap.  If you're serious about audio production, go with Wavelab.  Heck, even free multitrack audio software like Kristal works better than this.If, for some reason, you absolutely need Audition, then go with an earlier, more stable version, such as 1.5.2.0 is about as useful as a football bat. 
I am not a bookkeeper. Without bookkeeping software I would be lost! I own a small business and help keep books for a friend's business. I have Quickbooks from 1996 and love it so I convinced my friend to get this newer version. I am very disappointed with the format and see very little similarity between them. Aarrrgh! 
This program is terrible to deal with.  I run a small business and bought QuickBooks Simple Start.  Once loaded and you go to use the program there is a pop up requiring you have an Administrator.  When loading the software it does not tell you to select or bypass the Administrator requirement.  You only learn this when you first go to use the program. The URL they give on the pop up for troubleshooting does not address this issue, either.  You are just locked out of the program.  Now it gets fun. So, you have to speak to them for help.  But this is where it gets to be no laughing matter.  To get help you have to email them to ask for help.  They then call you back at their convenience.  If you are busy working when they call back you have to start all over.  I have yet to be able to use this product since I bought it 3 weeks ago because they will not call back when it is convenient for me the customer and will not let me call in at my covenience.  Even worse, since they have bought out all their competitors QuickBooks customer support no longer is available after regular hours when a small business owner has the time to handle such operations issues.  I can't return this product for a refund because I have loaded it.  My first clue to how not user friendly this product is should have been the title: Simple Start
I'm sure it's a good product for beginners, but I already had an older version of Quickbooks (from 1995) and the only way I could export/import the old data into a newer version of Quickbooks was with QB Pro.  Simple Start doesn't allow you to import data from older versions
This is by far the most basic editing/creative package that I have ever used.  I have been using every version of Print Shop since some of their early versions.  I have Print Shop 22 and was haveing issues with printing in MS Vista.  I figured that I would be able to purchase one of Broderbund's similar products (one made for Vista) and it would be similar in style and usage.  Wrong.  I was not able to import other Print Shop projects, printing is limited, no drag and drop feature from other programs, limited editing, formating of text is off when copying from one document to another, sizing pictures and text boxes while editing projects is limited to dragging corners only, and on-and-on.  I tried to use Broderbund's tech support page, but it is very limited to their FAQ section.  Try asking a question or emailing for help; good luck.  I will fumble with this product for awhile (only because I can print more than one page at a time, because PS 22 in Vista only allows for this)and wait until the next compatible version of PS comes out for Windows Vista.  I would have thought there would of at least been a patch by now.  I think they may have made Zoom the way it is now to allow for newer, better versions.  I hope this helps...
I was very disappointed in this software.  It's not really good for anything and I still haven't figure out why this was even released.  I own Printmaster 15, American Greetings Creata Card 8, and an few other photo and scrapbook programs.  This software has templates to make banners, cards, invitations, and all that stuff.  The templates are few compared to other programs and then to customize them, well you really can't.  If you try to start out with a blank template and add your own photos you are limited to what you can do.  No borders, edging, font manipulating.  It's just insert the photo, do some basic photo touch ups and that is pretty much it.  I wanted to add shadows, edges, frames to my pictures and couldn't.  The fonts could only be made in single color.  You could not add outlines or drop shadows, NOTHING.  Add the font, pick your size, pick your style, and that was it.  You can only save to their 1 file format which of course only works with zoom.  No e-mailing or file converting.  What good is this program I have yet to find out.  I spend time to make a birthday invitation from my own pictures.  Well guess what, I couldn't e-mail it to my guests.  Print is all it does.  Complete waste of money.  This is the first software I ever purchased that I will be returning.  Spend a few extra bucks and get something like Print Master, Print Shop, or something comparible
I bought this product based on Consumer Reports review.  I've had Norton and McAfee in the past which slowed down my system.  My computer is slower to start up with ZoneAlarm, but faster than McAfee while on.  However, most of the time, I need to shut off ZoneAlarm in order to access the internet - just like another reviewer.  Defeats the purpose don't you think?  It also recognized my offices's software as a virus and although I allowed access, it keeps showing it as a virus.  I'm going to have to go to another product. 
The idea of being notified of every possibly suspicious action sounds good, but in practice ZoneAlarm is too intrusive for most home computer users. It seems to have bugs too, starting with an installation that initially wouldn't work on one of the computers on my home LAN. ZoneAlarm also seems to forget some actions that are allowed and supposedly remembered. I haven't gotten exasperated enough to buy another antivirus product and uninstall ZoneAlarm yet, but I'm close
I am very disappointed in this program.  I have been doing my own graphics/cards for about 10 years.  I started with Print Shop (early edition) and progressed thru all the updates.  I then switched to PrintMaster and LOVED it!!!  Again, I have progressed to each new verion with very little or no problems...until now!  This has got to be the worst of the worst--- the program did not want to load without being babied.  When it finally loaded, it was very confusing and I found that I needed to get my graphics from the internet!  The area I live in only allows me to have dial up---you can imagine how long it takes to get the graphics I want!  If you are interested in doing your own graphics/cards, skip this program...go back to PrintMaster Platinum 16 for much better results.  As far as I am concerened, the River Deep Company needs to hide this edition in the DEEPEST RIVER they can find
I've been using a Win 98 version of this software for years and the opportunity to upgrade to the XP version was tempting.However, it does not work at all in my portuguese XP.After searching for the misterious error code through the manufacturer's database I was informed that it does not work in non-english Win XP.All the previous versions worked fine in my PCs but this one was totally disappointing. Living in Brazil, I had to give up my money since the shipping costs were about the same value I would recover.Shame on them
You've GOT to be kidding me.  The Fry's salesperson told me Microsoft Word couldn't print business cards and that I should buy this product to make high quality business cards.What an incredible lie.This is such a piece of junk.  It has almost nothing.  The cards look TERRIBLE, a total embarassment.  It's HARD TO USE, it's easier to make it in Word.LIES LIES LIES JUNK GARBAGE LIES LIES LIES
I love PrintMaster.  I'm currently using PrintMaster 16 Platinum.  I have used many generations of this program with great success.  I have taught classes on creative desktop publishing and always recommended--even sold--PrintMaster, but this one is terrible!  Most of the images, even the previews, seem to be online and require a download which is very slow.  The thumbnails are low resolution and hard to see, so you have to download previews just to get a good look.  Most of the images can't be accessed at all, because there is a prompt for the intall/program disk.  There is no such disk.  There are separate install and program disks, neither of which satisfies the program.    Encore, which now distributes the program, does not support it.  Broderbund does not not support it, except through its website which does not address this issue.  If you try to phone customer service, you pay for a call to get an automated response which sends you to another response which tells you to go to the website.  Do not purchase this product without a money-back guarantee
I've used Printmaster 12 platinum on DVD and liked it well enough but the disk wore out.  I knew from reviews of subsequent versions that Broderbund was giving us less and less but even still I was stunned by just how much less.  Where are all the projects?  Even counting the online projects there just isn't much here for anyone.  For kid's masks, version 12 has at least a dozen but this version gives you 2!  The cards are terrible - many are just small clipart images with a white background.  (At least you won't need much ink).  In short, if you want to create anything decent you'll have to design it yourself.  Inspired by the ONE nice-looking cut-out card, I was able to search the art work and create several nice cards that I would be pleased to send. 
I have used lots of PrintMaster versions I had some trouble with version 16 with the address book so I was happy to find that a new version was out and called to order they told me I wouldn't have a problem with the new one.  This new version is JUNK; all the projects have to be downloaded so if you don't have a high speed connection forget it!  I don't like the fact that you have to go on line every time you want to create a card etc.  I sent a note to customer service and just received a generic response.  So looks like I have to find new software
Everyone uses office.  Everyone is familiar with office.  So why did MS change the interface to make it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get anything done?  I am computer savy (I'm an engineer) and I find the new ribbon interface totally infuriating.  Worst of all there is NO way to go back to the "old" drop down menu system.  It honestly takes me 10x the time to get anything done with word/powerpoint because they've buried functionality behind these ridiculous ribbons.  MS claims that you will be able to be much more productive once you're familiar with the ribbons.  I don't know/care whether that's true or not.  The learning curve to get to the point of fluency with their new UI is immense.  So much so that the time investment to become proficient FAR FAR FAR out ways any "increase" in productivity....not to mention that it's overpriced.  Offce 2003 is a far superior product
Never recueved the product.  Waiting for refund for over 6 weeks
I just wanted to write a little note about getting the case open.  I just received my copy today, and in my excitement discarded the darn instruction on how to open......I know you're all probably thinking I'm just stupid.....after realizing what I did - I'd have to agree!  :)Anyway, if you pull off the "peel" tab and get rid of it - here's what you do:  See that red tab at the top of the box/package?  Hold the case from the "spine" and pull the little red tab down.  I found it most effective if I used my thumb and index finger (I'm right handed) on the tab and placed my middle finger on the top of the spine, and pushed a little with my middle finger.  I've gotten so used to ink cartridges, and other items that have a "don't pull this yet" type of tab, I was a little afraid of touching it....until of course I finally found what I did with my "peel" notice and found I did need to pull on the little red tab.  So that's all there is to it.  Again, most of you out there probably think I'm stupid - but for the one or two others out there that tossed that peel tab  - Enjoy.  I'm going to install tomorrow, and once I've used the programs I'll see about a real review then
this item puts more spyware on the pc then it takes away do not bu
The product was fine, but, I received an older version and as a result I couldn't properly update it even after registering it.  As a result, I purchased the newest version available directly from Lavasoft and it works fine and I have had no trouble updating it.  Why didn't you specify what version it was on your website; then I could have made an informed decision?
Ordered version 1.06, but was sent v. 1.05. Lavasoft website will upgrade the old version if I send them my order number. However they will not accept an Amazon number. Amazon customer support said sorry, that they would accept a return and provide a refund.I will be more careful where I buy software in the future
slowed a new system down too much when running in backgroud. Went back to free verison
The updates are frequent and expensive. Good program, but it's not worth the trouble and expense of upgrading
way to many problems with this version, if you want to replace all your printers, scanners, sound cards and so on, go for it.otherwise stay away
The software requires a "patch"...not a big deal.Once I got the thing up and running my attention span was about 5 minutes.  The "goofiness" is a detriment and the aspect of trying to learn is hindered by the balance of trying to figure out how to use the software.It has a tutorial but that is a waste of time as well.If you are SERIOUS about trying to learn some basic conversational Spanish, try something else.  Don't waste your time or money on this one..
Great product for what it does!  However, my experience with Quicken products such as Will Maker is that there are no updates.  You'll have to buy the next year's version to stay up to date for changes in your state.  At the end of 2007, the software is obsolete
This program causes my computers to blue screen. Trend Micro has been contacted twice, but have not responded
I bought PC-Cillin because it has 4 stars in Amazon rating, which is much better than McAfee and Norton. But I am wrong. Before installed PC-Cillin, everything is fine. But after installed, I can not access my yahoo email. After calling customer service two times, even uninstalled PC-Cillin, I still can not access yahoo email. Now I have to re-install Windows XP. It will cost me a lot of time. Anyone knows what wrong is
This upgrade is a disaster. First of all, in Word, the view markups function is the default now, so you have to go through and change all the settings to hide markups (most people in my department do not want to see those distracting colors and balloons and do not need to edit the doc in any way). However, if you want to send a document that does not have the tracked changes embedded -- because you don't know which version of Word the recipient has, and you can't take the chance of them seeing all those comments -- you have to go through the document again, view markups, reject the comments, Accept Changes, and resave. It's kind of difficult to explain, and frustrating too. People think that if they can't see it, then the recipient won't be able to see it either.This is a good explanation from a Microsoft help forum:*Not displaying* tracked changes isn't the same as *not having* tracked changes. Even when using Word 2002, the changes were still in the documents, and anyone could see them just by turning on the display. All that has happened in 2003 is that the display is automatic. The way to have documents in which changes are not displayable is to remove the changes from the documents entirely -- and to do that you must *accept or reject* all the changes. Nothing you do with the view will be sufficient. If you need to retain a record of the changes, you'll have to maintain two sets of documents: one with the changes, which *never* leave your office, and another that has been "scrubbed" and can be sent out. Still, it's a big problem and more unnecessary work than 2002's version. Also, Outlook's new default view is quite different than before. The panes are set differently, so you have to go to View/Reading Panes to change the positions. And then you have to ungroup items (the breaks in between the weeks are very annoying...most people don't like that, although I guess some people think it looks more organized).Oh, Microsoft - can't live with it, can't live without it.Almost forgot...the buttons/icons are prettier in this version, and we all know that that makes a huge difference. Yessss! Pretty buttons! I can die happy now.
The major flaw with this product is that it's not clear which version of Office you can upgrade FROM.Note: It does NOT work with Office SBE!!Various sources say various things, even the Microsoft site isn't helpful
I discovered a bug in the program which seriously affects its integrity.Have been on the phone with Quicken techs numerous times and they finally acknowledged that there is a problem with the program and a patch (fix) needs to be developed.  So far though, they have not done it
If you have not bought this yet, don't. If you have, but haven't installed it yet, don't. I've used Quicken for years, and this is the worst implentation yet. The major problem, an issue known to the company, is that reports will not print properly on many printers. Wait until they issue a fix before you use this product
Well you certainly will be able to recognize words and answer the questions correctly, but if you're expecting to understand what the words actually mean...I wouldn't recommend this.I was able to answer the first seven chapters easily and get all questions right but I have no idea what any words in the sentence/caption actually mean.  I've used it for a month know and I have no greater knowledge of Chinese than when I started.... 
If you do not have a mediocre-level understanding of Chinese, stay away from this product.  Rosetta Stone has a very unique approach that might work for children under the age of seven (the critical language learning years), but for every other beginner in the language the software is almost impossible to use.  The object of the "game" is to match a Mandarin phrase (said aloud and written in pinyin) to a poor, pixellated photo.  For example, in the first section of the first lesson, you are shown a ball, an airplane, an elephant and a horse.  A phrase will be read and you have to match it with the correct photo.  It gets much too complicated after that.  Basically, it's a pure guessing game for most of the time.  I gave this product a serious evaluation even after reading the plethora of poor reviews.  I thought the unique style was interesting enough to give a chance, but I feel as though I wasted hours and hours.  I can remember only two or three words from the entire experience.  Although I have spent fewer hours on Pimsleur's Mandarin audio lessons, I am able to recall many, many more words and phrases.  Although Pimsleur's isn't perfect, it's definitely the best choice for a beginner (along with a solid Chinese-English dictionary).If you do not know well the basics of Mandarin, this software is completely useless.  Buy Pimsleur's instead
This is the most god awful method for learning a language I have ever encountered. My jaw dropped when I saw that NASA and other government agencies were using this software in order to learn a foreign language. If that is truly the case then I demand my tax dollars back. It is THAT bad. The reason I gave this software a shot is because their marketing campaign has been asserting that it was the absolute definitive method for learning a new language. You're probably looking at it for the same reason.First, you should know that you can purchase a set of flash cards from your local bookstore and it is just as effective as any rosetta stone softare and costs 90% less.I used this software when I borrowed it from a friend in order to see if it was better than my current method of learning mandarin, which I'll get into later. I had an opportunity to make copies of this software when it was in my possession but decided against it. Not out of fear of piracy penalties, just plain because I would rather not have this software than have a copy of it. That's really how awful it is.Imagine if your parents tried to teach you English by only teaching you noun/picture association? It wouldn't work unless you learned about proper English grammar and proper syntax. If you learned about verbs and other things. This program will assume you know all your Chinese numbers automatically. In the very beginning a picture of a little girl will show up and it will verbally say 'one little girl' in mandarin... however it will not tell you which word means the number one, which word means girl, and so on. It's a guessing game, not a learning experience.All the positive reviews I've seen for any Rosetta stone software on amazing seem absolutely phony and fabricated to me (especially on the Rosetta Stone Japanese page). Please beware, and there is no better way to prove that what I'm saying is true other than trying a demo for yourself. I am sure that it is as bad as the full retail version that I used for a week.The absolute best method I've used for learning mandarin has been pimsleur's audio cds. (I've never tried berlitz and pimsleur's other competitors, but I'm sure they are better than Rosetta stone). I have used Mandarin I and II so far from pimsleur, and I am able to hold impressive conversations with other fluent speakers of mandarin. The great thing about it is that pimsleur explains everything to you, allows you to say it out loud, there is no brute memorization involved with pimsleur, only natural language assimilation.Just ask yourself this, when you learned English as a child. Did you learn    by learning how to read and write first? Or did you learn how to speak and listen first? Didn't you learn syntax first and then use what you learned to formulate your own sentences? That's exactly how pimsleur has taught me mandarin. I was surprised how I was able to create my own grammatically correct sentences with pimsleur only a few lessons in.Go ahead and try a demo of any Rosetta stone language. It should be enough to keep you away from Rosetta stone in favor of any of their competitors.I've heard good things about berlitz and others, but pimsleur in my opinion is the absolute best.
You've got to be kidding me. There is no English translation, just pictures and Mandarin phrases.How are people suppose to figure it out without a straight forward english definitions or explanation for each phrase?They're suppose to be teaching Mandarin to an English speaker, not some boy raised by wolves who never knew any language.This is retarded. Worst product ever.
Their approach might work for other languages, but for Chinese it's critically important to understand the grammar of the language, which Rosetta Stone never explains. It simply displays four pictures at you, with some incomprehensible (to a beginner) Chinese near them, and you have to learn to match incomprehensible words with the pictures. I've taken Chinese for two years, and I still found it impossible to learn anything from it. I either knew the words already, or I couldn't learn whatever it was they were trying to teach.I would be happy with just a videotaped lecture of a Mandarin college course, but I can't find anything like this for sale or free online
I liked the software itself.  Being the first year I used it, I thought I'd start being a regular TT customer.Then it was April 17 2007 and I tried to e-file.  The servers would not respond ALL DAY. There were no admins to be reached on the support sites or the forums (except for one who said "I don't know what is the problem and I have nothing to tell you").One major failing with this software is that it cannot AUTOMATICALLY try to connect.  If it fails, it says "try again in 10 minutes".  Which I've had to do all night.Now - I will miss my tax deadline and have spent 6 hours at my computer trying to get connected.  Mail is not an option now as my car is gone.This is a major failure of the company and an utter lack of support, since their officials apparently couldn't be bothered to come in to work on tax day to offer us any solutions.I will not buy again.
This is a product that is dependent on constant upgrades because the most current version of the 2006 tax forms are often not available when it first comes out.  That is the nature of the product.  However, for the third year in a row, many Macintosh users have run into problems with their automated online form upgrade process.  If the automated upgrade process does not work, you can do the upgrade manually, but that is a somewhat complex process.  Alternatively, you can order a snail mail version of the upgraded program, if you can ever get through to the phone number you have to call.  They always seem to be encountering a large volume of calls no matter what time you call.  Its a great product once you get it upgraded to contain the most recent version of the forms.  I wonder if the automated upgrade process works for Windows users?  At any rate, until they fix the automated upgrade process, an important part of the software, I have to rate it as low as possible
Having used Turbo Tax since 1990 I feel that I am qualified to comment on it.I have also used Quicken, Quicken Deluxe, Quicken Home  Business, QuickBooks Pro 2003  QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition. The Turbo Tax product seems to get more user UN-FRIENDLY each year.  The navigation features do not allow as much mobility thru the program as they did in the late nineties and early 2000's.  Like I said I WAS using QuickBooks Pro 2003 until tax time last year.  I purchased Turbo Tax Home  Business like I had for the past 4 years, and really got a shock when I found out that it would not import my data from QuickBooks Pro 2003.  Three year old software that was not compatible with Turbo Tax in 2006(actually 2005 tax year).  I ended up purchasing QuickBooks Premier Contractors Edition 2006 ($280+) in order to upgrade just to get my taxes done.  Intuit in my opinion is a perfect example of major corporate greed.  I am done with them and will purchase TaxCut this year
Mutual fund basis calculations are broken,  updates fail on the mac.  Not to mention no state in this edition.  It's absurd how many different versions of TurboTax there are this year.  It almost takes longer to try to figure out which one to buy than it does to do your taxes.  I'm done with TurboTax, switching to TaxCu
Have used TurboTax for years with no real problems.  The low rating is due to the following:Bought this in a store and discovered later when trying to download the state that it is FEDERAL ONLY!  If I had known that I would have ponied up the extra minor $ in the store rather than the extra $30 for download.  Last year the state was included with this version - this year Intuit's new fine-grained tiering of their product line ripped me off!Also, the price for this product is way too high, and the lack of an upgrade path is (pay less if you are a loyal customer) completely sucks.  Intuit almost lost me a couple of years ago when they introduced product activation.  They are in serious danger of losing me again
I have 3 computers with different expiration dates for the installed Norton anti-virus programs.  I purchased the 3-pack and installed it into the computers as the old subscriptions expired.  I then found out that the clock for the 3 units started when the program was installed into the first computer.  When I contacted Norton, they acknowledged that it was designed that way and gave me a code to enter into the three computers in order to increase their protection to a full.  When the code was entered into the first computer the clock increased to 1 year in that computer.  Norton would not allow the code to be entered into the other 2 computers.  I will never purchase another Norton product
Extremely difficult to unistall. Endless loop. Do NOT buy this product or if you do then be prepared for an exremely fustrating experience. I will never use NAV again
This program works after it's installed, but the installation process is unbelievably flawed.  If you have a version of Norton on your computer already, this may cause all kinds of problems with the new installation.  Not only did I have to uninstall all versions (after Norton lets you install the new one), but I had to make a bunch of changes to Windows, also.  On top of that, while you're struggling to install (I got it on to one computer easily, a second with some difficulty, and the third... well, it's been several days of struggle), Norton counts down the number of days in the subscription.  So if you install on one computer today, and another two months later, then your subscription on all your machines still expires a year from now.I don't see how Symantec can put out a program that doesn't allow you to upgrade easily... after all these years, they can't fix this major bug?  That's just pathetic
I spent 3 days trying to get this installed.  I think the complication was that I had Norton Systemworks 2005 and wanted to add the NAV 2006 on top of it.  Well I finally got it done, but not until I'd restored my system to a backup from before I'd installed NSW 2005.  At that point I had NSW 2003 installed.  I had to manually uninstall that and remove tons of entries from the registry.  Norton's automated uninstall failed over and over so I gave up on that and did it by hand.  Then I installed NSW 2005 with NAV.  When I went to install NAV 2006 it was unable to uninstall the old version.  So I had to restore the system again.  This time I installed NSW 2005 without NAV.  I was then able to install NAV 2006.  It is working now.  It just shouldn't be this difficult
Bought the 3pack for home use.  Installed it on two pc's and then had defective a defective new pc that it was installed on and removed.  NOW, it won't let me activate on the new computer - their system is flawed!!!!  They want me to mail in original invoice, unlock code and disk and THEN they'll see what they want to do.  This will all take at least 2 to 3 weeks, in the meantime there is no protection on this computer.  HAAAAA!They really need to have a specific code for each activation so that it updates to the active computer it is being used on - they really could figure this out.  They're taking the easy way out and getting more $$$ in the process.This combined with all other slow down issues, I'm switching to ZONE Suite, as I've used Zone Alarm for years and it is great.Best of luck
Bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago (three computers at home) and worked ok- no viruses. Then I did what I thought was a clean install of XP Pro from XP Home on one of the computers, and it carried over a lot of garbage from XP Home I wanted to get rid of, but that's another issue (clean install?}. After installing XP Pro, I was warned I didn't have virus protection and so I tried installing my NAV again. You would think at some point NAV would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a Windows upgrade, and that the NAV was legitimate. Nope- fatal error and computer lock-up, which I was able to survive. No contact opportunity at the Symantec web site.I simply opted for Microsoft's recommended anti-virus software- Computer Associates. Another twenty. Then I had a heck of a time uninstalling NAV, which wouldn't install and now wouldn't uninstall. What a waste of time and money. Who creates these viruses? We certainly know who benefits from them.There is really nothing you can do- they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout. This little note means diddily, but thanks to Amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something. 
This program is causing many people difficulties.  I had to make two seperate calls to customer service.
I have a recently purchased Acrobat 8.0 Professional. It installed fine on my new Vista machine, although it cites only Office 2003 products. But I have MS Office 2007.  After installation (and reinstallation) no Acrobat conversion options show on MS Word, and when trying to use Acrobat directly for an MS Word file conversion it first reinstalls itself, and then reports that the Word file (I have tried several) is corrupt.I now have to ask colleagues with older software to do my PDF conversion.I could not find out if or when Adobe plans to be compatible with Vista and Office 2007
The first order I received for Italian 1 and 2  had defective disks, which were not replaced by the manufacturer when I called their customer service.  When I re-submitted my complaint to Amazon, they immediately sent me a replacement of the whole set. However, these disks also are very slow to load on my new MacPro laptop, and quit at times. I am not able to recommend Rosetta Stone
I bought this as Christmas present for my daughter who will be traveling to Italy this spring as part of a College course she is taking, and she will be spending a semister there next year as well ... She just called me for school to help her resolve an ERROR in the installation: The install reaches 100% then states it has encountered an ERROR, and quits. It remains uninstalled and is thus far UNUSABLE. An awefully expensive piece of plastic that does NOTHING. As a Senior Software Engineer I'd have been fired for less ... The RosettaStone WebSite/Knowledgebase offers NO information on this
I specifically bought Turbo Tax Premier because of stocks sales/purchases we made in 2006.  The section on stock income was confusing and it took me several times to figure out what information Turbo Tax wanted where.  When I thought I had it figured out and finished that section, I thought I would repeat it to make sure I did it right.  To my surprise, the second time I entered the information I received a different total than the first time.  So I did it a third time.  The third time matched the second, so I figured it must be right.  Then when I got to the section for error checking, I was told I had errors in my stock sales.  So I did it a forth time, which came out the same as the second and third time.  This time it passed the error checking, but instead of showing that we had purchased the stocks, Turbo Tax showed we had "inherited" the stocks.  I could not get Turbo Tax to change, so I printed out the form scratched out "inherited" and put in the date of purchase.  I would rather do my taxes by hand than use Turbo Tax again
I have been using Turbo Tax for years just as I jave used Quicken for years.  One of the big plusses for me was It's Deductible, a program that places values on items you give to charities and imports directly into Turbo Tax.  It's Deductible was a stand alone program until 2006 when it went to Intuit for online entries.  You could not longer buy the program to install on your PC.  This would have been OK but then Intuit would not allow you to see the values placed on donations until you purchased Turbo Tax.  Intuit thinking of the bottom line rather than the customer.  I hated that and told Intuit my feelings - no response as I expected.  But what the heck, I entered my donations through 2006 and when Turbo Tax 2006 came out I purchased it from Amazon for a good price.After installing Turbo Tax I went to see what my donation values were and to import the values into Turbo Tax from my online entries.  Nope - No can do.  Not only was It's Deductible buried in Turbo Tax with a very clunky and slow link to start the program but there was absolutely no way to import.  After much searching on Intuit's support pages - always a chore - I finally found a page explaining - no import.  But if you like you can get a voucher to unlock the online values and then manually re enter the information into Turbo Tax!  What a crock.  On top of that using It's Deductible and Turbo Tax slows my duo core PC to a crawl.  I will look elsewhere next year
You can try this for free for up to 60 days by registering with Microsoft and downloading an evaluation copy. When you're sure you want it, permanently activate it with the product key you get in your Amazon package.The new version of Excel has two huge advantages:1. It removes the old 256 column/65,536 row limitation.  You can now have 16,384 columns and more than a million rows.  2. Excel 2007 can use all the cores/processors in your computer (or you can restrict it to use only some, so huge background calculations do not tie up your machine).  On my dual core computer, Excel 2007 is **way** faster than 2003 at almost every task.I've seen no crashes, hangs, or hiccups.But everything else about Excel 2007 is frustrating.  The new "ribbon" interface is unnecessary and awkward -- almost every operation takes more pointing and clicking than older releases. Bypassing the ribbon with the new "Quick Access Toolbar" is problematic because (bizarrely) Microsoft has deleted many distinctive command icons, leaving them with identical green circles.Right now Excel 2003 costs more than Excel 2007.  If the two plusses don't help you, you may think that 2003 is worth more
I excitedly upgraded to Office 2007....'07 Outlook is FAR slower - ties my reasonably powerful machine up in knots (110% of resources) for minutes at a time inexplicably; spell ck doesn't work consistently; HTML emails have lost functionality I used to use often with 2003 ver; Excel opens MUCH more slowly; no real gains in Excel fuctionality; various add-ins essential to my biz no longer work in Excel 2007; Access 2007 was billed as much easier to use - FALSE; Word has a couple of improvements but messes up spell ck with Outlook if you keep both Word 2003  2007 on yr machine; the highly touted "Ribbon" is mainly cosmetic; I believe 2007's indexing is at the heart of some of sluggisness which might be ok if it worked..but it retruns strange results....NET, NET, I am uninstalling Office 2007 and going back to 2003 with all its stupid faults....it's too bad no one at MSFT actually uses thier products to realize how defective they are. 
Normally I might wait to install a new software upgrade, but I just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use Office 2007 with the new Vista operating system. I was wrong.You would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software. But after a month of using Office 2007, you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release. Microsoft should be ashamed.I don't know the root cause of my problems, but I have to stress that I am running a clean install of Office 2007 on Vista, so there shouldn't be any software conflicts or issues. So what are my issues? The list is long:-- My biggest concern is that MS Word constantly hangs and stalls. It can making editing a document very painful. I suspect the problem is when I put images or Visio diagrams into a document. But that is something the old MS Word was able to do without an issue. Oddly, if I have a colleague open the document and save it out in Word 2003, the problem goes away! What?! It's killing my productivity.-- When ever I cut and paste from an old document, Word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds. And often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire. I keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things. This never happened in the old Word. This is another time killer.-- Every few days, Outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders. Uh oh! I have to completely restart my computer to see my email again.-- Outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess. It is because Outlook 2007 does NOT render HTML correctly since it uses the Word engine, not Internet Explorer to display email. I have no idea why Microsoft did this, but they have got to fix it.-- Many of the issues in the old Word 2003 still haven't been fixed. If you place an image, it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly. Why can't they solve this one?-- While most Office programs have the new ribbon interface (which I like), some programs like Visio 2007 do not. So you have to remember how to use two interfaces. Couldn't Microsoft find the time and money to update ALL its programs? Give me a break.-- On a few occassions in Visio 2007, my files have failed to save correctly. At first I thought this must have been my fault, but it's happened to me a few times and can't be a coincidence. A few times I've gotten an error message and lost my work. Ug.-- Word and Excel 2007 use a completely new file format. So anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed (which isn't likely the case). To get around this, you can save it down to a 2003 file format, but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format. What a pain! Also, there definitely seems to be an issue with Office 2007 opening older Office 2003 files. Could be the cause of many of my problems, but there is no way I can avoid using old files. They should have worked harder on compatibility.There are good things about the new 2007. I do like the new interface design and the new features in Outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar.But I don't think it's fair that Microsoft released a product so full of serious, serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work. I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and don't think the public should have to suffer. Surely they can afford to do better!NEW ADDITION TO MY REVIEW:Today I discovered that I can no longer paste Excel charts into Word like I used to. When I try, the chart goes in, but any bars/lines disappear. 
I'm good with computers and have used other architectural software, and this was most disappointing.  In fact, if I had not bought this on Amazon, I would have returned it to the local retail store with huge complaints.  It was difficult to install--buggy.  It had problems rendering a drawing and would often lock up.  The "objects" that you pull from its library can sometimes be opened and resized--and sometimes cannot.  Hardly intuitive at all.  Also disappointing was the way multiple stories did not synch up.  I had reasonable expectations for this software, but wish I had bought something else.  For $10 it would be a good purchase.  For anything over that, you are wasting your money.  Try another product, a demo first, or something.  But in my opinion this was a big waste of money
This software is very hard to use. The help video goes too fast, the manual doesn't cover everything and nothing is intuitive. I have used a lot of software and this is just not worth the money
I was so excited to get this! The terrain on our lot has quite a slant to it because we're on a hill. My husband and I thought this would easily help us create a materials list for our retaining walls that we wanted to put out front. Long story short... I spent hours (at least 40) getting the dimensions of our house correct and trying to get the yard right. We even rented a surveying instrument to determine the slope of our yard to input elevation points. MANY hours wasted... the software does not let you set the height of the retaining walls and it inputs random walls and pieces of wall in the 3-D view that you can't get rid of. The flowers are hard to place, they don't end up where you want them.  Besides, the "Plant Chooser" doesn't have hardly any perrenial plants to choose from.  Bottom line: I spent $50 in software costs and $50 for a surveying instrument and ended up having to calculate the wall length and height manually.  If you have a flat lot, this might work well for you.  For anyone that has hills, or slopes to their yard, Good luck!
I work for a software company so I know a little about the user interface concept.  This is one of the worst packages I have ever used.  I just spent an hour trying to draw my house and get the dimensions right.  The automatic dimension builder did not work.  I had to draw it, and redraw it to get the dimensions right.  Then I added a few windows and doors, and 2 porches. Then I tried to use the camera to get a vertical view.  The whole file blew up - can't find it anywhere.  The manual is useless, and the tutorial CD is just an overview of each topic.  What a waste of moeny
Do not waste your money!  I consider myself pretty computer savvy, but this software is not easy to use.  You'd have an easier time just drawing out your ideas by hand. 
This is the worst software I have ever worked with, everything is difficult and some things are impossible to create.
I have moderate knowledge of computers, etc. and I found this overly complicated.  This is not intended for the novice.  However, even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money.  I wish I had not bought it at all.  Perhaps it has secrets and treasures I am not aware of...but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them.  Save your money...this was a waste
This product is an absolute piece of junk. Do not buy this product. Will not even load properly onto computer. Have wasted several hours trying to install product on windows XP platform with no success. I have wasted a whole day trying to install this piece of junk on my computer, now I will probably waste another day trying to return this bunch of garbage to the vendor.
This game can get very boring. It's very confusing and hard to control. It is sooooo frustrating!!!!!!!!! The instruction booklet doesn't come in handy either. Like some other people, I only got rabbits too. I bought this game because I wanted to heal cats and horses. But, only rabbits came. Buying this game was a big mistake. It is reallly no fun. Don't waste your money on this game. I gave up about a month ago. I've left it on the shelf and haven't touched it since. 
When I got this game, I was very excited to play it. But when I played it, I was very dissapointed. The game was very confusing, and hard to control. Sometimes, I couldn't get my person to go where I wanted it to go. Learn from my mistake. Don't waste your money on this game.
I got this game because I thought it would be fun. I was totally wrong! Every customer that I got brought only rabbits. Rabbits, rabbits, rabbits!!! This game confused me a lot. Also, it gets very boring. And, it's very hard to control. Don't waste your money on this game! It will be a total waste of your money. Believe me
Conceptually this is a great game, especially for a child with visions of being a Vet. You (can theoretically) learn about animals, their care and health issues. Those 2 stars for overall are basically for the concept and little else.Unfortunately the general usability of this game, vis--vis lousy controls, is quite low. It's nearly impossible to move the character at times, which results in stressful failure in the game. It crashes. It can't remember simple settings like, leave the terribly loud and obnoxious music off. Playing this multiple times with my 6 year old always goes from excitement to frustration (bordering on tears more than once as a bunny gets woefully ill while your character is comically stuck bouncing between the sofa and ottoman).  Once going you can engage your child by "studying" the books you've bought. Also, as you analyze the patients you learn about ailments as well as the treatments. That is all good stuff, but on whole the game is too frustrating to enjoy. One final note, this is the first time I've ever bothered to review any product.
I was very excited to get this game.  I did read previously written reviews. My 13 yr old daughter wants to become a veterinarian someday and loves spending time on the computer, so this just seemed like the perfect Christmas gift.  Alas, the game has many faults that does interfere with the game being enjoyable!  I should have listened to the reviews.....The game is extremely glichy!  It makes playing it very hard and frustrating.  My daughter tried for one week and has given up.  The characters get stuck and just stand and vibrate on the screen until you start the game over.  Sometimes she will play for a half hour before it starts up and sometimes it does this right away.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.  Also, some internal setup issues of the actual CD is that it works better running from the disk then saving it to the computers hard drive.  We have a pretty new computer, we have windows XP - this program just doesn't run well off our computer anyway.  We have other games that don't have this problem. In fact my son got a game - building machines and inventions - and it doesn't have any of these problems and actually requires more from my hard drive.Also, my daughter complains of some of the limitations within pet vet that don't allow her to change.  You have to pay a specified amount to hire an employee and the employee in this game is a slouch - there are no other choices when hiring staff, no wage choices, you can't get this employee to work or and you cannot hire anyone else.  Overall because of the gliches in the game, she hasn't been able to play it to the programs full potential and has given up....so the idea is great.. but the makers should have looked at this better before taking the consumers money and putting it on the market.  I cannot find any fixes or downloads online to repair it either.  BIG BUMMER!!!  BEWARE!  JUST DON'T BUY THIS ONE, LOOK ELSEWHERE
After being greeted with much excitement, this program wouldn't properly install on my not-so-fussy computer.  The web assistance was of little help at all and we had to send it back.  Very disappointing
I am a retired senior software engineer (web development).  I've used many antivirus/malware packages both at work and at home.  This is the ABSOLUTE WORST.  After installing it, I got popup virus alerts from BitDefender every 10 seconds.  No kidding.  I couldn't believe it.  I previously had a copy of Norton AntiVirus 5 on my computer which is highly reliable (not like the latest version).  I tried BitDefender based on the reviews below which were obviously written by people with less than standard operating systems.  I use a PC with Windows XP SP2 and IE6 (IE7 is still buggy).  Although multiple runs of BitDefender show absolutely no viruses or malware on my system, I continue to get these popup "virus alerts" every 10 seconds when I browse the internet, which is way more irritating than anything Norton ever did to my computer.  In addition, it drags my computer to almost a screeching halt when I go to a web page I haven't been to in more than a day, sometimes even the ones I just went to an hour ago.  I find this truly irritating and went to BitDefender's website and tried their online chat.  "Jack" was completely worthless.  He told me to completely wipe out my cookies, as well as a lot of other useful files for no apparent reason other than he's probably not named Jack, but something like Vishnu and this was the first thing on a long list of things to tell people to do.  Very useless.  Not recommended for anyone.  Try to get an old copy of Norton Antivirus 5 and pay for the update feature ($20 per year).  Much better than this garbage.  In addition, there are virtually no options to customizing this product.  You're stuck with what they think is necessary (like automatically deleting internet files you may need--like shopping carts).  It literally cripples your computer.  
I made the unfortunate mistake of reading fantastic reviews for this product and trying it out myself.  I went online and purchased the program, downloaded, and installed on my pc.  Installation worked perfectly. I ran a scan and it even found viruses that Mcafee missed. However, any program that used the internet now freezes or takes forever to load. After closing web browsers I have to restart before my PC recovers.  I unistalled the program and now everything works great.  I'm shopping somewhere else for my Antivirus needs
I'd give this no stars but it won't let me.Why would anyone buy this? I was in Compusa today as they are closing down on Long Island  thought about buying this. I put it down  said I will researh this more at home. As I suspected, you can go to [...]  do the same thing that this software does. The software doesn't allow you to print stamps at home so what's the point? The only plus is that you get a sheet of free stamps, so it's like buying a [...] coupon, that's a one time use. I don't get it
I brought the software beleiving that it would help me with my scrapbooking.  It has very limited graphics and templates to workwith.  I would not recomend this software package.  Also the journaling sucks as well.  Even when you start a product from scratch the software isn't user friendly with very little guidence. As stated before 1 star is to much. 
Complete waste of money.  I purchased my copy at Wal-Mart but wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake I did.  The graphics and templates they use on the package to lure you in are nice and tasteful.  The actaul program is SO not like that.  The graphics are down right cheesy, and low budget.  Having only paid $9 for this program, I feel like I was completely ripped off.  I'll for sure be calling the company and asking for a refund. 1 star seems like too many to give this awful item
This software is a waste of money to say the least. The templates on this software are terrible and ugly. You are lucky if you have five good templates to choose from. If you are looking for something quick and easy to use this is not it.You have to format everything. Please don't make the same mistake I made. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
If you read the license, you find that you probably give away rights to anything you use in a comic book.  It also looks like you can't give away copies of comics you print, certainly can't sell them, and can't let others copy them.  Unless you want your child's face on a cereal box without your permission, you probably don't want this software
This program is limited to a few word bubbles and sound effect fonts.It is difficult for a novice to understand how to get his or her own pictures into the comic. The word bubble sdo not rotate, so they could be pointing anywhere except where you want them to.It looks really great on the cover of the CD, and that's what sold me.It was a disapointing christmas
Once again QuickBooks dangles promises to us Mac folk that just don't add up. If you're like me, your accountant and bookkeeper are on Windoz - that's why I was psyched when I thought I would really be able to share my Mac QB files with them, and vice-versa. Mistake #1 - I give my bookkeeper a backup from QB 2006 before I updated to 2007. BIG mistake. QB is not backward compatable. So when my bookkeper sent the file back to me in Mac format, (after spending hours updating it), I was not able to import it into QB 2007. To me, this is nuts. But the helpful tech person we spoke with, suggested that even if it had been '07 this sharing business between Mac and Windows versions is sort of a one time deal. This wasn't intended to be a back and forth thing, between Mac and Windows. Huh? So what's the point?  Here's my work-around: I bought a used XP box on eBay and am trading my Mac '07 for Windoz '07.
We have used QuickBooks on a PC since the 1990's.  We loved the way Inuit made accounting accessible for people without degrees in accounting.  QuickBooks for Mac is TERRIBLE in comparison.  If you plan to use the payroll features, it is unusable.  QuickBooks Mac payroll redirects you to the internet, where it is handled by PayCycle (an independent company).  Payroll is not integrated at all in the Mac (instead import/export operation). On the PC, it is part of the QuickBooks application.  We could not get job costing to work, and the tax calculations made no sense.  We were paying TONS of money to PayCycle, so fortunately the taxes were filed automatically.  We finally reverted back to QuickBooks for Windows and are MUCH happier with Intuit handling our payroll
I imported from Quicken for Mac to Quickbooks Pro for Mac and after 3 weeks of trying to make the result work, I gave up. The interface is far less intuitive than in Quicken (for example, entering vendor names by typing the first letters then scrolling through the choices with the arrow keys as in Q) does not work in QB, forcing one to guess at the exact vendor name the first time; and the imported names and addresses do not go automatically to vendors if they have been paid, and customers if they provide payments; rather they all go to an 'other names' list that, with a thousand or two names in it, cannot be simply dragged to the  correct list; rather each one has to be edited individually. When I started forming invoices and quotes for customers, I found that QB would forget the customer's address, sometimes including it and other times yielding a blank field. Also the field lengths in QB are often shorter than in Q, resulting in incomplete import of memo fields. In addition, export capabilities are negligible; one can only export transactions and other details in a proprietary format that can't be used elsewhere, unlike Q which exports in a readable and massageable format. Overall it seems that QB has been written by a different company than Q, and to a large extent the programs are not compatible even though the import from Q to QB appears at first viewing to work OK. It is better to start a new financial year with new software and enter all data in again by hand rather than try to make QB use Q data, in my view. I have switched to MYOB AccountEdge at a rather higher cost, and find that this clean start at the financial year beginning works OK for me. The MYOB product is a little clunkier than QB with more fields to fill in and numbered accounts all over the place, and its Q import is a total joke (with repeated questions on where to allocate accounts for each transaction without an explanation screen) so that import of any more than 10 transactions becomes laughable) but its export abilities are wonderful and I think its inventory control is better than QB; also, it has not yet lost invoice addresses the way QB did on me. One has to input addresses in fields before memorizing tranactions however otherwise the memorized transactions in MYOB don't update. I have found that MYOB is about as intuitive as Q when it comes to entry of payee fields etc; while QB has lost that data entry ease entirely. QB may have an advantage if your goal includes payroll however; MYOB seems to have a pretty sad service unless you are prepared to pay all of the taxes yourself.
When I considered purchasing this product, I was confused to see that some people thought it was great, and others thought it was terrible.  I couldn't understand why there were such discrepancies in the reviews.After I bought it I understood: For some of the things it does, it works fine -- no problems.  However, there are many major bugs in the software, and if you need one of the buggy functions, you'll be sorry you bought it.Examples of some problems: 1. If you burn an audio track entitled "Blue Fog" Nero will give it the title "Fog."2. Every time I run a backup, it tells me there was a write error, but the backup seems OK.3. I backed up every file on my drive, but when my system crashed, there were problems that prevented me from restoring my system.4. It has blue screened my system one time.5. Many commands are poorly or not at all documented.  For example, the wave editor has a declipper function, but there is no documentation on how to use it.So, I'd recommend that you look instead at a competing product.Good luck
This is very BAD---doesnot work and really interfers with other programs. Almost impossible to remove it.
I could be home in bed. But I'm Fing around trying to undo the install of the biggest mistake I've made to date...purchasing, tossing money in the toilet for Nero7. The damage and the time it's taken to recover is about 20 times it's cost. Useless. I can't copy a disk. I can't burn and image. What's the deal??? All the negative stuff I've read true. Unfortunately AFTER I paid for Nero7 BEFORE reading what others have to say. What really puzzles me is who all the folks are that are writing all the wonderful reviews? Employees of Ahead? Keep your distance or you'll be sorry
Nero 7 wants to prevent you from generating ISO files and instead wants you to use its NRG CD backup file system. Then it doesn't want you to burn WAV onto CD but forces you to invest in MP3 encryption so that you can burn MP3 to CD. The software is full of these horrible twists that Nero has gone from the best burning rom to the worst burning rom by simply making it harder for you to do what you want. I rolled back to Nero 5.5 and had a fully functional and top of the line burning rom again
This software suite promises to do everything on earth, but doesn't tell us how.  There is no useful help file.  There are no tutorials or instructions on the website.  And, Nero's support is a joke (just try to get a message through).  I don't understand how a company that started out with the best burn program in the game has sunk to this
This product is worse than useless.  Right off the bat, the tutorials do not behave as depicted.  What is left does not run properly.  I spent hours and hours trying to make a CD from an LP, all to no avail.To make matters worse, this bug infested monstrosity, has very poor support.  There is no 800 number.  The version that I had came with 10 days of tecnical assistance that was useless!  After the 10 days, technical assistance costs $1.29 a minute, plus the cost of the long distance call!I REPEAT!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! 
Ever since Adobe bought out this small operation, customer service has been severely lacking.  Software will NOT work on Excel 2007.   The promise for additional POWERLOOKS has become dead.  Granted that the program makes presentation more interesting, the Powerlooks that was in production are no longer on the website.  This is highly disappointing as I purchased this program in anticipation for further development on the Powerlook templates. 
First, I should have listened to my instincts and downloaded the trial version BEFORE purchasing.  Had I done this I would HAVE NEVER purchased this product.  As it is, having bought the product from a box store and NOT online, I made a $99.00 mistake, plus tax.  The product has too many limitations to be considered as a viable add-on to your powerpoint presentations.  As a presenter, using PPT every week, in training presentations, I can tell you that this product does more to limit PPT's slide producing capabilities than it does to add to them.  As a matter of fact, I found the product to "take away" from PPT's slide building procedures, NOT "add" to them.  Save your money and wait for the next PPT add-on to come along.  This product is worth neither your investigative time, nor your monetary investment
I use PowerPoint a great deal as a teacher and thought this would upgrade my presentations. Unfortunately, every one of my computers had insufficient video memory to allow the software to work. For now, it sits on my shelf until I can purchase more powerful equipment. Certainly not for the casual user. It isn't the magic black box that will make you a star
They changed pretty much everything. For starters they completely removed all of the normal menus such as File, Tool, and Edit. Which means you can't use the keyboard for quick and easy menu access. Well maybe you can, but you would have to memorize all of the commands instead of having the nice little visual cues which made previous versions of Office (and almost all other PC programs) so much easier to use. You basically have to use the mouse for everything. And in my experience there is no faster way to repetitive stress injury than over-mousing.The Ribbon is just awful. First of all it's huge. It takes up about FOUR TIMES the space of my customized toolbar. They place nearly every button imaginable on it. And as far as I can tell you can't change it around or simplify it. Every function is displayed all the time whether you need it or not. Which makes finding anything a real pain in the neck. You can make the ribbon retract which at first glance seems nice. But in reality it turns what used to be simple 1-click operations into 3-click operations (extend ribbon, spend several minutes searching for button, click button, retract ribbon). Good grief! What a pain.This software didn't last 24 hours on my system before I restored my old version of Office. This new interface is about the most awful thing I've ever seen on a computer. I know of certain free open source office suites that I prefer to this monstrosity. That being said I still prefer any and all previous versions of MS Office to the free one. In fact I would rather be using my old Wordperfect from 1995 than this *thing* that MS is trying to shove down our throats. If only I hadn't thrown that disc away six years ago...Before you "invest" your money in this software I strongly recommend you download the free trial version. Then buy an earlier version
You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have. Don't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it. Many changes are literally imposed on you, like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars. Missing menus and the auto-double space setting every time you hit return. There are new features which can be helpful to some, but Microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining. The arrogance of Microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible. You upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual.  
Far from user-friendly, you will be at the office later at night tearing out your hair trying to find the buttons on the tool bar for even the simplest of office tasks, wondering "Why did I get this program again?" Its like reading another language after using previous editions of Word, which I was a big fan of. I guess with some extensive getting used to the it might be nice but for now it's a nuisance. I can't find anything on this toold bar that looks like an airplane cockpit. In the words of Thoreau "Simplify."Good luck sending files as attachments to colleagues-they won't be able to view the newere version. Get used to saving in "97-2003 Word Format." Also, won't comply with other programs such as e-fax unless saved in this manner. At this price, you could do without the headache.
I am an experienced Office user.  I recently updgraded from Office 2003 (which worked great) to Office 2007 and now I am much less productive.Office 2007 is pretty but if you actually have to get something done at work  DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT
We are very disappointed in this product because it provides almost no options to customize the spreadsheet.  We cannot rename catagories that are not applicable to us (i.e., child care), and we cannot create new categories that are specific to our needs.  What's even more limiting and disppointing is that you cannot create a different tab for each month to use for comparison, which makes us wonder what value we gain from having a single month of finances captured.  Finally, the bar graphs for summary comparisons are shaded the same color of the background which makes it very difficult to read
I have used Norton Virus Protection and Norton Internet Security for several years. I am currently running NIS 2006. My experience with these products has not been good but out of fear I just renewed my subscription. Since then I have had nothing but trouble with NIS. Since my renewal is within the grace period I decided to request a refund. I tried to do this on-line but found it an impossible waste of effort. Their web site and support are as useless as their product. From Norton Internet Security I clicked on support linked to their web site. Once there, I tried to apply for a refund but their system did not recognize my subscription renewal order number.  It did recognize my product order number for NIS 2006 but that is not refundable so no help there. I gave up on requesting a refund and decided to contact support. If you click on "contact us" There are 2 options, Telephone or Email. Telephone support was down because of an earthquake in Taiwan. I decided to try email. I clicked on email and got the following security alert: There is a problem with this website's security certificate.The security certificate presented by this website has expired or is not yet valid.Security certificate problems may indicate an attempt to fool you or intercept any data you send to the server.

I know I was on their site because I navigated there by clicking on support in NIS. You would think an internet security company could maintain their own security certificates. I'm not surprised though because everything Symantec does is designed to make you hate them. Their product is abysmal. It bogs my system down to a crawl, disrupts the performance of other applications and hogs system resources. If you put NIS on your computer you'd better get used to staring at the hourglass icon for long periods of time, Especially if you don't have tons of virtual memory and hard disk space available. Nortons CCapp retards start up forever and won't shut down when you want to log off. Recently I had to reinstall my windows xp operating system. After that I had major problems with NIS and had to uninstall it. It was then I realized how much better my system ran without it. I had already paid my renewal fee so I downloaded and reinstalled NIS and have had nothing but trouble since. I tried to leave feedback on Symantecs web site but typical of them, that does not work either. I wrote a long complaint, then clicked on submit. An error message came up saying to go back and correct the highlighted areas. When I clicked the back button all the text I had typed in was gone... just because I had failed to enter a subject line in the feedback report. I'll be damned if I was about to type all that information back in again. If you buy NIS you'd better hope it works the first time. If you think your going to get good support from Symantec or anything out of their website - think again. Oh, and BTW Beware, Symantec enrolls you for automatic renewal unless you go to their website and un-enroll. Once they have your money just try to get it back. Symantec sets up road blocks so you eventually just give up in frustration. This is how they make their money rather than by making a good product.
I have been using Norton Anti-Virus since I purchased the Compaq Presario 4000. The reason I have stuck with Norton because this Presario came with Norton Internet Security 2002 attached to it. I never used the NIS 2002, though, but I purchased the Norton Anti-Virus (NAV) 2003 which I have bee using for the last three years. In fact I used the NAV 2004 for two straight years without any response from Symantec, then all of a sudden that subscription was eventually retired by Symantec. I liked the NAV 2005 (which Symantec six months prior to its due date subscription, which made me mad and hence my wanting to try NIS at a subsidized rate) because like NAV 2003, it could tell if someone or something was trying to intrude into your computer. It is after purchasing and trying NIS 2005, that I realized how low and base Norton can go with its software. First when I tried NIS 2005, it blocked all my websites. I couldnt access them and I could not read my e-mail (Whenever I tried to read my e-mail, the response would be that, that action has been cancelled). So I reformatted my hard drive and the NIS 2005 appeared to be working quite well until I tred to install Adobe Reader 7.08 and couldn't allow me to proceed. Moreover, it was snail slow in allowing me to read one mail to another. So I uninstalled NIS 2005 and installed NAV 2006, which appears to be working well. I have now purchased Tend Micro PC-cillin 2006 as well as McAfee Viruscan 2006 at subsidized rates, should Symantec pematurely terminate my NAV 2006 prematurely i.e. before the 366 days of subscription are over. I think one of the reasons why NIS could not work is that it is a program that it is trying to do more than it can chew. It tried to be an anti-virus, personal firewall, privacy control, antispam as well as parental control in one. It reminds of the days when it was better to purchase a cassette player separate from  the radio, since the technology at that time could not produce a good combined raio cassette player. I think Norton Internet Security is in that mode. It is not yet competent to produce a combined solution that is both antivirus and anti spam,anti-spyware at the same time. Hence the many complaints of its being a buggy program. At this stage, I would stay away from any program that calls itself "Internet Security." I may try Trend Micro internet Security which has received rave reviews from a couple of its users, but that will be if something goes wrong with my current NAV 2006. Otherwise, I am still wary of those programs that pass off as "Internet Security" such as "Norton Internet Security" or "Trend Micro Internet Security," pending their perfection of this technology at some future date
Okay... so I'm not as astute in the technical aspects of software as some reviewers, but I can say that my experience with this software is absolutely terrible.First off, it is built to integrate with Outlook, but doesn't really. It always leaves one e-mail in your outbox (the one you posted first). If you open your outbox before they send, then the one you posted most recently won't send either. Seriously, the only way I have been dealing with this is that I have left a dead e-mail in the box permanently. If I need to change something that has been posted to the outbox, I have to open it, then get out of the outbox, change it, and repost it, otherwise it won't send -- ever.I have set NIS so that it doesn't scan my outgoing e-mail, as it blocks anything over 2mb, and in my business, I send things that big all the time. In a recent update, however, it has reinstated that and now scans all of my outgoing e-mail whether it is set to or not.I spent hours and hours on the phone with (supposed) technicians, who refused to answer any questions unless I disabled my whole network. What that has to do with this program, I don't know. I tried the "live internet chat" function, but -- and I kid you not -- it took almost two hours for me to get ten responses from the guy. When I complained, he hung up on me. Gotta love that.When I tell NIS that something it has categorised as spam "isn't spam", it doesn't remember the sender's e-mail address, like it is supposed to. It just keeps calling it spam and quarantining it. Regarding spyware, I have another piece of anti-spyware software called Webroot Spy Sweeper, that routinely finds spyware on my computer that NIS didn't catch. This has just been one headache after another. Their customer service was unresponsive and totally unhelpful, with not ONE actual solution to any of these problems.The only piece of software I have ever bought that was anywhere close to as bad as this is WinFax 10, another Norton product.I will NEVER, EVER buy another piece of Norton/Symantec software again as long as I live. They should be ashamed of themselves
(this review is of the Spyware edition)NIS takes 25Megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one (if you have 256Megs your lightweight CPU can't carry enough armor to make Windows really Zero-day Net safe IMHO)NIS has most of the features I look for in a firewall/spyware/virus scanner/intrusion detector, BUT half don't work right, and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work.Even after LiveUpdate this week,One buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded, and port 80 was open listening half 'naked' on the Internet.I replaced it, and at the first passing probe my rule was erased, autoreplaced, naked again.Only after I stumbled onto the secret trick (add a block all rule after the pass rules) did it close it.It took 11 clicks (!) just to add the block all rule - miserable!The log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining "permitted once" 200 times, no actual info	until I click on one of them. What's worse is, none of them I checked WERE "permitted once" IIRC.NIS detected 2 trojan/spywares, but could not remove either.Enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups, all suggesting I block access, but I actually DO want IE to access the internet. Running Windows update brought a popup asking if 100's more dll's are ok. How would I know? I do want Windows updated. Great feature in theory, totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented.If you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset, plan to either "permit all" or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand TCP vs UDP etc. Why no "permit all local + DNS + outbound port 80" choice? That would mean 1/10 the work! Jetico lets me pick "web browser" ruleset, so its UI from Hell gets used once per category.After spending all day and half the night getting it working, I discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them. I would be less furious if I had a fresh install of windows, but not much.All good, until a program autoupdates, and 3 more rules to write. Too angry for words.Jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig.I would not use NIS if you paid me 10 times its price.
The Good- This software completely locks down email access, internet access, network access etc.The Bad - This software completely locks down email access, internet access, network access etc.  The UGLY.  I bought a new notebook I was going nuts trying to figure out why Outlook wouldn't send/receive emails, my wireless connection wouldn't work, why new software I was installing wouldn't update over the web, it was taking 5-10 minutes JUST TO RESTART THE COMPUTER!!! Hmmm all these issues started after installing Internet Security 2005.To be fair I said ok, better make sure I have this set up right...So I took a step back, went to Symantec's site and spent time learning to properly configure the settings, software etc.  Ok great, my bad right?  Wrong.  When I tried adding Comcast's server addresses to the trusted list NIS 2005 would freeze up, I would have to reboot, and 10min later the same thing. To make a long story short, I would not reccomend this product for anyone with less than 110% of patience and complete understanding of the product installation and set up.  The best thing about NIS 2005 was it only took 5 minutes to uninstall.
I have always used Norton antivirus, and had no problems with it at all. I have recently had to migrate to Outlook 2003 and Norton IS 2005 and have non-stop system crashes. I have now uninstalled it and resinstalled my old version of Norton Professional and hey presto everything is working again - and not talking two hours to load.
I have always used the other well-known office suites in the past but when I received an offer on this suite at a significant discount, I thought I would try it.  I should mention I'm a doctoral student in the middle of a dissertation, so the challenge was to migrate important data and documents into WordPerfect and Quattro Pro.  While I was able to get it done the Quattro Pro interface with SPSS, which had worked seemlessly with the other spreadsheet, failed horribly.  Not to mention the complicated details of what should be simple document formatting--the Visual Basic Editor kept freezing or denying me access.Invest in a better product if you have serious work.  I've gone back to the benchmark office suite product
Quicken software continues to contain prominent advertising for Intuit products and services.  In my opinion, it is fine to offer additional services to customers, but give the customer the opportunity to say "no thanks" and then leave them alone so they can be productive with the software.  Forever pestering a paid customer with advertising for the same products and services is not a good idea.  Advertising takes up space in the user interface and is a distraction that reduces productivity
I've only had this software for a few months and already know half of the tech support population of Bangalore, India. One problem with this software is that it has an auto update function that results in "Patch Engine Error," which I've solved through versions 2, 3 and 4. Another problem is with Quicken's servers, resulting in CC-501, CC-502 and CC-899 errors. Translation: Quicken's servers are unable to reliably update your bank account information. Today, in the time it took Pandeep to respond to one of my online chat questions, I was able to migrate a dozen accounts to MSN's free online version of Money, which updated all of my bank accounts easily. Conclusion: Save your receipt for their 60-day refund
I have been a long time user and have always had good success until the 2007. I have tried to install on my new PC and have not been successful. I called Intuit Phone support and spent and hour changing setting on my computer. We did the usual things for WinXP Pro:1. Set up a new account to verify it isn't a permission problem2. Shut off all service and switched to safe modeNone of these made a difference. So the Support Technician told me to call Microsoft and then hung up. That was it, no chance to even complain, just a dead phone line.Luckly, I know enough to put my PC back in worki9ng order but this is pretty lame support. I never though Microsoft would get me to switch and they haven't but Intuit has forced me off all on their own.
From my experience just about all support calls are routed off shore.Most of the tech support staff just take your question and type it into their work station. They say "May I put you on hold while I check my resources". Then they read answers off their screen. Several times I had to say to the tech - I can't understand your English. If you buy the package I'd find a local QB certified accountant and pay him/her for their time.
When converting my 2005 data over to 2006 version it lost all of my time data.  I have to rebuild my datafile just to use the check register now.  Also the new program will not allow me to add a vendor or a customer.  I've had to change names and addresses of obsolete customers and vendors just to add new ones.Intuit's support sucks and cannot seem to resolve my problems.  I have two copies on two different computers and am having the same problems with my data file on each computer.  My recommendation is if you are using the 2005 version, and don't need tax tables, don't mess with 2006 version.  It has literally cost me thousands of dollars of my time trying to work out the bugs on my own
The res on the artwork here is less than miserable. The interface is high-tech circa 1996. I'm dissappointed in this purchase. I would have thought it was fantastic when I bought my first PC in 1993
I've installed and tested this for several clients.  Whether backing up to a local HD or over the network, the system has worked; I install and come back a week later to do a test verify and restore, and it's always worked.  I did have trouble once; Windows froze up.  This was probably due to poor programming combined with insufficient RAM; it worked the second time.I don't get why a product with mostly single star ratings like this still gets 2.5 stars.  Annoying Amazon 'feature'!Since 60% of Windows PCs are malware-infected, I'm figuring most Windows PC support issues are malware-induced. 
It's a piece of junk, so save your money and some headaches. Even Dell technicians can't fix it.   My new Dell computer had Norton Ghost pre-installed with a back-up hard drive just for cloning.  It sounded like a perfect setup except my Norton Ghost wouldn't work.  Contacted Dell three times and they supposedly coordinated with Norton to no avail.  Now I'm stuck with saturated backup hard drive that is useless to me
I bought this product to assist in recovery, but I tried to recover a program and it would not work. Does real well on a complete recovery but do not expect a partial. Works well on recovery of My stuff
I should have listened to the other reviewers...  I wanted to replace my C: drive with a faster one, and Ghost 10.0 says it can do it, but don't be fooled.  Even if you follow the extra steps from their support site (which are not in the documentation), you will end up with an unusable copy that will boot up but then fail with assorted catastrophic errors.It will also give you occasional error messages that are neither in the documentation nor on their support site.A friend recommended Acronis TrueImage which I ended using instead.  It's much easier to use, copies about 2x faster than Ghost, and best of all it works.  I cloned and replaced C drives from two laptops in a couple of hours with no problems. 
Don't waste your time and money!! EXTREMELY poor product support! 60 day return policy which they exploit by trying to solve your problems and delaying past the 60 day limit, then you're stuck with worthless software.I installed it on my computer making a complete backup of it. Then my computer crashed and I lost everything. I thought I was covered since I just made a full backup on an external hard disk but when I tried to do a restore Norton Ghost wouldn't recognize my external hard disk.I spent a full day with their support people and he finally gave up telling me he had to send the problem to the next level of support and that they would call me within 48 hours. Nobody called!I bought their Extended Download service and tried to download the product again. It didn't work and after spending 8 hours online and on the phone I still haven't got a working copy. The product key they said I needed and I tried to use also doesn't work. I'm writing my credit card company next to try and get a credit but I expect the same result - NO credit back and software that doesn't do what Norton said it would do
I got Norton Ghost with my new Dell PC, so I thought I would use it for backups to an external USB drive. After about 6 months of 'trying' to use it, I finally gave up and uninstalled it. Reason, most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it. Twice I removed all the partial backups and started from scratch, but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup.Now, the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image, but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups
I have used this procuct in the past with great success, but Ghost 10 is useless. Symantec tech support is (as far as I can tell, been doing computers since 1957) the worst. If you get the Boxed version It says PC Magzine September 2004 "Belongs in every serious PC user's toolbox."  Think about it using a 2004 quote. In 2004 and 2005 I would agree.  The 1st sys I installed Ghost 10 is a Dell XPX600, Boot disk will not work, BackUp will not work, blue screen when backing up.Tech support directed me to web sites that don't exist, and the sites that did come up didn't have the files NU tech listed.  Dell Workstations 530 and 360 both dual processor, no games, 15,000 Scsi Raid, 4GB mem, 1GB nVidia, Dual Displays -- They Crashed and had to be reformated and reinstalled. System works 2005 expired I couldn't use my Ghost 9 backups, and I kept getting virus pop ups that were generated by NU, the systems were shipped to Panama and were in Customs for over 6 mo this is not a usual event in the life of a computer, but with no tech support and my computers only starting long enough to tell me Sys Works was not up to date I reformated. I purchased (in anticipation of setting up my computers) boxed from Amazon and download from NU Ghost 10,Sys Wrks prem, NU int sec (2007 versions) but couldn't install them. That was Mid December 2006, now its January 19, 2007 and still not one answer from NU that works, yes all systems are pluged in to  TrippLite Smart3000RMU  TrippLite line condidtoners (2 Batery Backup Units), the computers lived in ST Maarten and the power was 105 to 140 volts with lots of downtime.Panama weather, people, public offices are great (Driver lic $24 Lic plates $30 for 3 years, St Maarten driver lic $450 for 2 years, Lic plates $400 yr) sailing is better in ST Maarten. Life in Panama ( and I don't speek Spanish yet )is good Norton is bad. l read a lot mostly tech books, I purchase tools, electronic gear, software, computer hardware, etc without Amazon it would be hard to live offshore,no need to go to Borders, Amazon is online 24 7.
This CD should be priced at $5.00. The graphics will not keep your child's attention and it's pretty lame. It was a wasted purchase, I have to bribe my child to use it, because it so boring
I bought this for my two sons, ages 6 and 8, to help them develop speed with their memory math skills.  What a disappointment.  Even when they do know the answer quickly it can take them a good minute to find the actual answer in the game.  Each playtime you must start from the beginning a work back up to where you left off.  Good for review but it takes so long to get to the levels where practice is really needed.  I wish I'd purchased a different product
This concept is good but the user interface and playability is terrible.  My 7-year old was frustrated with being forced to use the keyboard and no mouse.  And we couldn't figure out a way to go back to the main menu without exiting the game.  And playing a later level requires you to go through all the earlier levels.  And...did they actually test this thing on humans?  What a waste of potential.  It is a good concept
My son had an earlier version of Math Blaster, it was wonderful.  I saw this new version and expected more of the same.  WRONG!!  After 10 minutes of loud sounds, and pulsing video, he was complaining.  It was impossible to focus on what he should do with all the distracting background stuff. Never could get to a point where learning might take place.  Wish I could get my money back.  After this disaster, we purchased Mia's Math Adventure. This was more in tune with the first Math Blaster. 
I just got a 2006 version of math blasters, I played it for a while and I thought that it was really frustrating and it didnt help me at math at all! I think that anyone who plays it will probably fall right to sleep when they start playing! The box it came in said it was for age 6-12 but I think it is for 6 or 7 year old kids. I really dont think this is a good game to play
This is THE BEST SELLING Bible in America for good reason! Ease of comprehension, lovely modern English, pleasing packaging, and the best conservative scholarhip for both textual reconstruction and language translation.Read I WAS A TEENAGE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS and JEHOVAH UNMASKED for two of the wildest rides ever!
If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support
We purchased this software to map retail locations on a region.  It is missing too many features to be usable.  For instance, when you import a custom graphic pushpin, the software doesn't resize it as you zoom which forces you to create multiple sizes in another program.  You can add text description boxes but have no control over the font or sizing -- and they don't resize either.  We highlighted our specific region but the software doesn't let you print just that region (called 'territory.)  We searched the help files and their word 'territory' is not even listed.You cannot save your map graphics in any standard graphics format, e.g. JPEG, PDF or ai.  We tried printing to a PDF generator, but Map Point's map output is of very poor resolution even on the highest settings.After wasting a lot of time, it's apparent we should have tried Google Maps/Earth with our graphics editing software for a solution that works
If you buy this be sure to set a Restore Point before installing. This may work if you have never installed any other Anti-Virus software. This is not for a novice computer user to install unless maybe you are installing on a brand new computer.After uninstalling Norton (my previous anti virus software)I installed Kapersky and immediately had total system lockup with warning message from Windows (the old blue screen of death) saying a serious problem had occurred and if I had recently installed new hardware or software to uninstall it.  Which I did, then logged onto the Kapersky forum and was told to download a Norton Removal tool and run it and then reinstall.  I did this and still ended up with total lockup and warning message.  After three tries I gave up.  Luckily I had set Restore points and was able to get my system back and am now back to using Norton.  According to the forum there are also problems if you have installed McAfee.  I am running Windows XP.  Since I never got to use it I can't judge whether it has any value. 
I have this program on a 30-day demo.  It might be OK if I didn't mind my computer becoming almost unusable.I tried to run the system virus scan, as recommended, but after 3 hours it was only 2% done because it was stuck on a file it couldn't seem to get past.  I skipped the file, but then it quickly got stuck again.  The "time remaining" said it would take 4 days to complete, so I cancelled that scan.It has a learning mode that initally blocks EVERYTHING.  Apparently, this program has no brain.  For example, I have the Live Search Toolbar installed in Outlook.  It had to ask me if it was OK to run that dll file.  In fact, each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run.Don't even get me started on the Quickbooks and Internet Explorer problems.  Which is what it wouldn't let those programs do, even after they had been run and I repeated clicked "allow" over and over.Twice today it got so slow running IE that it finally crashed the computer so bad that  I had to do a hard re-boot.  If you have it checking ports on your computer, almost nothing would run or download on IE.So, I'm going to demo a few more, but it's probably back to Windows Live OneCare, which I had the past year.  It just doesn't seem to do much (no long list of features), but it also doesn't jam everthing else up
If I could give it 0 star, I would. My humble opinion is that Kaspersky is not better than Norton at slowing down your computer. One brand new computer, plenty of space and memory. One old computer but with plenty of space and memory as well. Each time Kaspersky updates, I can't open Outlook Express nor Explorer. Well, the programs do open actually but I have time to vacuum and dust before they're launched. I used the repair fonction and uninstalled and reinstalled without any improvement.Samwis
After researching a few options on the market I tried Kaspersky Internet Security Suite 6.0. I needed only anti-virus but since the rebates made the whole suite cost the same as anti-virus alone I decided to give it a try. Man, I was really disappointed. Out of 7 programs only 2 started and have been working properly: anti-virus and proactive defense. The suite was trying to start other 5 programs and was requesting to reboot laptop constantly. After trying all I could I decided to call or email for help. And this is where I got my surprise - none of the contact information led me to any LIVE person. I emailed to all addresses available on the net and in the program. I called all US numbers I could - they even don't have a live representative here. If you try to call a number for US and Canada you will reach one of those accept all calls and leave your numbers with wait all you can for response time. I filled out two bug reports directly from the program with the same result.One of the selling points of anti-virus program was HOURLY updates. Well, guess what. You are lucky to have a DAILY update without a manual interaction. I thought that something is wrong with my work laptop and installed second program (I was nave and bought two) on a BRAND new installation of Windows XP. Result was ABSOLUTELY identical.If you don't believe me - try to contact ANY of their support (not SALES) channels BEFORE you buy their product. My final view on this product would be:1.	Great idea2.	Maybe great initial implementation (the reviews were great)3.	And UNAVAILABLE SUPPORT. Don't waste your time and money
Before buying, I downloaded and installed a 30-day trial version of KIS 6.0.  First, I uninstalled Windows Live One Care.  After installing KIS 6.0 and rebooting, my Windows XP Home Edition computer just locked up.  Had to go through Safe Mode to remove the program via Windows Explorer, since Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel will not work in Safe Mode.When I reinstalled Windows Live One Care, it offered to remove the remains of KIS 6.0 that I couldn't. Next, Internet Explorer 7 would not work at some sites.  Had to call Microsoft Support and a great technician in India took about an hour to straighten out the damaged files in IE7 at no charge.  Thanks a lot, Kaspersky!Now, my computer is working fine.  I am sorry that I did not have a chance to use KIS 6.0, but I will stick with One Care and renew it when my 1st year of free updates expires soon
Based on lots of great reviews, I decided to buy Kaspersky.  After two months, I got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted.  I sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours.  Finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key.  This did not work.  I had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply. This time, no one ever replied.  I sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still, weeks later, have not replied.  I emphatically advise against buying this product.  If you ever have a problem, you will not get help
At first I thought the idea of offering a set of the most popular applications at an affordable price was great. Recently, however, many computer makers have started using MS Works as the standard pre-loaded suite on new machines.Users who need more than very very basic features will need to buy more dependable software packages(e.g. MS Office). The word processor in Works, for instance, does not have many macrons that are commonly used in Dutch, Scandinavian, Turkish, romanized Russian, Japanese etc.. In the end the low price of MS Works is a way to save money to computer makers and to squeeze out extra money from buyers who will need to upgrade to better products anyway
I had to upgrade to MS Works 7.0 due to Y2K issues. I am not nearly as satisfied with MS Wortks 7.0 as I was with MS Works 4.5. I am now searching for a replacement
I started writing code for the web back when you could still order it as a text only service.  DOS ruled the day, and there were no ads plastered on every site.  This is the first product that takes HUGE STEPS BACKWARD in useability, functionality, and performance since the public birth of the web.  Unlike the previous reviewers glowing account of AS 4000 I am looking at new software because the service that this company provides and their complete lack of a proactive nature with regard to its useability have rankled me one too many times.  To wit:1.  I am running a dual core 3.0 with 1 gb of memory and the 3d draw is slower that previous versions.2.  Tech support had the audacity to tell me that going to a drop down menu to rotate an item selected is faster than a right click of the mouse and a context menu that would allow me to do the same from that menu.  This is a step backward of at least 10 years.  Previous versions had the right click menu which also had delete and other frequently used commands available.  Really piss poor on their part to eliminate this feature alone.3.  Despite a fast newer machine, once you select an item you have to wait before you can move it by selecting it a second time.  Pitiful.4.  Won't import standard dxf files without saving them as one layer.  Making a product that won't play nice with others is a bad thing.I have other issues, but just don't want to spend any more time on this company or their products.  If I ran my business and failed to listen to my customers like punch, I would be out of business.Bottom line:  NO LONGER RECOMMENDE
Unfortunately, I had to return the product because it was defective.  The first disk failed to load to my computer.  I contacted Punch Technical staff and they were unable to help me with the problem.  I tried on another computer in the house,and the same thing happened.  I therefore returned the product
The graphics are clear, but they are bad! Horses look nothing like that and it is really gross! I would say get it for the younger kids, because they won't care.There is nothing to do with the game except earn money, build your hotel, and keep your horse from getting sick. You don't get to ride that often because it said "you have ridden enough for this round" and it is very enoying. you can't pay enough monay to keep more than one horse, but you need to jump them to earn money so you can build your hotel / parking lot / jumping corse / breeding paddock / ect. But you can't do that unless you can jump the horse alot, and you can't. It is easy to go 'bankrupt' so I would say this game is not for little kids because of the money dealing.not for older kids because of the dumbness of the horses look, not for younger kids because of the money problems.So don't get this game
My daughter and another second-grade friend both got bored of this game after 20 minutes of staring at a horse standing in a stall and listening to a cat meow.  The controls are not very logical, and there is no animation to speak of
If you have an older systemworks loaded, NSW will go to remove the older GO BACK version.  If it does, (depending on your system) OK.  However, if it wants you to go to Symantek web site and download a GO BACK removal toll, beware.  I downloaded it and ran it and it stated it wanted to restart my system.  What it did was screw up the partition and crashed the system.  GO Back puts your data in a seperate partition.  Symantek knows about this and has a "fix" you run before loading NSW, but they didn't let anyone know that it may crash your system.  On an older PC, without windows restore tool, it works OK.  However, if you have a newer PC with a windows resotre loaded and then have an older NSW GO back loaded, it will crash your PC if you use their GO Back removal tool.  Emailed Symantec twice, they stated they would get back in 7 days - never did.  Hope you have better luc
The new Systemworks has a horrible interface.  You can't see what your options are easily.  You can't see the status of your components.  You can't see what version you have.  When you load it after loading Norton Personal Firewall 2006, the Firewall will not load program rules (you have to uninstall the Firewall and then reinstall it).  I'm not sure how the protection works, but the software "redesign" was done by an ergonomic moron
I have used System Works on my computer since 2000. The 2007 version is nowhere as good as the older ones. They have deleted many of the "real" diagnostic features (Registry Optomizer), dummed down the rest, and added (rather forced) an auto-load Norton Protection Center that takes over the Windows Security Center and cannot be easily unloaded. Software should be made to be user-friendly ... this version is nothing like the previous ones
The software installation is buggy.  It try's to download the entire installation from the SnapStream web site, even though there is a installation disk included.  If your web connection fails the installation trashes your system and you will need to reinstall Windows.  I have Windows XP SP2 with a flakey internet connection. Although I am computer literate, after two attempts to install this product I have chucked the whole thing out the window. P.S. SnapStream has no tech service department to speak of
After 25 years of building PC, and installing software, beta testing software, I am unable, even with Adobe's technical support staff to install Acrobat Version 8.  Software gets to the end of the install process and stalls.  No combination of repair, uninstall, reinstall, registry cleaning, advice from THREE technical support staff after hours on the telephone can solve the problem.  Using XP, with all the latest upgrades, defragging the drives, with 2 MB RAM, and a Adobe Tech support clean registry still fails to properly install the software. 
The "bad serial number" routine as the first reviewer. I'll try Adobe Customer Service when I stop fuming
I use Adobe Acrobat Professional extensively both as an attorney and as a researcher/author.  Because of the new features advertised which would enhance Acrobat storage of PowerPoint presentations, I bought it off the shelves at a local Staples office supply dealer.  I am proficient at my own installations and expected no trouble on this.  It acted like a virus.  The program did not finish installing.  Worse yet, it corrupted the underlying 7.0 installation and fixed that so the Windows Controller program could not install it. I had to hack through the registry to remove traces of it.  Finally I got to a stage where it appeared to be going through the registry process again.  Then I received the coup de grace -- a BAD SERIAL NUMBER MESSAGE.  I checked carefully and it matched the serial number exactly as on the label sent by Adobe inside its factory package.  I used MicroSoft OneNote to make a colored screen copy of this phenonema and marched the package back to Staples where they refunded my money.  It's too bad about the 20 plus billable hours as a lawyer lost to this process.  My experiences in calling Adobe in the past when I puzzled through a far lesser discourage me from wanting to talk to their technical support people (who too often know less than me given the increasingly apparent out-sourcing to people who read from a script and give us credit for knowing far less than we do).  At any rate, I am now bitter.  My 7.08 installation of Adobe worked great on my favorite computer where I had the bulk of my multimedia presentations which I hoped to reduce complete with sounds to the Adobe 8.0 format.  I suspect that wrong serial numbers were slapped on the packages.  I am deeply disappointed, even ANGRY at the inconvenience this has caused me.  I took it home and tried it on my desktop there and it also would not complete the installation and ruined my chances of a clean uninstallation of 7.0.  Deactivation of 7.0 could not take place either after installation of 8.0.  I don't know what Adobe was thinking -- or if they were thinking.  I have been a loyal customer of theirs for many years, but I'm thinking distinctly non-charitable thoughts about them this early morning.  I hope they get their act together -- soon.  They owe us all a quick fix and patch and they need DEEP REPENTANCE for the damage this did to Windows XP home installations which also appear to be corrupted in the process of installing this "upgrade" program which acts more like a computer worm or virus than a program
I have been unable to get the software to work on my Dell computer with WINDOWS XP.  Although I have been in contact with the technical team at SBT on many occasions, my initial problem has never been resolved.  I am unable to use the Test  Improve Your Memory software
Sorry.  I liked the idea, but this product did not meet my expectations.  It did not engage the users.  The interface was 20th century. The technologies used were outdated. My advice is to look elsewhere.
I cannot believe that Taxcut can no longer import capital gains info from Fidelity, which is has been able to do for several years.  I was a happy customer, now I'm a MAD customer.
After spending over an hour waiting on their help line and trying all of their non-functioning suggestions, I was still unable to install this on either of my PCs. They don't want to admit it, but their ad for Deduction Pro kills the software install at 21% (or 26% for the standard version). And no, their "font patch", killing all startup services, upgrading the Flash Player, nor starting in Safe Mode did not resolve the problem. I'm out the money on this and am switching to TurboTax. H Block has lost this customer.
I just input all the information for my return and this software has me owing over $8000.  By my calculations I'm owed a refund of $150-200.  It is not taking federal income tax already paid from annuities into account.  Back to the calculator for me
I just purchased the software and successfully installed it on my computer.  When I got to the point of entering dividends and capital gains, I couldn't figure out how to import the data from Fidelity that I've done for the last few years.  Looking around on the Fidelity website, I can across the following statement: "For the 2005 tax year, Fidelity information will not be able to be imported directly into H Block's TaxCut programs. H Block expects that these products will have this functionality restored for the 2006 tax year."  Unfortunately, this is the reason I'm using a software tax prep program, looks like it's back to TurboTax
I have had to set up a few new installs of the Vista Business on some servers and I was disappointed with the overall performance. My biggest gripe is when I tried to remotely log in from another PC and I sat there waiting and waiting only to discover that the Vista default setup is to ask permission to run even the most basic operations and was actually sitting there waiting for someone to click 'YES' to allow the process to run. How irritating! Kinda self defeats the idea of remotely logging in doesn't it?. Also if you happen to rename the administrator account the change is not registered somewhere in the Remote Connections authorization. So when I *thought* I was remotely logging in under the new admin account name Vista wouldn't let me in and it was only after searching for what seemed an eternity - some hidden place it took me 15 minutes to find, I discovered that the the new admin account name had not been authorized when I did the name change. yikes!For those who need to run VNC Server on Vista, be aware there are issues -  installing and running that you will need to work around as well. It seems like Microsft drastically changed the menus, overdid the default security features, and installed a new hood ornament. Other than that I don't see what the big deal is.
I was required to purchase this with my new computer. I thought I'd give it a chance at work. We have a dedicated wired network, which just requires that you register the machine's MAC address with our DHCP server. Nice and simple, and very much like the LAN in any home where the user has a NAT router.I plugged in the network and tried to get the MAC address. Vista would only give me the wizard to connect my network. OK, I tried the wizard. It offers to let me setup PPPoE with a username and password. That's it, no other options. I asked for other options, and it only offered that I use a modem (that I did not have in my computer.) No options for a dedicated network at all, that I could find.I went to another machine (on the 'net) and searched Google. None of the Microsoft sites were helpful in any way. Lots of PR posturing, but no useful information or troubleshooting.I gave up, found the license and install disks for Windows XP, and downgraded the new machine. It was far, far easier.
You can get Mac OS X for 129 bucks and it has everything as opposed to the Microsoft's 227 dollar Home Premium which is the low end. Buy Mac and get all the functionality in one OS. When spec'ed out the system are comparable in price, except apple doesn't offer low-end hardware options which is why they seem more expensive
The upgrade is $75 cheaper and you DON'T need to have a previous install of Windows to get it to work. Simply do the following:1. Boot with the Windows Vista Upgrade DVD.2. Click "Install Now."3. Do not enter a Product Key When prompted. 4. When prompted, select the Vista product edition that you do have.6. Install Vista normally.7. Once the install is complete, restart the DVD-based Setup from within Windows Vista. Perform an in-place upgrade. 8. Enter your Product Key when prompted. This is according to Microsoft's internal documentation, and reported by Paul Thurrott at Windows IT Pro
I was a private beta tester for the new OS. I tested the software for a whole year and I am not pleased with it.If you depend on stability for your existing software, you are out of luck. The hardware and software support for the new operating system is horrible. Many businesses will have to upgrade their hardware to use Windows Vista. You are better off upgrading to a Mac. After all, Microsoft did steal many ideas from Apple Computers.
I hate this product. Since I'm used to Office 2003 (at work), opening this program and having to look at the childish-looking menu bar was a shock. The layout is irritating, poorly designed, and does not provide sufficient features. To make things worse, this sorry program does not allow you to save files directly to CD. The one-star rating was too generous.
You don't need to be a student or to own your home to get the Home and Student version. Any one can get that version. Microsoft doesn't enforce the student part and by home, they mean where you live
My best rating for Microsoft Money Deluxe is it is pure JUNK. Don't was your money. If it works at all, trust ,it is not with Microsoft Vista. A class action law suit sounds in order for this GARBAGE
I have been a Microsoft Money user for many, many years. (Going back to Money '98? I forget.) I reluctantly upgraded to Money 2007 Premium earlier this year from Money 2004 when I read somewhere that Money 2004 was no longer going to be supported. (I also read that Money 2005, Money 2006, and Money 2007 had issues. Hence my reluctance to upgrade.)For years, I have sync'ed Money with my online accounts on nearly a daily basis. I'm that kind of focused on keeping my eye on my money, and Money has historically served me very well in this habit. Money 2007 does not.Since installing it, I have: 1) Battled with my prior bank for nearly two months to get them to figure out by Money 2007 does not synchronize with their systems. 2) Installed and reinstalled Money 2007 on several different workstations to test the synchronization issue with my years-old Money file and new, empty Money files. Always fails.3) Now I have *switched banks* thinking the syncing issue was my bank's fault. It wasn't. It's Microsoft Money's fault.Syncing fails *every* time with a helpful OBRES 22063 error. Oh, yea, that one! We all know just what that is.I have read every Microsoft knowledge base article I can find. I have perused public.microsoft.money and other usenet groups. I have Googled. I have read blogs. The only thing I find is that lots of people have this problem with lots of different financial institutions, and Microsoft is doing nothing about itIn Money 2004, this worked flawlessly nearly every time. Why did it break?!?!!So if you're looking to have Money synchronize with your accounts online, look elsewhere. But if you're all about putting everything in manually, this product will serve you just fine.Buy a copy of Quicken instead!
I have been using this program for five years now and I'm finally going to switch to Quicken. The 'Invoice Designer' is a total waste of time... it just hasn't worked for years and Microsoft will do NOTHING to get it to work. This is the unwanted step child of Microsoft, so please don't waist your time
I bought this program because I wanted to use it on the pocket pc (DELL Axim X50v).  The program is very confusing to use.  It took some time to load on the PPC first, then you have to load the maps.  I tried to load the map of the whole state and it wasn't working. The map would come up and the gps reciever would pick up where I was, but when I would write an address of a street that exists, it would say "SEARCH DONE, NO MATCH FOUND."  I called the Delorme support many times, they helped me go through the application, but I feel that this application wont give me directions that I want off of the PPC.  I should have bought the iguidance.  One of my friends has this application and it is awesome.  He loaded 3 states all at once and it gives you directions very easily.  There are many points of interest.I particularly like the screen that shows you all the streets in a 3D fashion.  It is easy to use."DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE THAT I MADE, BUY THE IGUIDANCE OR TOMTOM SOFTWARE."  
Terrible product, confusing, not easy to use like McAfee. Not meant for a basic computer user
Buyer beware. If you encounter a technical issue with this product and require a refund, you're out of luck. They will send you in endless circles attempting to get a product refund. There are many other good products out there that do the same thing. It's really easy to purchase, but impossible to get a refund
Unit gives inconsistant results especially with front projection sets.  Spyder also requires room to be as dark as possible in order to make adjustments.  This is not always practical.  The tripod mount fits too loose on Spyder and easily falls off.  I think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product, but not yet ready for prime time
I am really thinking of returning it to Amazon. I think I will stick with good-'ol MS Word. You see I wanted a 12-page form and spent two days creating it. It's a form to survey boats so it also had graphic areas for photos (about 12). Well, all seemed fine until you printed a filled form to .pdf. The size of the created .pdf was near 10MB! (Similary done with MS word resulted in a 1.2MB finished .pdf). Well, I can't be e-mailing 10MB files!I also recieved the book for the 5.0 filler which says it can use Dragon Naturally Speaking (I use that). I'll be darned if I can figure out where that tool is, "you must activate voice recognition in the tool bar." And, if you use Dragon Naturally Speaking in the form filler area all sentences start out without capital letters, say and select does not work. (I should note that Dragon Naturally Speaking works flawlessly in MS Word!) So, you manually have to go back and capitalize each sentence. Finally, as others have said, there is no FAQ and generally no troubleshooting help on the ScanSoft web site.  This is very poor for a near $100 product. There would be no way that I would spend $700 on their premium edition.
Do not buy anything from this company unless you will be able to return it within 20-30 days of the shipping date.  (The receipt says 20 days but the web site says 30 days.) You don't have much time to return an item, and the company does not give any leeway for Christmas orders.  I am stuck with the item my son did not want for his dorm room, and I can't exchange it for another item because he didn't like any of their products. 
I purchased a package for window xp in may this year and just got a computer on which I wanted to use it. On Thursday Nov. 25, we wanted install it but the boot disk # 4 was observed to be problematic and thus the whole installation was not successful.Please advice me.Thanks Rev, Ndorle
I bought this product on the strength of the Norton name, and a positive review in Business Week.    I uninstalled ZoneLabs, Ad-Aware, and all Norton anti-virus.  There were still NAV files after the uninstall.  I had to download their Norton Software Removal tool, which also could not remove some NAV files.   Everytime I re-boot, those problematic NAV files want to re-launch NAV.  The NIS 2007 install was still difficult after all of that effort, and once installed NIS 2007 either freezes up my computer, or makes my internet connection so slow that it is un-usable.So, now I've uninstalled NIS 2007, still have issues with the corrupt NAV files, and will being go back to ZoneLabs and Ad-Aware.
I have always used Norton products, and upgraded to IS 2007 when mysubscription came up for renewal. WHAT A MISTAKE. My computerfreezes up all the time, and the software is difficult to use- it isnot at all straightforward like previous versions of Internet Security.Do not buy this product.
I bought this product because I thought Norton was a quality product. Man did I make a mistake buying this product. I only had it on my computer for 1 month and it made my computer crawl , almost to where it would not  hardly work. I deleted it . Then my computer starting working just fine. This happened to me 2 times before I got tired of it and trashed it.
I bought a new Desktop PC installed with Vista.  It came preinstalled with McAfee 2007.  I have been using Norton products for years, so I bought a 3 user package of North Internet Security 2007.  For the 60 days of the trial, my computer ran flawlessly.  But it was time to install Norton as McAfee had run its course.  I installed the program last night, which took 45 minutes with the Vista update from Symantec, required updates, restarts and the full system scan.  After this time my computer, which as I said ran flawlessly for 60 days, well now every 60 minutes I get the blue screen of death and a forced restart.  I contacted Symantec's customer support only to be greeted with an hour and forty five minutes wait to chat with an analysts (seems that I was not the only one with Norton troubles).   After all this time, the advice I was given was....uninstall and reinstall!!!!  Gee, Einstein, I would have never done that already before I wasted my time contacting you.  But the Symantec analyst was firm that this was the problem.  So I took my morning and uninstalled and reinstalled and...THE SAME BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH but now in under an hour of use!!!  I'm uninstalling this virus and buying a McAfee package ASAP.  Oh also, during the time my computer was not crashing, it ran SLOW!!  It is a 2.8 gig processor with 2 gigs of ram but it ran as if it were a 386 processor with 32 megs of ram.  And everything you run, Norton needs you to approve its connection...EVERYTHING.  You can allow Norton to decide what can and cannot connect so you do not have to click every five second, but then you will not be able to user 1/2 of your programs as the geniuses at Norton did not include them in their `safe' list.I regret buying this and only wish I could give it ZERO stars!!!
After years of using Symantec Norton Antivirus and related internet security products, the upgrade to 2007 seemed like a no brainier.  That was until the install started.  If you run into error 9999,171 you may as well give up, it is over.  Following the Symantec directions for resolution of the dreaded 9999,171 error caused the entire windows XP install to be corrupt and necessitated reinstallation.  Believing that a reinstall was not all bad as it would clean up several old and no longer used software pieces and provide a clean base for installing Symantec I marched forward.  Once XP was installed and current with the patches it was time to install Symantec again.  No luck, I was still receiving the 9999,171 error.Now it was time to get someone on the phone for support.  This is a good trick since Symantec does not readily publish a phone number for support.  The number by the way is 877-832-2810.  Be prepared for a long wait on hold.  During four support calls I experienced no less that 40 minutes on hold and the longest was over one hour.  Support is provided by offshore resources in India so not only are you fighting a technical problem you must also overcome the language barrier.The four separate calls to support resulted in multiple steps to clean up old installs, prep for install, reboot, reinstall, hack through the registry, and oh yah corrupt windows XP again needing a second reinstall.  During the final call, the support rep finally gave up and indicated the Symantec could not be installed on this Windows XP machine.I have since moved on to McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007.  The install took about ten minutes and I am now up and running again.
Norton is now owned by the huge behemouth Digital River, who haven't a clue how to run support or customer service.  They are useless and anything with their grimy mits on it and we take a wide berth of it, wouldn't consider it.  Norton used to be top notch, now it is like pouring mollasses into your computer.  It interferes with everything.  Microsoft seems to have given up on them too, as Norton has not bothered to interface properly with Windows, a consequence being that it is also buggy and problematic.  I can only warn you ~ AVOID!!!  A bad bit of software and a company that hasn't any clue about what customer service is and doesn't look likely to change.  Profit seems to be likely more important to them than service or keeping the Norton family of software up to date and working well... 
This is my first public review of any product. I generally dont have the time or motivation to go throught the process of posting a review. However, I have never had such a negative experience with a commercially available software package before. From beginning to end, the process of repeated attempts to install and then trying to remove NIS2007 was time-consuming, frustrating, and crippled my computer. First the operating environment details. I'm running XP-Pro SP2 on a 2.6ghz pentium with 1GB of RAM. Upon the de-installation of the existing NIS 2006 and Spyware Doctor applications, I proceeded with the installation of NIS 2007. The installation appeared to go cleanly, but upon attempting to restart, my computer hung on shutting down, and upon attempting to come up, I got a blank desktop with no task bar, start menu, or desktop icons. Later, as I was working with Symantec support and was able to get a desktop back, I also experienced things as not being able to bring up the control panel or click on the 'My Computer' icon. Of course, I had no internet access during the whole ordeal. Since I couldnt find any phone number contact in the ridiculously minimal instruction manual that came with the package, I called my local ISP to find out what they knew about the affects of using NIS 2007. Through them I got a phone number for Symantec support. As a side note, the manual points out ways to get support if you have access to the internet and email, but gives no direction if you dont have access to those. Over the course of the next 4 days of working through my issues with NIS 2007, my experience with Symantec support left me with the impression that they were mostly incompetent and quite innefective. I give Symantec credit for having 24/7 phone support, and I did work with one knowledgable support person there named Jay, but most of the experience was frustrating and time-consuming. The help desk is located in India, and the first problem is that they couldnt hear me though I was speaking loudly. The next problem is that I had to answer the same questions repeatedly as if the person didnt understand my answers. On a number of ocassions, I felt the person on the other end was just going through a script, and wasnt listening to what I was saying or reading my growing case notes. I got passed around a lot to different people and spent a lot of time on hold. They kept trying to get me off the phone even though we hadnt worked through the problem completely. In one instance, the helpdesk person was trying to tell me that things were all fixed even when I had told her there was an activation error during the re-install we were working on. Having worked with tech support and edited registries, and tinkered with start-up configurations and various services settings, I could never get NIS 2007 to install (tried four times). Trying to un-install the package turned out to be almost as difficult and troublesome. Uninstalling has left me with problems with my computer I have yet to work out. I still cant use my scanner because it complains about a symantec DLL issue. I have no idea why that would be. Anyway, I would rate this product less than zero if I could. There was nothing that went right, and a lot that went wrong. I cant believe Symantec could put out such a pathetic piece of software with such inffective support. I'm returning NIS 2007 and trying my luck with Zone Alarm. 
This product is horrifying. It worked for three months, at which point it experienced a complete meltdown. Started getting Auto-Protect errors, and suddenly could access the internet with Explorer, but not Firefox. It kept trying to send me to Live Update, which wouldn't work, so I uninstalled and reinstalled Norton. Now the error happened again, and I could access the internet with Firefox, but not Explorer. An error message referred me to an online "fix," but -- guess what! -- you can't access any of their fixes with Firefox. You MUST be using Explorer. (Which is, in and of itself, offensive and obnoxious.) Explorer, of course, wasn't working. (Incidentally, with Norton uninstalled, all worked fine, so that was indeed the source of the problem.) Uninstalled and reinstalled Norton again, hoping to get on Explorer and get the fix before the error recurred, but now I couldn't get on the internet AT ALL. At that point, I uninstalled Norton for good. Ditto on the fact that they don't support the product, apparently don't stand behind the product, and apparently aren't very concerned about their reputation. Very disappointing. Previous versions were just fine; this is a complete mess
Just terrible software.  Often does not work - if that would be the only thing it would be enough.  But it is worse than that.  Bogs down your computer big time.  Makes it run super slow.  Horrible.  Whoever has written good reviews must be shills for Norton.  Avoid.  Repeat.  Avoid
Bought System mechanic 6 pro online, it repairs but reports problems but you cannot get information at all. None of the modules report what is being done. If you need assistance forget it, all you get from IOLO is go see the FAQ's, I don't think humans work there just a computer that generates emails. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!
After installing in Sony vgc-ra810 system crashed. Unable to find C:. Have been waiting two days for a legitimate answer from I0L0 and now have two case ##. Phone attempts are met with automated replys the same as the internet. The Amazon seller has been very helpfull so I can not blame him. If I ever get my computer running I plan on visiting all sites that support reviews with a word of advice about lack of HUMAN product support by IOLO. As for now I wanted to get this out to Amazon customers so I am using my neighbors computer
Save your money!!!I used the evaluation version of System Mechanic version 6 for 29 days and thought it was great enough that I paid for and upgraded to System Mechanic Professional version on the subscription option for $69.95.I download the installer and ran it at 7:30 am on Sunday morning.  None of the modules, I repeat NONE worked.  I uninstalled.  Cleaned out my registery and directories of all traces of this and the previous version and reinstalled, several time to the point that I gave up at 8pm the sam night.  I search the online support and found no help.  I wrote an email and as of today (Wednesday) have not yet received a reply.  Their phone is constantly busy but I did get through last night at 7pm eastern time (they close at 8pm eastern/5pm pacific) and was transferred to tech support.  For the next hour I listened to the message: "All of our support specialist are busy.  Please stay on the line and your call will be answered in the order in which it was received" until 8pm when the recording switched over to: "Thank you for calling Iolo.  Our business hours are from 9am to 5pm pacific time.  Please call back during these hours."I'm extremely upset.  I'm not a noob and have been using computers since the 386 days.As soon as my American Express bill cycles, I will call and have the charge removed.Version 6 was great, version 7 tanks.Save your money.  Spend it with a company who responds to their customers
Systemic Mechanic 6 seemed to be helping, since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well. However, the "repair broken shortcuts" function does not work properly.  For a variety of reasons I use a large number of Microsoft Word Shortcuts in my Folder/ File  system.   System Mechanic "repaired broken shortcuts" on a large number of my short-cutted documents by directing the shortcut from the correct file target to the wrong file target.   Now I am pulling up documents which are similar ( but are actually older versions which I have save to an auxiliary hard drive ) or unrelated to the actual, correct target file. This has had severe productivity consequences,  since I have to double check the target of every file opened via a shortcut.Contacting on-line Help was of no help whatsoever.  
Why buy Iolo System Mechanic when you can get malware for free?I installed Pro 7 and it gave many, many problems. Iolo did not respond to my emails so I uninstalled. Their uninstaller did not work either
My daughter (13) and I tried The Number Devil together. She has ADD and has difficulty with math. We found the intro to be too long and the games boring.  This game did not keep her attention at all.  We also tried Math Blaster and would recommend that game instead. I am glad others have found this game helpful unfortunately it didnt for us.
I bought this software two days ago, Installed it on my laptop and all of a sudden, my network connection was messed up. I could not figure how to connect to the wireless or wired network. My other computers were still able to connect, so it was a problem with the computer with Fix It installed. After much work, I finally uninstalled the software and right away was able to get back on the network. I am not sure if there is some kind of firewall setting with the software, or if it was just the software itself.Anyway, I am unsure whether to reinstall this software or not
This software might be recommended if better utilities weren't out there. This one gives the user a sense of security, but when my system crashed, Fix-It couldn't. I dutifully put in the Rescue Disk, booted up on it, restored my earlier system, exited and rebooted.Nothing. Before I'd been able to get into safe mode, but now nothing. So when I manually restored my system, guess which program got yanked? And it freed up a lot of system resources, too. (Had I known how much before, that alone would have soured me.) My system now runs faster and doesn't lag while typing.Another small criticism: Even though Fix-It has automatic update for virus scans, I found more often than not I had to go to the VCom site and manually download the anti-virus files. No reason was ever given; I'd just get a message telling me to do it. Very inconvenient.Also WARNING*WARNING: This program has strict activation. You can only have it on one computer, so forget putting it on your notebook computer. Finally, be careful when cleaning your registry. Look at every entry this suite wants to delete. If you run it on default, it may remove critical registry keys and settings. In fact, I'd use a different registry cleaner or some of the free ones. Fix-It has some great features, but not enough to make it worth the system resources and a system sluggish system. (Not to mention the anti-virus problem). Try System Mechanic instead. 
I installed this software after getting it free after rebates, and I must say I am not the least bit impressed. It claims to speed up your system, but instead only slows it down. Seems like it would be because it was bugging down my computer, but it's relatively new and has a gig of memory. As another reviewer mentioned, my internet stopped working correctly (although the other computers on my network without this program worked just fine with internet!) and my system restore just wouldn't work. It deleted a lot of entries I needed to run my system correctly.The anti-spyware was an absolute joke  the updates were large files almost every day. 8 MB a day practically.On a lighter note, Fix-It Utilities found a virus other programs were unable to find.I use Zone Alarm Security Suite and then use CCleaner to take care of the rest. I think they're the best combination. No program beats Zone Alarm's. Fast, secure, and won't bug down your computer. I had to reinstall my operating system thanks to Fix-It Utilities
I installed the product hoping it would help me with all the errors I was getting (I have Windows XP). Well, 2 weeks and $200 it's what it took for me to have my computer repaired. It would not let me log on to windows, I got errors I've never seen and it completely messed all my files. BIG waste of money. I had to re-format my hard drive and my computer is only 1 month old!!
Purchased Fix-It Utilities 6 a few weeks back and installed it on my desk top running Windows XP.  Immediately after installation I ran the program and repaired only the minimum errors as recommended.  However, many programs on my computer would not run and could not access many files.  Called VCOM for help ,but  their solution did not work.  I was even unable to get system restore to correct the problem. I had to re-format my hard drive and re-install all my programs and files.  I cannot recommend this registry repair
Don't buy this software even if you get it free after rebates.  It corrupts your windows registry and makes things worse for you.  You will feel your computer is far better after uninstalling this software.Instead, just follow these steps to keep your PC fast:1.  Run Disk Cleanup (provided by XP)2.  Defrag your hard-disk regularly3.  Clean the registry (there are lot of free software available to clean your registry).  That's all that you need to keep your computer fit.  No need to use softwares such as Fix-I
I recently purchased an HP Laptop that, to my regret, came with a pre-load of Win Vista.  Some of the bad things about this package are:1. The help files are all on line.  If I'm not connected to the internet, I can't access the help files.2. HP does ship it's laptops with the Vista install CD's.  Instead, a CD to purchase an upgrade to the next version of Vista is included.3. For the newer laptops, HP is not producing drivers for any other OS except Vista.4. Vista is less user friendly than XP or even 2000.5. And yes, Vista looks familiarly like OS X, but is harder to work with.  I have owned several Apples and looks are deceiving.  Just because it looks like an Apple doesn't mean it works like one.6. All of my instructional software no longer works.  I use a lot of software to teach Information Security that no longer works on Vista, such as:  a. CyberCiege (An information security wargame)  b. Boson CCNA Network Simulator  c. Visual Studio (Not everything works)7. Also, some of the network management tools will not run or run properly on Vista.  I do a lot of remote management from the workstation versus going to the server.  Many of the vendors that provide tools are way behind the power curve on their Vista support.I could go on but what's the point?  I can't even dump Vista to go back to Windows XP or even 2000 if HP won't even make an attempt to produce drivers for the laptop.  Linux is out for the same reason, no drivers.  So I'm basically stuck with an overpriced emailer and word processor.If you plan on purchasing a computer, make sure that if you plan on dumping the OS and going back to XP or changing to LINUX, the vendor has all of the drivers to support the change is not on the Microsoft Vista Conspiracy bandwagon
Come one people, Windows Vista is not only as unstable as it's Windows predecesors with a very uglu memory management and a really unsecure and ineffective hard drive and files management; I've lost lots of very important files due to Windows "errors" that shut down applications and even the PC itself, so i decided my self: TO USE LINUX OR TO DIE WITH MICROSOFT !, and i'm still alive ! ;-)As i told you, Vista is nothing more but a cheap copy of visual effects that Linux users had from several years from now; in facto, right now i'm using a Linux version called Sabayon and it is a million light years away from Windows Vista, it's visual effects are simply incredible (try searching "Beryl" in youtube for you to know what i'm talking aboyt), i have not only 3D windows, but 3D Desktops, incredible effects to minimize and maximize and a veeeery looooong list of features that you have to see it for yourself to beleave it.I know that you might be concerned for several aspects at this points that wooried me in time (when i was evaluating Windows Vs Linux):1.- My Documents, that will happen with them?. Nothing will happen, in fact you'll ba able to open them and modify them as you please, the OppenOffice suite is totally compatibble with your Microsoft Documents.2.- My programs?, well there are several options to run Windows programs in Linux, as "cedega", "wine", etc etc etc, si it means that you will be able to run most of the windows programs in Linux.3.- Is it hard to use ?. No way !, it's as easy to use as Windows, you will only have to dedicate a few time (may be a couple of hours) to understand several conceps as the multiple destops, the file system, and the users and permission management (that is the one of the most secures in the world) (Microsoft Windows cant's say that!).So, if you don't beleave search google for sabayon and youtube for beryl and you will open your eyes!.So... think about spending this 400 bucks twice, because Sabayon and other versions as Ubuntu, Kubuntu, some versions of SUSE, and other Linux distributions are TOTALY FREE of charge!. you only have to download them and burn it to a CD or DVD, whatever you like.
I bought Vista to get the inevitable familiarity over with as early as possible and what I discovered was an operating system not even close to being compatible yet. Half if not 80% of all routers are not Vista-ready yet, so you can't get a network running for at least a few more months. Any accesories you own with your system no longer work unless they're compatible.. (ie, printers, scanners, burners, etc) so you not only buy an operating system, you have to buy an entirely new set of hardware to go with it. Majority of my programs did not work with Vista, be it Adobe software, Maya, Poser and God forbid any games you own like Warcraft. For the expense and complete hassel, it's not worth owning until eveything is "Ready" (which will probably be a year from now) Save your money. - I returned my copy
This OS is not for any ordinary user.  If you know nothing about drivers, peripherals, etc, then don't get this OS.  Lots of incompatability issues.  I thought this OS would make my gaming experience better, apparently it needs lots of work.  Can't play CS:S, Day of Defeat, Lord of the rings Online, etc.  BF2142 and some other games play slower in Vista compared to XP.  I hardly write reviews, but I just want everyone to know that this OS suxs!  Stay with XP Pro SP2.  Games move faster and load better and encoding video and editing software runs much much better on XP.  It isn't worth getting right now, wait a year or two until it gets worked out.  Feels like BETA, which it shouldn't.  Microsoft, you get a F- for your new OS.  You fail.  Nice try
I'm not a tech guy.  But from a simple user's standpoint, there is no reason whatsoever to change unless you just have to have a small change in appearance.  About 1/2 the software you might have purchased that worked with XP won't work with Vista.  I was thinking that Vista would be an improvement.  But there is nothing there.  Just some minor superficial changes as far as I can tell.  Maybe for IT people, there might be some big difference, but for your average user, there is no improvement at all.Save your money.  Don't buy it. 
You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have.15 years of Outlook and you can't print a single address label or an envelope with one click. (or 10 clicks for that matter)There is no function to easily print out mailing labels either. Lets remember Outlook is a Contact manager ... next to many other things... Maybe Outlook 2010 will be the answer.
For those considering Outlook 2007, beware of my experience: one morning I ran Outlook 2007 to find it would not download email messages at all. (I would get an error about MAPI.) This appears to be due to an automatic office update of the junk mail filter.One of the most important features of an email program is that it doesn't suddenly stop being able to check email (imagine being on a business trip). Automatic improvements to the junk mail filter sounds great, but if that means one morning I wake up to not be able to check email at all, then the medicine is worse than the disease.The new features and changes Outlook 2007 really do not compensate for the lack of reliability. If you have another email program that works, I'd stick with it and not switch to Outlook 2007.On a positive note, I was able to fix the above problem by running repair (reinstall) from the Office 2007 install program, but this took half an hour or so to run.
I have 7 and 9 year old boys that play chess.  They are also both very computer savy.  I bought this program to buff up their chess playing skills and stategy, but they say they find it boring and don't think it has anything to do with playing chess because the game pieces and boards look nothing like the traditional game pieces.  The characters are very difficult to identify and confusing, they are cartoon renditions dressed up in costumes.  I'd save your money and look for a better chess program or get your child involved in an actual chess club
Im going to rate this product a 2 because I like it but I would change a few things if I could.  It does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff.  The couple of things I would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord, you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds, then  you have to stop and click play again.  I wish there was an option where  you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again.  The other thing is something a little more important.  The product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play, its called OLGA.  Well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore.  So you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the Beetles or Metalica or The Grateful Dead or anyone else, and thats what they advertise "Play hit songs". So overall, knowing all this I would have shopped around more.  Especially for the price, its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs. 
I bought this CD title b/c I wanted to learn how to play the guitar again.  My decision to purchase this was based solely on all the Amazon reviews that I perused beforehand.  You can definitely learn to play the guitar with this, but there are so many other titles out there that are cheaper and more up-to-date.  Furthermore, there is nothing more annoying to me than hearing the instructor loudly singing the songs over the guitar strumming.  His voice dominants in many parts of the lessons, and it deafens the sound of the guitar which makes it very difficult to hear the chords being taught.  Again, the software is good but may not be the best on the market.  Then again, I've only purchased three titles, and this one offers a few things that the others don't include
After I installed this software, my Windows XP system shut down with the dreaded "blue screen of death".  I'm still trying to return my system to its former useable state!  Beware
Doesn't work on Mac like it says that it does louses up your machine not worth i
The problem with this game starts with the introductury movie... it develops slowly, goes on forever, suffers from disconnected animation and does little to set up the ridiculous premise for game play. Once game play FINALLY does start, my child found the games boring and the TRANSITIONS between the games tediously slow.  Cute characters...zero edutainment.  It was consigned to the dustbin by the end of the day
I guess I'm spoiled by the I Spy games I've purchased for my children. This game has an enormous amount of "story"...it's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television. Interaction is confusing and frustrating. I'd rate this lower but it's clear that a lot of work went into the animation, which is top notch. I just wouldn't classify this as a learning game.
I have a 2 month old high-end Dell PC with tons of memory and disk, running Windows XP Pro.  This game doesn't work.  Period.  First of all, when I installed it, it reset my graphics options.  Second, when I attempt to play a game, even at the settings that it chose, I get nothing but a white screen.  After numerous tries, and killing the program with the task manager, I finally attempted the other Activities options.  Clicking on them does absolutely nothing!  It doesn't recognize my mouse clicks.I'm assuming that the game was written for the Apple Mac, and ported to the PC.  Trust me, it doesn't work.  BTW, we have tons of other kids games and have never had a problem with any of them.  Now I have to figure out how to return this silly thing. 
This thing is a nightmare. First, it is impossible to understand unless you already know how to run some other comparable system. Next, it requires a huge amount of fiddling with buffers (believe me -- read the help files on this, which are huge and suggest ten different things to do when your music doesn't sound good, and trust me, it won't, either before or after unlimited tweaking). Finally, it actually does not export as it says it does. It lost my files, including one song I cannot quite reproduce (gone forever). Bottom line: If your idea of fun is spending two weeks of vacation fiddling with software that does not work and will never work, then by all means, buy this garbage. I have been using computers since 1985, and this is, I think, the worst single product I've ever seen. On the other hand, if you want to actually make music, you might want to try Sony's ACID Pro 6, which you can try out for free (the company thinks you'll like it, whereas the sadists at Cakewalk must know perfectly well that you won't, hence no demo).
The retail price is totally wrong. I could get it for cheaper from another vendor
Cakewalk"s advertisement saying something like..." no experience needed to operate this software..." is, in my mind, mis-leading at least and a down right lie at most. I've had it now for about three weeks, work on it most days, usually in the middle of the night so I can really concentrate on it, and still cant get anything out of it.All I wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work...blues, pop, country....so far nothing and I am thinking about giving up.I can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk I have ever seen.BEWARE...unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed.    
This is the slowest. Operating. System I have ever used. The first time I installed XP Home, I didn't see what was so bad about it, but when we tried installing it on our new Gateway Machine, it imedettly slowed all system operations down to a crawl. Even My brother's laptop, which is a very Fast Machine, has XP pro, and it randomly slows down. Don't get this operating system. It's slow, buggy, and expensive
This operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory I have ever used--including DOS, Win 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows 98. Aside from being incompatible with older hardware, XP Home Edition crashes frequently-particularly if you like to work with several windows open at once. Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware. True enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway. I had to hire an expensive data recovery guru-another story in itself. Even reinstalling the program did not solve the problem. My computer was completely compromised. I was eventually forced to junk the machine. After my dreadful experience with XP Home Edition, I have sworn off Windows forever. Mac and Linux are both far superior
Do not buy this.  Go with Mac OS X 4.2 Tiger, it doesn't crash or lock up.  Plus you will get access to really cool applications out of the box that lets you do almost anything media-wise.  I could go one for hours how the Macintosh operating system is better but I will say one last thing...  Tiger is faster than Windows.  Research has proved that Tiger and all the other operating systems conserve CPU performance to such an extent that 90%-100% of the speed is left for applications and such.  Windows eats up so much speed along with DOS that from 20%-30% of the performance is left for the user.  That puts a normal Windows computer (3Ghz) at less than 1Ghz.  While a normal Mac computer (2Ghz) runs at 2Ghz.  Plus the fastest Mac is a dual G5 each running at 2.7Ghz.  So actual speed is 5.4Ghz.  The fastest Windows computer is around 3.6Ghz which runs around 1Ghz.  That is a HUGE difference (5.4Ghz-1Ghz.)  When Apple moves to Intel chips next year (about,) The Macs will run around 6.4Ghz if not more.  That is an even MORE HUGE difference.  Take my word for it.  The Windows world is not worth it.  Whenever I go on my Mom's computer (which is running on Windows XP,) I encounter a lock up or annoying hickup in the OS, EVERY TIME!!  I agree that a good amount of people don't find Windows to be unstable, but even when I go to a friend's house I notice them there as well.  Every Windows computer I have used for more than 20 minutes has locked up.  But it's not just this, it's also that Tiger is so much easier to use.Take my advice (I've converted many people) and switch to Mac... Please.  I swear that most of you who read this and switch will be very pleased.  It might be a little wierd at first to get used to the new OS, but I mastered it in a day when it took me months on Windows.  Plus you can purchase Microsoft Word for Mac as well (which I think is easier to use than the Window's counterpart.)So go and throw that ugly Windows computer away and get a spanking new, shiny white, STABLE, Mac!!!
I have used DOS, Win3.1, Win95, Win98 and now this piece of crap OS. Microsoft's only interest is making money, thats why they come out with a new release of an OS upon a new release of an OS. Each one just as buggy, insecure and unstable as the previous version.Anything coming from Microsoft just plain sucks.I have now switched from InterCrap explorer to Mozilla and from Out-Crash-express to Thunderbird, soon I will completely switch to Linux, a FAR better and FUNCTIONAL OS for a far better price, namely free. My next laptop will be a Mac.Dont waste your money, Microsoft designed software is garbage by definition. And for the person saying he can understand we are not all geeks : I shouldnt HAVE to be a frigging geek to use an O
Since buying the upgrade of windows XP i have had to reinstallit 3 times -onto a clean hard disk- The first time it just disappeared and turned into a blue screen,with messages that hive files were gone missing? 2nd time round the registery gotcorrupted and the last time it refused to boot,and not wantingto have to trall through another install i used the XP CD to try the recovery consol. This was as much use as a cigarettelighter on a motor bike. None of the commands worked,and even trying the help file was useless. There seems to be a seriousproblem with system restore in XP, and im fully updated with all the latest SPacks,and stacks of space on my hard disk  alotted to SR! Check dates will disappear and when you really need ST to get you back and running -it goes pear shaped! I now running 3 restored version of XP completly backed up on a seperate hard disk using Power Quests Drive image.My experences with XP are ITS NOT RELIABLE..
I am not at all happy with this product. The instructions are terrible and the program is not at all intuitive. It was a total waste of my money and time.
I was able to install most of MS office but am having printer conpatability problems.   I wasn't able to install Vitural Pc properly and get error messages when i boot up.  I'm going to have to the Mac store genius bar to get the problems straightened out.  All in all I think that every thing will work OK but I'm going to have yto travel over 50 miles to get it fixed.  Maybe it's best to stick with Mac software for Macs.  I've NEVER has a problem installing them
This product arrived with 2 number 2 installation disks for the Virtual PC and no number 1.  As a result, I was not able to install VPC, which was one of the reasons I purchased this overly expensive product.  The Office part does not seem that signicant an upgrade to the Office X that I had. So it is both an aggravation and a rip off
I purchased the upgrade since I'd already bought both Office v.X and Virtual PC 6.1 last year. The biggest letdown is that Microsoft's promised support for the G5 is nearly non-existent.  I have a dual processor G5 with an ATI Radeon 9800 card (Apple), and after trying to install Virtual PC 7 three times, I cannot get a VM to work.  It did install (and work) flawlessly on my G4 Powerbook.  Googling for reviews finds it's very hit or miss, but if (when) it misses, you'll regret investing the extra $$$ in an immature product
This product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs. The tech support emailed that any CD or DVD copy software had to be removed. I guess that sort of makes a DVD or CD R/W drive rather pointless. I removed the copy software and still have bad results. About 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it.  Maybe it doesn't like my corporate virus protection. I find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky. I rate this product as totally useless.
I have had trouble and no satisfaction with this product.I am downloading Grateful Dead concerts from the internet. I want to turn them into audio or data CDs. Sometimes I get a whole concert as one giant file; I want to cut that into tracks and save it. Sometimes I get a bunch of tracks; I want to combine the songs that "go into" one another (my car stereo inserts a two-second delay between tracks). One of the things I want to do is to save the files (which are mostly MP3s) in the same bit rate and format as the originals, so I loose as little "music" as possible.The MP3 codec seems to be really buggy. Most of the combinations of bit rates and codec strategies create really wacky files: some go 5/6 normal speed, others are compressed into chopped up shortened versions of the original. When I pick a combination of settings that work, I usually lose a lot of fidelity as compared to the original (even when I'm only combinining four MP3's into one).Try cutting one MP3 into two, and then recombining the parts into a whole. No matter what I try, there's a little click in the place where the two files are joined. This should be an easy thing, since a lot of very basic editing is cutting and splicing.The upshot is, buying this was $40 down the drain. I'm going to have to find better software for my purposes
The reviews of this software are a bit harsh, but pretty much true. It slow, is a resource hog, doesn't really like to share the machine with other applications. Support is bad, email transfer to move it to another system just plain doesn't work and it is really hard to make a complete backup with all of your attachments.  And - Windows Vista support is really limited.That said, if you have a really fast machine it does work well and has features I use every day that I can't get anywhere else. You can save any email as a history record attached to the sender OR any other person in your contact database. These attachments are copies so they stay with the database even if you purge your email (which is nice). Email client is simple, but because it ISN'T OUTLOOK - I have personally been almost completely unaffected by worms, virus and other email hazards that have over the years affected most MS Outlook users. This is a feature that has saved me more time than the hassles in the first paragraph.The program runs smoothly for me but, I have a Core 2 Duo 7200 with 2 gigabytes of RAM. Just about the fastest processor you can get. I think without the maximum processor and memory you WILL have delays and slooow loading times.One more issue you might have is making backups. Since it uses a SQL database that is open whenever SQL Server is running, a normal backup program might not be able to backup the database file. You need to stop the service first. This is a hassle that if you don't know about you might be setting yourself up for disaster.
Let's start with Outlook interface.  These are the exact words from their user manual:"ACT! 2007 E-mail will work through Microsoft Outlook versions 2000, 2002 (XP) or 2003."So those of us with newer versions of Outlook cannot synch the Outlook email or calendar with Act.  What's the point?  Then what are you supposed to synch with your Blackberry - Outlook so you can get your calendar and email information or Act so you can get your client database.The Act email is so basic and primitive looking, you  can't put attractive auto signatures on it.Then they tell you that you can have one month of telephone support, but it's only available during work days, not on the weekends.  Since I purchased the product on the weekend, I won't be able to speak with someone to ask for a full refund until Monday.  I've used this product for 24 hours and I'm giving up.  What a waste of time and money.How does this company survive with such a bad product?  If anyone knows of a good CRM program for a small business, please share.  
iF i COULD, i WOULD GIVE THIS NEGATIVE STARS.Caveat emptor! Let the buyer beware. I made the horrible and expensive mistake of buying this the beginning of Feb. 2007. I had to open the box to realize I needed to load it as administrator. That was beyond my limited knowledge. Since it was opened I stupidly believed in their money back guarantee and got a return authorization. It took forever and many calls. They kept on lying on when the refund was mailed. Yes, this went into April 2007!!!!! They insisted the mailing date was April 9th. On the 18th I thought I'd never get it. They stopped payment and maybe issued another. Well, I received the $199 (I am shafted on my state sales tax.) But because those idiots didn't put the name of my street, it apprently was returned and what I got was postmarked April 16th!!!!! And they refuse to rescind the stoppayment. Sooooo...I now need to pray I will ever receive the replacement. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I can't beleive these people sell accounting and contact software
Good grief.  Where do I begin?  We upgraded two computers from 6.0 to ACT 2007.  Prior to the install, we totally reformatted our hardrives and did a clean install of Windows XP.  We performed an XP update, installed MS Office and basically had two smokin' clean machines - more or less brand new.  Then we we installed ACT! 2007 expecting perfection. Our problems with the software have been:1) Miserable, buggy installation - barely worked.2) Inability to convert our old ACT 6.0 e-mail database into the new version of ACT 2007.  3) Slow, slow, sloooowwww performance.4) e-mails will delete themselves for no apparant reason.  This is the worst of all.5) Terrible syncing with the Palm.  Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't, overwrites data when it is not supposed to and vice-versa.5) Useless Sage tech support.Don't buy this product.  In fact, I would never buy another product from Sage ever again.  My colleague has already ditched ACT! and switched to using the Palm Desktop and Outlook Express.  This was after losing all his e-mails.  If I lose all my e-mails again - I will uninstall and ditch my copy altogether.I would love to reclaim the hours of my life lost to this poorly written loser of a program.
1 Star is being generous.  I've been an ACT user for almost 20 years.  I think it's time to say good-bye.Reasons:1.  2007 version is agonizingly slow.  Effects my whole system.  I added 1 gb of RAM bringing my total to 2gb with no improvement.  Seems like 5 secs to execute ANY command in the program.  Doesn't seem like much bu count it...one one thousand, two one thousand...  It adds up when you use the program all day, every day.2.  Support is atrocious. You get 60 days after purchase and then can't even access their tech moderated forum unless you pay $300 a year.3.  It ought to be broken down.  I use it to manage client information and communication, I don't need all the Opportunity garbage and one can spend more time managing a process than actually doing the darn thing.4.  Support sticks.  In the last couple of years, I've never had a phone call answered in less than 30 minutes...and that includes when I was dumb enough to pay the then $200 a year.5.  Support stinks even when you pay 300 a year.6.  Support is a ripoff.  One support plan.  No by incident option.  300 bucks or nothing.7.  Did I mention that support is the worst?  They seem to do things on the website and then think about what they just did.  Navigating their forums is a nightmare.  I had to click around for 10 minutes this morning to figure out how to post in an unmoderated forum.  (BTW, 4 messages total in the 2007 section in 6 months.  I guess most pay their 300 bucks for the moderated forum.)8.  An example of how time consuming it can be:  It took me a week of phone calls with several reps to get the UPGRADE installation to function.  And I mean it didn't function at all.  It made such a mess that I had to reformat my hard drive to get it to install.  A first in 20+ years of computer use.Sage seems to think this program is the only one a user installs on their computer.  Bad attitude.SAGE and ACT! are poster children of everything bad about the software industry today.Do yourself a favor, if older versions are working for you...stay there.  The enhancements in 2007 are not worth the trouble.If you're looking for a contact manager, look elsewhere.
It is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company.I have owned this software for about 80 days. 1. In 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice.2. I have called the 'support' line 4 times. The minimum time I was on hold was 40 minutes.3. My initial 'support' period is about to expire and I now will have to pay $200 to get more 'support'4. You have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device.In summary: The product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them.Save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else
I have been a long-time ACT! user. My biggest complaint is recovery. If you have to move the email and database to another computer due to a failure you have to jump through hoops; that's just what one feels like doing when the pressure is on. I still can't bring my ACT! 2007 email over even though ACT! says it was restored successfully (empty folders!). They have a ridiculous technical support team unwilling to help unless you pay, pay and pay and their knowledge base must have been restored like my email: non-existent. The earlier versions were great. I agree with a previous reviewer that when they switched to SQL it all went downhill. I think I'll stick with anything else. It is really ashame. ACT! used to be fast, tight and clean; now it is clunky, lethargic and hangs for 20 seconds on all the time (for some stupid reason) running on an a 2.4 dual core AMD with 4GB memory. Even when Symantec had it they didn't screw it up, but now, you may be better-off sticking with the Palm Pilot contact management software--well, maybe not
I just purchased the top end Dell Dimension XPS (with the 10,000 RPM harddrive) but I still have to allow about 10 seconds for the initial program startup, then it seems to hang for 15 to 20 seconds after that. I usually just go get a cup of coffee when I start ACT and when I come back we are ready to roll.I also reboot my system every time I close ACT.  The system just seems to run better without any "lingering" remnants of the program in memory.Whenever I delete a contact the program locks up.  It has done this through several versions.  I simply reboot, restart ACT and it works fine.At some point ACT changed the date on many (hundreds) of my activities to 11/18/2004.  Now I manually type the date into the call, to do, meeting and note fields to avoid this problem in the future.I have been an ACT customer since the early DOS days.  I have a huge commitment to the program in that much of my important data is now stored here (and some of it is nowhere else).  It is so difficult to export "all the data" (including notes, history, etc) that I am basically trapped.My point is, a program like this is not one that you can easily bail out of like Word or Excel, which has some alternatives available which will read your current files.  A lot of the ACT! database is proprietary and while you can purchase a conversion program from a few vendors, it is not a cheap proposition to do so
We may never know if we like this product as the Amazon box was empty when it arrived.  We have had no help from amazon, compusa, nor the maker of this software after numerous emails and phone calls.  This was my son's Christmas present and he's still waiting... at this rate we'll end up with the opinion that we shouldn't order software online...
DarkBASIC is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games. To make a commercial-quality game in this language would be lunacy, BASIC just isn't quite flexible enough to do that with ease, and the DarkBASIC renderer looks very, very ugly. However, BASIC remains very easy to learn and DarkBASIC has some commands that are fun to toy with.If you're trying to get into serious game development, learn C++ and either learn how to use libraries like OpenGL or DirectX, or start modding a popular engine like the Unreal engine or Source. And make sure you've learned a good deal of physics and math
This program is good if you want to mold the matrix bit by bit. But if you want to make games in a snap, spring for the professional and get a level editor on a DarkBASIC website
I got this as a present about two years ago, and I have had mixed feelings.  I like it, but I get really frustrated because the program is buggy.  I cannot create a standalone executable, and the program has random bugs.  Also, it is very hard to create proffesional-type games.  Be aware that the machine you run standalone programs on has to have a video card, regardless of whether you use it or not.  In conclusion, good idea, but very buggy
Thought the cards would be like Broderbund's American Gretings Creatacard Platinum 8 software but it was not and I did not like what I got.
I bought a new state-of-the-art computer in February that came preloaded with Windows Vista. I was initially excited to get a computer that was running the newest operating system, and I hoped it would mean that my computer would have a much longer effective life. I have been nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine, especially knowing that had I called Dell, they would have installed XP instead.PROs:-Better security (it prompts me  allows me to stop some of the annoying "automatic" programs that software makers sneak onto your system)-Better appearance (this is strictly cosmetic, and I'd rather stare at an ugly screen that worked rather than a pretty, useless one)CONs:-FREEZING: I use this computer 2-3 hours a day and I can expect 1-2 freezes/day. Restarting often fails, and I have to cut the power and restart again.-DISPLAY PROBLEMS: although the cosmetics of the program were better, Vista can't display anything right. I tried updating the display driver which caused a major crash after restarting. I had to boot in safe mode and rollback the driver to get my computer back. Apparently, the newest display drivers are incompatible with Vista.-INCOMPATIBILITY: Entirely too many programs are incompatible with Vista, including some fairly big ones (lots of Adobe software, iPods, display drivers, etc.) I know Vista is new, and these software companies are slow to adapt, but does it really make sense for an operating system like Vista to render virtually all of my other software obsolete? Why can't Vista play nicely with the other kids?-ITS SLOW!!!-- Part of the reason I bought a new, state-of-the-art computer was to replace my old laptop (which still runs OK, but has become a little buggy  sluggish in the past 4 years). Although this computer is light years ahead of the old one, it actually runs EVEN SLOWER than my old laptop. Technical support has largely attributed this to the demands of Vista.BOTTOM LINE:1. IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTERS, AVOID VISTA LIKE THE PLAGUE2. VISTA IS A RIP-OFF. Save your money and keep/get XP-- I'm probably going to return my computer and make the manufacturer install XP so I can regain some speed and system stability. Maybe in the future Vista will work OK, but not right now...3. The incompatibility issues-- though there are several-- conspicuously include problems with Mac-oriented software (iPod, Adobe). I can't help but feel that Microsoft built-in these specific incompatibility issues in order to battle Apple
SAVE YOUR MONEY. DOES'NT BILL ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH OF IT? I WISH BILL HAD TO PAY US FOR ALL THE WASTED TIME AND HEADACHES. DON'T WORRY, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE YOU CAN FIX IT. WHAT A RACKET
 Microsoft should have done more testing on this product.  This is one mess up product.  I have never seen a version of Microsoft Windows so mess up.  There are so many bugs in this product it is not funny.  I've always been a big Microsoft fan, but I can't endorse this version of Microsoft Windows.  I'm a PC and Console gamer and let me tell you something.  Microsoft Windows Vista does not go with most PC games.  That is very sad. Even if Microsoft gave me a free version of Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium, I wouldn't take it.  I've read where some Federal Government Agencies won't even use Microsoft Windows Vista because it so mess up and it has so many bugs in it.  I'll stick with Microsoft Windows XP which from what I understand pretty much does all the same things that Microsoft Windows Vista does but without all the bugs in it. Plus you can play any PC game on Microsoft Windows XP.  You can't do that with Microsoft Windows Vista.  I love Microsoft Windows XP. Why should anyone waste their time and money upgrading to Microsoft Windows Vista if it doesn't work right?  It is really frustrating because brand new PC games coming out right now and in the future aren't compatible with Microsoft Windows Vista.  If you don't believe me, go into different gaming web sites and read about all the problems people are having playing brand new PC games that just came out with Microsoft Window Vista.  Please Microsoft, fix Microsoft Windows Vista
I think this product is highly overated and this claimof being 99% accurate is false.Once in while it can amaze you by typing a sentence with 100% accuracy , but this enthusiasm is quickly dashed whenyou realise that the very next sentence is completegibberish which bears absolutely no relation to what yousaid and you wonder how it could have possibly interpetedwhat you have in that manner.I think this program maybe accent sensitive so that a person with an American accent may get good results while a person with a British or an Australian accent may get poor results for the same level of training.In summary I think the program is unreliable with anaccuracy of 45% at its present level of developement.It has plenty of potential and with future developement it could much more reliable but at its present level ofdevelopement I think the performance is mediocre.  
I will never buy another product from this manufacturer. I have a legal copy of this program, and on the weekend my motherboard died. I had to buy a new board then reinstall all my software, and when I got to DNS8 it told me I'd registered too many times and I had to buy a new copy.Hidden somewhere in the site I found reference to uninstalling the previous install whilst online to allow me to install it again. So, I dug out my old hard drive, set it up temporarily, connected to the internet and uninstalled. Went to the new machine and installed and ... no dice. Same message.This is the worst example of product activation, and when I went to customer support they wanted my credit card number in order to charge ME $9.95 to install a legally purchased product. I will now explore other means because I fully intend to use the software I paid a lot of money for.And in case anyone from the company ever reads this (unlikely), I'm going to use all my online clout to tell people just how annoyed I am. I only get one thousand three hundred unique visitors per day to my websites and blogs, but that adds up to quite a few people over a couple of months and you can be damn sure every one of them will hear about this. I once wrote a lengthy blog post praising your product. Now it's time for the addendum
G'day, I bought DNS 8 Standard to use mainly on trips so I could keep a diary of the trips.When I tried it, the voice recognition was so-so.  The worst part was that after about 3 pages the "file" fills up and you have to begin a new one.Now maybe there is a way around this, but I and no one else will be able to find out from Nuance.  Their customer [dis]service is down at the bottom of the Marianas Trench.  [I could make reference to whale droppings, but that wouldn't be polite.]I emailed them about this and was told to call for an answer.  However, that would be my one and only free call.I really think, Nuance needs competition.Hello there Microsoft
I bought this software because I really wanted to learn Spanish and be fluent. The price and marketing of the company made me believe that this package was the most complete package on the market.So I was very excited to receive it after spending $450 on a software. My excitement did not last long after that.I was shocked to see how the software itself looked, I was expecting a top of the line interface for the price I paid but that software seemed years old.But I still wanted to get my money worth so tried the first level for hours, even days, as I was convinced I could learn Spanish with it. I also tried the other 2 levels to make sure that my issue was not only with that first level.I had looked at the demo and noticed that most of the content was based on that same acitivity with the 4 pictures. I was expecting different exercises for the full version...The software gets so repetitive, I was really disappointed, even more because of the outrageous price of that package
This was a huge waste of money. If you have plans to make a custom animation, do not buy this.  Anime only alows you to manipulate one of their few charecters.  You can not change eye color or hair color.  If you want a good animation you have to go to one of their websites and purchase a character for $10- $20.  Their free ones are completly dumb. Using their "easy to use" bone rigging tool takes a long time to set up and use.  It took me ten minutes to make one for a stick figure. (which didn't work very well) You can't even group anything unless you buy their $180 upgraded version.  I  spent hours trying to use this, and could figure none of the above out.  It also took two weeks to get here instead of four days.  I don't recomend this to people who are looking for an easy to use animation creator.
Don't buy Vista--any version, yet.  MS released it WAY too early.  Some examples why:  * Too many hardware drivers not yet available, i.e., Creative Audigy  sound cards; Nvidia graphics cards, and Linksys wireless network components, just to mention a few.  When I contacted product manufacturers, I sensed a ho-hum attitude.  Moreover, some peripherals are totally incompatible.  Example:  My Epson Perfection 1650 scanner was rejected by Vista, so I was forced to buy a newer model (Epson Perfection 4990 Photo).  Hmmmm.  One wonders whether these sorts of incompatibilities result more by design (purposely?) than from insurmountable technological deficiencies.*  Too many Vista compatible application updates are not yet available. *  The "Upgrade" versions of MS Vista (versus the "full" versions) seem to be full of bugs.  Soon after I installed Vista Ultimate, I encountered a major problem that MS tech support has been trying to resolve for over two weeks.  It is so pervasive that MS Outlook 2007 has been affected to the extent that some of its features are not available.  It appears that during the installation process, something went awry with "Windows Event Log" and the "Event Viewer."  Furthermore, the latest version (Vista compatible) of Diskeeper 2007 Pro will not launch, most likely for the same reason. *  It appears MS went way overboard on security features to the extent of paranoia.  Every time you click on just about anything, a pop-up will appear asking your permission to "allow" it to launch.  Very annoying, and VERY unnecessary.  It's as though MS adopted an underlying assumption throughout the development process that the average end user has an IQ of about 85. *  MS tech support quality has deteriorated substantially.  Most of the time when you call you will reach someone in India.  Albeit these people are very polite, they cannot think "outside the box."  Nor are they in touch sufficiently enough with the nuances of the English language, thus impairing expeditious understanding on both sides of the conversation.  Based upon my recent experience with these folks, I sense that a soccer mom could be trained as a MS tech support rep in very little time. What I mean by that is this:  During my multiple contacts with them I developed the feeling they rely totally on reading from manuals, scripts, and on-line knowledge bases.  In other words, they seem not to be able to analyze and troubleshoot problems independent of external references.  * Bottom line:  Do NOT purchase Vista until AFTER service pack 1 is released, or whatever they happen to name their first major fix-it update package.  For now, stay with the more reliable XP versions.  I truly regret that I had to discover all of this the hard way.  It has been very costly in more ways than one.
I have used Turbo Tax for as long as I can remember.  I have always purchased their business and their personal tax products.  Generally I had been satisfied. However this year after spending much time over many months working on a complicated return, Turbo tax dumped all the data including that which was saved many times over several months. It corrupted all but 2kb of data and can't even open that. Of course you can't get a person via telephone or email.  I would give them o stars if that was an option. So long Intuit
This was my first year using Turbotax, and it's also my last!Since 1992 I was a faithful user of HR Block's Taxcut for Mac.  In spite of it costing more than the Windows version, I used it every year except for 1995 when various problems related to my AOL dial-up service prevented me from using it.  Since TurboTax is the only option out there for people who use a Mac, you'd think I'd be continuing to use them for now on, - but you'd be wrong!I purchased my copy of TurboTax Deluxe from Amazon.com to save $5.  Since TaxCut made certain that no information from it's software could ever be imported by other software, I filled in my personal data as I began.  I was a little disappointed that TurboTax doesn't allow you to skip the "step-by-step" method, and just fill in the actual forms the way TaxCut did as an option.    While the downloads were an annoyance (6 or 7 separate files each time), for the most part the software was OK.  Picking up from where you leave off wasn't always possible, but 5 or 6 clicks would get you back to the right spot.My first major annoyance came with the state software.  After filling in some data, and seeing the overall results, I wanted to look at the forms to see what they were doing with my data.  I also needed to see where they had placed data that was imported from the federal information I'd entered.  Well, there's no way to see your data on state forms until you're finished and print them out (or preview as .pdf files from the print dialogue).  When you do that the software somehow magically creates the state forms for printing, but the state forms don't seem to exist anywhere else except in that print spool!  I found this extremely annoying, and a real time waster.The final blow, however, was when I got to filing.  The advertising is an unnecessary annoyance.  Since I don't owe any state taxes, I just usually print those forms out and mail them in --- it doesn't make any sense to me to pay for filing something when I don't owe anything and I'm not going to benefit from that "faster" refund.  Then I came to the crusher.  TurboTax wanted $30 for e-filing my Federal forms!!  TaxCut charged $14.95 and $15.95, but then they always rebated the cost.  I was told that Intuit used to do that, but obviously they decided to make some additional money this year.  Earlier in the day that I filed the saw the head of the IRS on CNBC being interviewed. He said that e-filing makes their job so much simpler.  Well, if it helps them that much, they should devise a way for computer users who buy software to file returns directly to the IRS without Intuit, H R Block and the others as middlemen.  And they should let us file for free if it makes their work so much easier.While I have had my doubts about the services that allow you to fill out online forms, and then do your filing for you, I haven't heard of any security problems with them, so that's the direction I'm planning to take next year.  As far as I'm concerned, TurboTax blew it by being unfair with their e-filing fees
I have used Intuit products since 1992, and was quite satisfied until 4 years ago when Intuit began installing hidden software on users' computers in an attempt to "stop piracy", which caused numerous problems for us honest users who paid for the program. Secondly and even more significantly, I began noticing an apparent shift in Intuit's philosophy toward it's customers: cut back on customer support, and attempt to exploit them at every possible opportunity in order to make more money.In short, Intuit disrespects their customers.As a loyal paying customer, I will not be disrespected or taken for granted. Their level of service and support has declined. Their products constantly pimp you to spend more money on Intuit as you try to use their programs.That is why I have sworn off Intuit products when there is an alternative.  Why reward someone who treats you badly?
if you have used the online version in the past, stick with it. buying it on disk does not allow you to import data from previous returns if done on line and you can not upload to myturbotax. almost as if two separate companies! plus the User interface on this software stinks bigtime. very hard to navigate back and forth. online version is actually better (though i didn't try it this year). does intuit actually employ programmers or watch real users? they spend far too much money on useless features like videos and not enough on simple ui issues
I have been using Turbo Tax since 1998, I use computers every day, and (as an engineer) I am used to using difficult applications (Pro-E, Mathcad, UG, etc). This years edition of Turbo Tax Deluxe was the worst Turbo tax I have ever seen ( I usually like it very much). I purchased in January and had to update 4 times. One update took 6 hours (some of us live in the boonies and broadband is not an option). In addition, the application brought up menus and selections that were not applicable (farm income at the PA State form). When I tried to delete the entries (at the Federal level as instructed) they would not. My 1 business expense entry kept getting duplicated ("copy 2" and every time I deleted it, it would reappear on the next pass through. Every time I entered the "State" tab, it acted like I was never there before with a "Start State" button that always lead me through all the same questions (It did retain my answers from prior visits). Where was the "Continue State" button? I also noticed that using the "back" button and then moving foreward again caused never before seen dialogs to occur, even though the same "foreward" choices were made. Once I backed up to check something  then moving foreward caused my state tax status to jump from +$46 to -$1548!! Upon backing up I saw that some of the check boxes regarding the sale of my home were unchecked. I did not check them, but rather backed up two more screens, then moved foreward again the two screens and the boxes were again checked! One more foreward click and my taxes again returned to +$46. One of the years I liked best was when there was a "checklist" so you could see where you had been and what was already addressed. This years State was definetly worse than the Federal, but even that was a dissapointment. I did complete this years filings  submitted both online, I hope I don't get burned! Turbo Tax!-- Please improve for next year or it may be my last year. You realize that at 59.95 + 39.95 filing + my time + aggravation like this year, and an accountant is looking attractive. If you are on the "inside" you probably know why this is happening...outsourcing code gen to India, not  outsourcing code gen to India, programmer cut-backs, programming application changes, archiving application changes, project management issues, whatever. Just realize that there is a problem  fix it
Since Tax Cut decided not to produce a Mac version this year, I got stuck with Turbo Tax.  Their website promises that one may import data from the previous year's Tax Cut return.  Then you buy the thing, and you find out that it requires you to load the Turbo Tax program and your 2004 Tax Cut data onto a Windows machine, transfer there, then load it back onto the Mac for this to work.  So, like a chump I borrowed a friend's windows machine and did all this.  But, it doesn't work.  Not at all.  And it takes a lot of time to find that out.  Tried every workaround I could think of.  Nope.  It doesn't work. 
For federal returns this is a generally usable product with a very poor User Interface and Help system,   For state returns this product falls below the bar of "usable".  I have used the principle competitor, "Tax Cut: in the past and have found it to have generally a poor UI, but it was significantly better than Turbo Tax.Some examples of the poor User Interface experience are:*	If you enter the employer ID number from a W-2 in an attempt to retrieve it from the internet and the retrieve fails, then you are asked to re-enter the same ID number when you enter the W-2 information manually.*	Investment Sales: I have about 20 stocks I've sold over the past year, but the window only shows 3 at a time (with a scrollbar).*	On the form page, Schedule D-1 (the continuation form for stock sales) is displayed on the screen with scrollbar if the number of items exceeds the window height, but the scroll bar would not let me scroll to the bottom 2 entries.  Printing these out does however show them*	When entering a stock sale, you can indicate it is worthless to which Turbo tax will tell you that it will set the sale date to 12/31, regardless of what you entered in compliance with IRS rules.   So on my next stock that was worthless I tried to not enter a sale data knowing it would just override it, but the program insisted I enter a sale data, only to then immediately override it.*	Entering Federal information was usually clear enough, but an obvious lack of effort is shown in the state returns (PA in my case).  Cryptic questions are asked with no explanation and no useful help.  For example "Enter adjustment to income, and indicate type of adjustment -- the choice for type include OID, ABP, etc. with no explanation of what these are!.  It is not clear whether the amount of the "adjustment" should be an absolute or a delta. Requesting help brings up a screen on an irrelevant topic (penalties for early withdrawal of savings).*	On my state return, it dragged me through 3 screens for EVERY stock sale I made.   (about 20 of them - so 60 screens).  Since it already had the info from the federal return I was doing nothing other than clicking Continue over and over. Much better would be to present me with a table of all the sales and ask me to check the information there.*	It transferred information about my stock sales from my Federal to my state return.  However I was only a part year resident of the state and it made no attempt to either calculate, or warn me, that many of the sales would not be taxable events in that state because they were sold when I was not a resident of that state.In conclusion, while Turbo Tax ultimately did help me get the job done, I think I'll try going back to TaxCut next year
After purchasing this product, I found there were several problems with scanning. I contacted Nuance (who purchased ScanSoft) to ask for assistance from Technical Support. However, I then learned they want $9.95 for each incident when a request is made by email. Not by phone - by email. After putting out a great deal of money for this product, I should not have to pay $9.95 for assistance with each issue that is a problem with their product. Save yourself a great deal of grief and avoid this product. I regret that Amazon does not allow me to give this product "0" stars.
I was a real fan of omnipage until this version. The scanning speed is slug like. The proof reading function has is less functional the version 14, and it tends to forget the scanner settings.No noticable new features where added from version 14, and this seems to be a new version for the sake of milking the client base
If you spend a good deal of your time doing OCR on books skip this program. It is even slower than the previous version (which was tortoise-like) still screws up the order of columns, is very bad at reading mixed numbers and letters, Takes forever to move through long documents, and just genreally makes you feel like you are back to using a 486 when you are working on a pentium 4. Oh, and don't be fooled by the claim that it can actually create fillable forms. It will take you less time to create it from scratch in Word than to scan it in and then fix all the errors. I'm switching to Kurzweil
I've used Omnipage 12 and 14 and got the latest version to convert an out of print book to a text pdf.  Nothing really fancy, two column text mostly w pictures and captions plus 3 tables. Using this software was a nightmare.  The OCR worked better than the previous version BUT it showed mixed fonts on the page (two column text w a title about 1/3 down and above the text).  No problem I thought, I'll just use the wysiwyg (what you see if what you get) text editor to fix this..it looks very nice w some good features.  Well, wysiyg is more like wysiwyDON'Tget.  I'd fix the fonts, save the file, open it in adobe reader and find that Omnipage had made some startling changes in the fonts/size and the titles.  I tried for 3 hrs to get a simple table of contents page w just a title and 8 lines (each w text followed by a page number)...no go.  Plus the wysiwyg editor would sometimes inexplicably throw me into 'replace text' mode while I was trying to insert text and I couldn't get out.In frustration I used a friends machine w Abby Finereader 7.0 Pro...what a welcome change.  OCR was at least as fast and accurate and the editor, while not as feature laden as Omnipages, actually worked!  I did in 6 hrs what I'd been trying for well over 12 to do in Omnipage..and that was w/o going thru any of the tutorial info..just loaded it and started.  I'm buying Abby for my next project, they've upgraded to 8.0 and I'll bet it's editor delivers what Omnipage only promises.  I wouldn't recommend Omnipage 15 Pro to anyone
I bought this to convert some .AVI and .MOV files so I could try video podcasting with a web multimedia class I teach.  I've done this successfully with a shareware product, but thought the resulting video could be a little sharper, so I was willing to pay for and try a commerical product.  (Pinnacle, right?  They do a lot of this stuff, they must know what they're doing . . . . )  HA!!!!  HUGE mistake.  The interface is horrible, and the conversion just-plain-sucks.  Everything came out in flouescent colors with huge blocks covering the screen.  Totally, completely unwatchable.  It looks like a 60s psychedellic experience, like "motion art," not like a proper video at all.  Avoid this product!!
I bought this, installed it, patched it, and then started going through the rather incomplete and disorganized documentation. The examples I played around with all worked fine. I started writing my own program, a simple math game with basic sprites and speech. I wrote a simple speech and graphics routine, which mostly worked. I wanted to try to figure out why one of my functions was going into an infinite loop and so I started the Debug mode, so I could watch what the variables were doing (very simple, basic, and common programming practice). Blat - debug mode crashes. Debug mode works on much simpler programs and for the few examples I tried out, but on my 200 line routine it generates exceptions. After the crash, I opened my project and found that everything I had written in my source had been reverted to an old version. I know for a fact that it was saved many times since then, but for some reason it decided to recall an old version for loading, as if all my Saves after an arbitrary point never happened. If I can't run debug mode on my programs or save my sources, then what's the point of this software? Complete and total buggy garbage
I purchased this item from Amazon.  The disc had scratches and was unable to either use it or get my money back.  These items can not be returned
Don't be fooled by the box saying how many they've sold anyone who knows anything about software knows you cannot return an opened software box so sold means nothing.This software in unimpressive, I bought it because I needed to do my wedding invitation and I liked the description thinking I could use it for may other things as well.Well I ended up using WORD for my invitations, yes WORD, why because word actually did everything I wanted that this program said it would do but didn't! I spent HOURS trying to use it's "simple" templates to no avail they would not print correctly or in the size they claimed to be. In the end I am out the money I spent and pretty mad about it
I bought this to protect my new Dell Axim, a replacement for my Palm Tungsten E (and a step up).  The Axim is wireless enabled so I wanted to protect it.  When I tried to install it, I ran into major issues.  It automatically wanted to install to the Palm (seeing the Palm Desktop software).  There was NO way to override it or choose which device to which it should install.  I contacted Customer Service (an issue in itself) via phone and email.  Emailed response told me to uninstall my Palm software.  How stupid!  I have no intention of uninstalling the Palm just yet.  Meanwhile, trying to PHONE Customer Service was a joke.  I tried a few times, once spending over 60 minutes on hold, another over 90 minutes, with no human contact.  I have a business to run, not plenty of time to waste!  Maybe it works great, but the complications of trying to install prevented me from ever finding out.  Amazon was terrific and let me return the product
BE CAREFUL - If you buy this version of Symantec Antivirus for Handhelds -IT WILL NOT WORK WITH MICROSOFT MOBILE 2005.  Supposedly Symantec Antivirus for Handhelds. Version 3.5 will work with Mobile 2005
I Purchased this product in Nov 2006. Reviews at other sites indicated this was a wonderful product, the very best, editor reviews - not user - the product is to new I guess. I looked at the specs and it had features which looked very appealing, so I thought I would try it - Bummer. Acronis 10 installs fine, sets up a file system on a seperate physical drive and appears to work, until you verify the images, all are corrupted. I have contacted Acronis several times, they have given me several test tools to find out what might be wrong.  Nothing has been resolved after 4 1/2 months. The tools and debuging has shown no errors in my hardware.  I have to keep using Ghost-2003 to do my images, it works fine. Acronis support acts like its a unheard of problem, but I now find references all over the Internet about this image corruption problem going back to version 6
This product is a huge waste of time.  It loaded easily enough, looks friendly, and is feature rich but it just doesn't work !  And support is awful.  Biggest problem is it just would make a good back up image.  Burned many dvd's and the program kept telling me the files were corrupted.  In most cases, I couln't even get confirmation of that.  The program did something to my DVD drive.  It would ask me to swap a spanned set, yet disable my drive !  Process had to be cancelled, whole system rebooted just to get access to my dvd drive again.  When I tried manually checking the files they wouldn't open.  Explore or mounting the images kept requiring a "password".  But I don't use passwords !  Made sure the settings were all password free.  Stick with Norton Ghost !!!!!
this software never worked after installation using the cd i bought it ask me to extend my preview " your preview using this feature has expired to continue using purchase the full version today"I have tried to contact the seller in vain. This is very unfortunite for such people to continue hacking customers money with under rated product
This software is fine for altering digital pictures if you do not have any other programs, but if you want to make exciting slideshows, this software is very basic and not user-friendly.  I had technical problems from the start.  You are better off using MS Powerpoint than this software
this product is extremely difficult to learn. I recently purchased two more expensive manuals ro learn the process and also the tutorials the company has are beyond the average users learning.
I received the bundle but there is no installation key for Shade LE.I noticed the someone else's review stating this same problem is no longer visible so I figured I'd post it again
...buy it here and save $s!Shipping cost from the UK added $46.95 to the price AND a Foreign Debit Card Transaction fee of $2.51 for a waste of $49.46 that could have been spent getting additional models.Or get the download version and save even more as like someone else pointed out, the included manual is near useless and has not improved since version 4. Practical Poser 6 is still the best book to get if you are serious about doing Poser 6 development
I installed Adobe 8.0 at the request of a client in order to view secure docments on-line.  Two serious problems were caused by this: 1) Window 2000 Outlook runing under XP would crash after the Adobe reader was launched. Closing the reader and restarting Outlook would not always fix the problem. Often the computer would require a cold re-boot. 2). More serious, Adobe 8 installation corrupted my Agilent Technologies Genesys 8 and later (Eagleware) RF simulation software tools.  This resulted in the Genesys simulator to fail to find the authentication file.  Because the correlation between installing Adobe was not apparent considerable amount of time was lost on this project.  Adobe also causes problems with OrCAD 15 license server.I have currently un-installed Adobe 8 had to re-install and patch previously installed Microsoft and enginnering software tools.
Please see reviews of the previous version 7.0. The Adobe activation process can cause a lot of continuing problems for legitimate users of this software. Too bad such good software is hampered by such a process. Being in the software business, I don't mind companies worrying about piracy and taking some measures but this is a bit too much. You might need to allow the software to access the internet regularly to keep your activation (and not bother you with notices of reactivation) but that also means you open it for Adobe to do their push marketing into their software. I have used Adobe products for over 15 years and have always liked them. Too bad, they have lost the customer focus in their rage for software piracy and greed for intrusive marketing
TaxCut did not warn me that I needed to fill out additional forms required for taking the exemption for a qualified child, nor did it lead me through the Schedule C like TurboTax does. TurboTax may be more expensive, but it's well worth it to save the headaches that this program caused. If you have complicated tax forms or unusual tax situations (or prefer an intuitive program, rather than something that makes you say "What am I supposed to do next???") stick with TurboTax
This program has a bug in processing 1099-R data that makes the whole software package useless to me.  After filling in the data from my 2005 1099-R form, the program informed me that these monies were taxable in 2003 not 2005, and that these data would not be included in my 2005 return.  I could not find a way overide this problem. Also, there was no apparent way to directly contact H Block to find out how to fix it.  After wasting a couple of hours I now have to trash the taxcut software and spend more money to purchase turbo-tax, which from prior years experience is relatively bug free.
I got the hang on the 21% and all they could tell me at tech support is to shut down extra services. Well the only services I had running was the security services (firewall and antivirus). As an experiment I tried loading it on two computers set up identically. On one I shut down the antivirus and on the other I shut down the firewall. Neither would install. So I shut down both on both computers and it installed perfectly on both. I cant believe that they want you to shut down security in order to install. Makes me wonder.."What are they hiding that they dont want me to know about". I checked adaware and a registry cleaner and even ran my AV again and found nothing but still... It makes you wonder. Also the layout is very poor, so buggy they have many, MANY patches and updates. Will not print forms correctly and want to charge you fees to e-file when it is free from the governments. They just want more money. In my opinion...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP. BY THE TIME YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY ON GETTING THIS TO WORK, YOU CAN GET A PROFESSIONAL TO DO IT FOR YOU FOR LESS
Unfortunately, this application includes only a Mac OS 9 (not the Mac OS X as advertised) version.  I cannot review the cds in general, as I cannot run them.  Why did they re-publish the 1998 software in 2006, again in Mac OS 9?  Frustrating
This dictionary is not for the person who English is his second language. It does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word. In addtion, the micro doesn't work well with MS Word.
I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery!  When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also!  VERY BAD!  I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out
This is the worst thing I have ever bought. I bought it because I am having some trouble in spanish in school. I bought it thinking that if I gave a english word it would give you the spanish word or vise versa. But all it does is give you the definition and does not give you the english word.So save your self 20 dollars and don't buy thi
Although this dictionary's contents are extensive, the screen functions are relics from the DOS era.  They are laborious and clumsy.  To find a word for difinition, it has to be spelled perfectly, there's no list of proximations to the word entered.  Changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn't show up in the entry slot. If someone knows of a better software, I'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks!!  Maria McGowan 
I have been using FrontPage since 1997.  I am webmaster for three websites and have alway really thought this was a great program!  BUT!  I have only upgraded to FrontPage 2000 and find that with my XP computer, Win XP does not support FrontPage.  Now, if I want to continue with my family Genealogy Site and a community Genealogical Society site, I will need to purchase and learn ANOTHER program.  At age 70, I really don't feel like doing that!Does anyone know if FP 2003 will work on Win XP?  OR  How can I get my FP 2000 to work on my WIN XP computer?
I am not a 'professional,' but figured out how to build a website with this program, which I bought thinking that it was going to help me produce more professional-looking websites/pages, and I invested a bunch of other money in how-to books I'd ordered here, and lo and behold, the server with which I have a website I maintain for my city gov't does NOT support any sites made with this program, and then I find that NEITHER DOES YAHOO where I have my personal site and have been promoting to the city to move their official website to!!!  I've apparently wasted a lot of money and had NO CLUE this would happen when I finally put a website together with this program.  I never would have imagined Yahoo would not support the most current page builders, but it could be they want to force people to use their wizards.  WHY would Microsoft not have a patch available or something to fix this problem so this program can be used for more than just my entertainment spending hours and hours trying to learn it and build something, then find out it was for NOTHING???  Of course, both the server with the city website and Yahoo work with versions up to 2002....but I can't invest another over-$100 for the old version now just for that.  Yeah, it's great....made a pretty page, but only I can see it.  If I could publish with it, I wouldn't have just given it one star here
I gave this a 2nd star for a support call ms provided.  If you do have a frontpage server, and have it set "on", it had some advantages over ftp.I bought it for use on our family website which is mainly pictures.  I've used 6-8 programs for creating galleries over the years.  I think a perl script using Linux' mogrify worked best.  This works worst!  The free ones w/ the digital cameras beat it.  Frontpage is missing the most fundamental piece to view photos-  A next/previous button.  You can choose from several thumbnail displays including a cool mosaic/colage type thing.  Once you expand it, you must remember the shot you were on, back up, and then click on the next one!  Unbelievable.  I know what I need for handling photos efficiently.  Flicr has it- cross-tab indexing of the same photo.  I think picassa is close and getting closer.  This wasn't worth the cost of Picassa- FREE
Have tried about six times to install it.  I've followed all of the online troubleshooting advice, all to no avail.  It says it installed with three nonfatal errors and five warnings.  It tells you to check the log.  Well, there are over 85k entries and even if I found the errors I don't see any way to correct the errors. When I try to run it I get "starter MFC Application has encountered a problem and needs to close".  I'll be returning this puppy to Amazon for a replacement
i am underwhelmed with the dvd-rom from britannica. it ia a waste of time and money. their main object is to sell britannica with snatches to createinterest.these dvd-roms should be sent free to arouse interest. i now own two dvds and both are unsatisfactory.
EB own words: "Unfortunately, at this time the Britannica software is not compatible with Windows Vista. We are working on developing another version of the 2007 software that will work on Windows Vista and we are planning to release this version in the upcoming months. Please check back with us in another month or so and we should have some more information about the Vista-compatible software. But, it is entirely possible that we will not have Windows Vista compatible version of the 2007 product available and that we will wait until the development of the 2008 software." They do NOT offer a reasonable on-line subscription
Since most of the complaints are from recent switchers I went ahead and bought this because most of their problems don't apply to me (running on PowerPC, no old data to transfer), and because intuit offers a 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee.  Oh, and i downloaded it from their site, saving like 5 bucks.Here's the thing.  The QFX file that quicken uses to get data from financial institutions is restricted.  My bank offers the download, so i can get the file just fine.  However, part of quicken's import process is an internet check with the bank to see if they "support" mac users.  By support, all that really means is the bank pays quicken to allow mac users to import their QFX files.  If not, you get an error message saying to try the import again later.  There is a hack floating around the 'net that invloves changing some of the text in the QFX file, and it works.  BUT there are cheaper alternatives out there that support the format (moneydance is one) with no fuss.Aside from this issue, the interface is really bad. It looks like a check register.  If I wanted a glorified spreadsheet in the shape of my checkbook, i would have made one.  The program is not even close to intuitive, which means if you dislike/avoid tracking your finances like me this software will scare you away pretty effectively, making your purchase pointless.Lastly, the customer support is really very bad.  You basically get canned responses that don't even really address the questions you ask, in semi-broken English.I'm sure that someone with banks that have mac supported QFX, tons of patience, and is predisposed to dealing with accounting minutiae would find this program useful/powerful.  For me, all the advanced features in the world don't matter if i can't even use the most basic ones
I've been using Quicken for Windows for years.  Since I recently bought a Mac, I thought I'd switch Quicken over from Mac to Windows.  Forget it!  The Mac version is totally incompatible with Windows, you must export your data and then re-import it on the Mac.  This works OK for simple checking / Visa accounts, but it **fails completely** for investment or brokerage accounts.  If you look on Quicken's support site, they say "Reinvest Dividend, Reinvest Income and banking transactions in an investment account must be *manually entered*"  Hello?!  Like I'm going to manually enter 12 years of investment transactions?  With most major products (Adobe Creative Suite, MS Office), the same files work transparently across Mac and Windows.  Quicken's inability to even import the data, nevermind actually opening it, reeks of incompetence.  Stay away from this product
Intuit charges banks extra to support Mac users, and many banks don't pay.  So the convenience of automated transaction downloads is impossible for me on Quicken Mac.  Several other features are lagging behind the Windows version.  And for some inexplicable reason, transferring data between Quicken for Windows and Quicken for Mac isn't complete or straightfoward.I haven't used competing products, but for Mac users I recommend either running the Windows Quicken version (using Boot Camp or Parallels) or buying another product.  And by all means, let Intuit know that their pricing practices are costing them customers
I purchased this product thinking that it would revolutionize my financial organization -but I should have known better after I have started to read all of the product reviews.I can't even give a thorough review, since I can't seem to get past even downloading my savings  checking information from my bank.  The incorrect balances are showing, and the register doesn't show all of the transactions that my banking website shows.  I'm finding that I have to actually check my banking website to cross-check Quicken!  To me, that ain't so quick.I've just spent over 45 minutes on an online "chat" - which was more of a waste of time than anything.  The customer's support suggestions pretty much entailed deleting files, restarting, deleting files, restarting.10 minutes ago, he wrote this:Ashish R.: Thank you.Ashish R.:  Please  give me 2 minutes only.Stacey: I think I would just like to return the product...Stacey: It isn't working...Stacey: are you still there?Stacey: Right...Stacey: Hello?I'm still sitting here waiting.  I want to return this product - DO NOT BUY! 
I've been using Quicken for over a decade, and I have to admit it is critical to my personal financial management.  But I had no reason to upgrade from Quicken 2004 until Intuit decided to "break" it and force the upgrade by crippling certain features.  Quicken 2007 for Mac's feature set is not significantly different from the 2004 version, much less 2005 or 2006, and is certainly inferior to Quicken for Windows.  That's bad enough but Quicken 2007 is also WAY less stable than my prior version (I'm using the R2 update).  It crashes frequently.  Bottom line, Intuit should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for putting this garbage on the market.  I for one will never buy another one of their products and recommend the same for everyone else out there
I have to agree with all these reviews already posted. I was getting error messages for Intuit stating that I would not be able to download stock quotes after a certain date, so I ordered a new copy of Quicken for $50 thinking it would be an upgrade. To my amazement, it is exactly the same as Quicken 04, no real developments. I feel very cheated by Intuit. If 04 was only going to be good for a couple of years, they should have disclosed the fact in the first place. If they are going to squeeze money out of loyal customers, I would at least expect and improved product. They are making a real mistake here, as their credibility is now zip. I have been buying TurboTax every year, and have been a loyal Quicken user for many years, but now I think I will look for something else.
I ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two.  After applying one vial, it seemed even worse than before.  (Tread "catches" as I walk.)  So I applied the second vial just to make it usuable.  (Still not great.)  This stuff is overpriced and either they don't give you enough or it's poor quality
This stuff has a very strong smell -- like WD-40 or something.  If you can stand the smell, you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store -- at least then you'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt.I bought this stuff because I thought it would be odorless, like all other treadmill lubricant I've bought.  But it isn't odorless.  It really stinks.  I don't like that permeating smell in my house, especially in my workout room.I recommend the LifeSpan 100% silicone lubricant.  It's a little pricier for the quantity you receive, but it's the good (odorless) stuff
I purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine. Unfortunetly, the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical. I would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment
...for more than a couple of minutes (no matter what I did) and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink.  Overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke.  I've gotten much better results for the same money with other products
The suction cups do not work on many toilet seats. Though the idea is great, save your money unless you have some to burn
This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you.My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item. Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it.I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper)Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap. Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl. Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it.I don't think no one will die from this type of trick
I thought this would be an actual toilet monster, and was happy to see such a low price. It is, however, made out of rubber, and can not actually eat people
I consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds.  I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big.  I think that for a "small" backpack, that they are just too large.  Thank you
I returned this item, as it didn't fit my 19-pound Boston Terrier well at all. It was way too large for his body. "Small" obviously means small for a larger dog instead. Just be aware!
Absolutely no use to me whatsoever. Next
I purchased the ab lounge 2 online, but returned it the same day.It's too bulky  heavy.  I wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news, but it's too heavy to move around, and it DOES NOT FOLD.   I put it together in my living room, and then tried to get it into my bedroom BUT IT WOULDN'T FIT THROUGH THE DOOR.  I had to un-screw the bars, fold  pull it through the door.If I had put the AB Lounge 2 downstairs, then I would never use it.Unless you want the "AB LOUNGE 2" to be a "PERMANENT" fixture in your bedroom or living room, then I would order something else.I need this thing to be where I can easily use it  then put it away.......The Ab Lounge 2 is way too big  bulky for that.Unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture, then don't buy it.I'm buying the "Ultra" Ab Lounge because it folds for easy storage....It's more expensive, but to me it's worth the convenience of having the "EASY" storage capability.I don't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it's not in use.
I tried this last year, and by the second day I woke up in great pain. I tried it again a few weeks later hoping it wasn't the juice that caused the pain the first time, and the same thing happened. I give it 2 stars because I actually did lose a few pounds on this stuff
I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.
This product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit.  What it doesn't say is that you really get a workout.  No matter what incline it is in, it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil.  If you want a strenuous workout, then this unit is for you.  If you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface, then this is NOT the unit for you
I guess you get what you pay for.This pedometer was difficult to calibrate, and continued to miscount steps, and therefore distance, covered.It is made of plastic, and came unclipped easily.I am a big person, and have started walking to improve my health. This product does not work for me, although it might be a different story for a slim person.It has been relegated to the junk drawer, and probably will eventually be thrown away. I'll have to find another that works better and purchase it
Initially, the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate. It did, however, give my wife a good laugh; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the TV remote. But after one week of use, the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when I jumped up and down like a pogo stick. Pass on this one
Not worth the shipping cost.  Completely flawed.  I ordered the Oregon Scientific, which is perfect.  Should be Zero Stars.Dr. Parha
I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.  The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.   The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.)Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.  This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue
We bought our machine 2 weeks ago. It looks wonderful, nice sturdy, with alot of different features, but we haven't been able to use it. It didn't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with Ironman's Customer Service Department ever since. They keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up. Evertime we call their 1800 number we're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day. Well after 2 weeks, we've had it! We're taking it back and never buying another Ironman product again. They're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they won't get anyone out there to fix it? Nothing against the store, they've been great. Just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer
The first time I used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they're made out of cracked in three different places.  Perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely, but I'm not going to risk an injury finding out.  In the trash they go... I suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing
This does not fit on Super 9 rifles as far as I know.  Besides, it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny! (Most scopes are whatever zoom X30. For example, I own a 3-9X44 scope. This means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom.  The second number refers to the size of the scope lens.  I'd seriously reccomend a 3X30 if you can get one.  Also make sure it's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail.  If you are getting it for the Super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight (peephole)
I purchased this bike rack because I was moving out of state and didn't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike.  I also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails, parks, etc.  So, I went with Schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive.  I drove from NC to Fla, approx 700 miles, bad idea with this rack.  I didn't have any trouble assembling the rack, only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go.  However, during my trip, I had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back.  The buckles do NOT hold the straps in place.  This is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway (or any busy road) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic.  Also, even if the buckles hold, The wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame.  I had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back (and yes, the rack was assembled correctly).  Bottom line, this rack is probably a great value if don't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph, otherwise, it is a a complete waste.      
I bought this model a year ago, and replaced the deck after approximately 8 months.  Just recently, the deck cracked again.  Of course the warrantly no longer applies.  Save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and spend a little extra to upgrade to a better brand.

I am 6'1 and this jump rope was too short for me, it says that its adujustable, but it can only be made shorter and not longer.  For a kid this is a good jump rope, but its definitely not for a tall person
Billy is great, full of energy and enthusiam.  I get great results from his workout much better than any other instructor. My family get great results from his workout.  His customer service rep were helpful.HOWEVER, I strongly, strongly recommend ordering your Taebo products through Amazon.  I've been doing business with Amazon many years and have placed over 150 orders.  I never, never once had any problems with my orders at Amazon.  When I had questions, it's amazing at not only how quick Amazon will reply but will give a long thorough and kind explanation.  Because they reply within a day and take so much time with the response, it shows they truly care for you and want to give you the best service possible.  I've never found customer service of this  very high and rare quality.In November of 2005, after ordering the Billy Bands from the official Billy Bank's website.  I was sent a package, without my permission from the company that contained Billy's energy formula supplements.  It was a 14 day delayed bill for 31.85.  I was upset this was sent without me knowing but here's the worse part.  I contacted customer service, a gentleman told me don't worry you haven't been billed just send us back the package and we'll credit you $5 into your account for the shipping, packaging, and mailing cost you pay out of your own pocket to have the items sent back.  Within a few days I send the product I never requested back.  Twice by phone and once by email from 3 different cust rep I was told I would receive a $5 credit to my bank account within 7 to 10 days.I was already upset about this matter but it wasn't that big of a concern.  However, about 2 weeks well over 10 days I never received the $5 credit to my account.  But there was a charge taken from their company without my permisson or authorization from my own personal bank account for $8.97 .  A few days later the $8.97 was put back into my account.When I contacted the company this is their reply: Thank you for your recent e-mail. We apologize for the inconvenience. Our records show that your vitamin shipment was on a 14 day delay billing cycle (I sent the item I never wanted back in 7 days not over the 14 day limit). This means that when the charges actually went through, you were only charged for a small portion of the amount that showed on the invoice (I kept the copy and nowhere on the invoice is this stated). You received a credit for the shipping and handling plus 5.00 dollars to ship it back too. This means, when the charge for the vitamins actually went through you were only charged for 8.97. This is also the refund that you have received, the amount paid (again since the item was sent back within 14 days I shouldn't have been charged and nowhere on the invoice is this stated that I would only be charged a small portion).So basically they sent me a product I never requested.  Told me they would give me some money to have the product sent back.  Took money from my bank account without me knowing and paid me back with my own money they stolen.To sum it up, do business with Amazon!
I bought the set in a rush without reading the reviews, big mistake! The Cardio Boot Camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing.  The beginner boot camp is boring though the advanced is challenging fun.  If I knew what wasn't included I wouldn't have bought it.  They should list what's not included in the description.  It seems somewhat deceptive
I bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching TV...I wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive.  What it boils down to is that this is a "foot hook" tied to a bar with a nylon strap.  The nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly.  The idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches...the problem is that the nylon strap doesn't actually hold your feet down.  I wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room.  Negative on both accounts.  You need a good sturdy door to implement this product, and then it still doesn't truly hold your feet down.  Looks like I'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down

I was promised 1-2 day shipping and didn't get it.  I was promised reciept by Dec. 6th and haven't gotten it
In the beginning the led seemed to stay bright for a considerable amount of time, but now after almost no use (except fooling with it) it doesn't remain lit for even 5 minutes. Very very poor buy
This stuff has a very strong smell -- like WD-40 or something.  If you can stand the smell, you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store -- at least then you'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt.I bought this stuff because I thought it would be odorless, like all other treadmill lubricant I've bought.  But it isn't odorless.  It really stinks.  I don't like that permeating smell in my house, especially in my workout room.I recommend the LifeSpan 100% silicone lubricant.  It's a little pricier for the quantity you receive, but it's the good (odorless) stuff
I purchased the ab lounge 2 online, but returned it the same day.It's too bulky  heavy.  I wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news, but it's too heavy to move around, and it DOES NOT FOLD.   I put it together in my living room, and then tried to get it into my bedroom BUT IT WOULDN'T FIT THROUGH THE DOOR.  I had to un-screw the bars, fold  pull it through the door.If I had put the AB Lounge 2 downstairs, then I would never use it.Unless you want the "AB LOUNGE 2" to be a "PERMANENT" fixture in your bedroom or living room, then I would order something else.I need this thing to be where I can easily use it  then put it away.......The Ab Lounge 2 is way too big  bulky for that.Unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture, then don't buy it.I'm buying the "Ultra" Ab Lounge because it folds for easy storage....It's more expensive, but to me it's worth the convenience of having the "EASY" storage capability.I don't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it's not in use.
I tried this last year, and by the second day I woke up in great pain. I tried it again a few weeks later hoping it wasn't the juice that caused the pain the first time, and the same thing happened. I give it 2 stars because I actually did lose a few pounds on this stuff
Got the mat for free for ordering the Series 7 treadmill and while putting the mat under my treadmill it ripped.  It is made by this rubbery plastic, and it's just okay.  I wouldn't pay $100 for it, it's true, but I was very disappointed that it ripped so easily.  Not very durable... but I got mine for free, so I guess I wasn't too surprised it was given away.
I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.
This product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit.  What it doesn't say is that you really get a workout.  No matter what incline it is in, it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil.  If you want a strenuous workout, then this unit is for you.  If you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface, then this is NOT the unit for you
I guess you get what you pay for.This pedometer was difficult to calibrate, and continued to miscount steps, and therefore distance, covered.It is made of plastic, and came unclipped easily.I am a big person, and have started walking to improve my health. This product does not work for me, although it might be a different story for a slim person.It has been relegated to the junk drawer, and probably will eventually be thrown away. I'll have to find another that works better and purchase it
Initially, the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate. It did, however, give my wife a good laugh; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the TV remote. But after one week of use, the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when I jumped up and down like a pogo stick. Pass on this one
Not worth the shipping cost.  Completely flawed.  I ordered the Oregon Scientific, which is perfect.  Should be Zero Stars.Dr. Parha
I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.  The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.   The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.)Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.  This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue
We bought our machine 2 weeks ago. It looks wonderful, nice sturdy, with alot of different features, but we haven't been able to use it. It didn't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with Ironman's Customer Service Department ever since. They keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up. Evertime we call their 1800 number we're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day. Well after 2 weeks, we've had it! We're taking it back and never buying another Ironman product again. They're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they won't get anyone out there to fix it? Nothing against the store, they've been great. Just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer
The first time I used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they're made out of cracked in three different places.  Perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely, but I'm not going to risk an injury finding out.  In the trash they go... I suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing
This does not fit on Super 9 rifles as far as I know.  Besides, it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny! (Most scopes are whatever zoom X30. For example, I own a 3-9X44 scope. This means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom.  The second number refers to the size of the scope lens.  I'd seriously reccomend a 3X30 if you can get one.  Also make sure it's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail.  If you are getting it for the Super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight (peephole)
I purchased this bike rack because I was moving out of state and didn't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike.  I also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails, parks, etc.  So, I went with Schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive.  I drove from NC to Fla, approx 700 miles, bad idea with this rack.  I didn't have any trouble assembling the rack, only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go.  However, during my trip, I had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back.  The buckles do NOT hold the straps in place.  This is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway (or any busy road) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic.  Also, even if the buckles hold, The wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame.  I had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back (and yes, the rack was assembled correctly).  Bottom line, this rack is probably a great value if don't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph, otherwise, it is a a complete waste.      
I bought this model a year ago, and replaced the deck after approximately 8 months.  Just recently, the deck cracked again.  Of course the warrantly no longer applies.  Save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and spend a little extra to upgrade to a better brand.

Absolutely no use to me whatsoever. Next
I am 6'1 and this jump rope was too short for me, it says that its adujustable, but it can only be made shorter and not longer.  For a kid this is a good jump rope, but its definitely not for a tall person
I ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two.  After applying one vial, it seemed even worse than before.  (Tread "catches" as I walk.)  So I applied the second vial just to make it usuable.  (Still not great.)  This stuff is overpriced and either they don't give you enough or it's poor quality

I purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine. Unfortunetly, the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical. I would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment
...for more than a couple of minutes (no matter what I did) and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink.  Overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke.  I've gotten much better results for the same money with other products
The suction cups do not work on many toilet seats. Though the idea is great, save your money unless you have some to burn
This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you.My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item. Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it.I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper)Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap. Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl. Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it.I don't think no one will die from this type of trick
I consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds.  I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big.  I think that for a "small" backpack, that they are just too large.  Thank you
I returned this item, as it didn't fit my 19-pound Boston Terrier well at all. It was way too large for his body. "Small" obviously means small for a larger dog instead. Just be aware!
I bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching TV...I wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive.

The wood is very nice - but the design/ manufacturing is very poor.My experience trying to assemble this rack was frustrating.  The holes aren't properly pre-drilled.  The hole at the top didn't match up with the cap-plate hole, which A) made it very difficult to screw together (the first screw stripped) and B) resulted in a gap and wobbly finally assembly.  I experienced the same issue with shallow pre-drilled holes in the bottom, and the bolts not going in all the way. I never got to the point of figuring out the cryptic finally assembly instructions.  Based on the wobbly central column, I decided to disassemble mine and send it back.
When I was assembling this product I discovered that not only were the instructions vague, and that the product pictured did not appropriately match the product given, but that the product itself was sloppily manufactured.  The predrilled holes were only half the depths that the instructions required them to be in order to properly assemble and adjust the final height.  My thought is... How hard is it to drill a hole to a proper depth?Luckily I own the tools necessary to fix their mistakes, but how much money are they really saving by inconveniencing their customers?I wish I could give this product a higher rating, but hopefully there are better alternatives
This pillow is too small and it is not comfortable at all
I bought these skates last year, with the plans of putting outdoor wheels on them.  When I tried to take the wheels off, they wouldn't budge!  Spend the extra $50 on a pair of quality skates that you can keep for years.  When the  *indoor* wheels on these die, the skates die too.  These most definitely are not roller derby skates, since those girls change their wheels all the time!
I bought these skates for my daughter from Sport Authority.  Since we both wear the same size, I decided I would try and skate in them after my daughter.  She complained the wheels would not roll and when I tried to loosen them with a skate tool, they wouldn't loosen at all.  I tried to skate in them as well and I almost fell on my face.  I wasn't expecting the same quality as my professional skates, but at least hoped for skates that rolled safely!
I am a HUGE ski person and I got the jump it is so small for me because I am do like 50 feet drops all the time.___________________MY SUGGESTION___________________This is good for you starting your kid out on there first scooter they got for the holidays or skate board what ever you get him and its good for those things. Not Ideal what so ever for skiing. I got it to practice low ground tricks like a 180 at least so go for it if you are doing it for your son or daughter with there first scooter or bike or skateboard NOT skiing
This may be an acceptable ramp for a child 6-8, but an older child would laugh at this one.  I was embarrassed to even give it to my son
it wasnt very good and it didnt tell how bad it wqa
There was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts. My son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road. He could not. It is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface
this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard. First of all, i thought this would be a bit larger. When i tried to go off of the ramp, my nose hit the front of it. Not only is it not fun, but you need to weigh it down if you dont want to slide around. If you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard,i recommend something else.
it should be stateed this item is for 7 years and younger very small for older kid
Not very bright for an LED.  AND, guess what? This is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes!Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack.I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this.
I got four boxes of these matches so I was motivated to learn how to use them.  I had read the directions about poking them into the lid.  I tried stroking and poking at various angles and finally got one to light after about 10 minutes.  It burned down to the wood portion and went out.  Incidentally, these matches are very short. Perhaps one is supposed to light them with a lighter
 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Why by a gun from these guys? If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back. Want a refund? You pay a 15% restocking fee. Take a pass on Airsplat. 
The title pretty much says it all.  The bag is solid and didn't get too soft even after a good amount of use.  The big downside is that the metal clasps that are used to hang up the bag are of extremely poor quality and can't support the weight of the bag. One of the clasps actually broke in two and two of the others became bent beyond usability.  All within about six months of use.  Unless you're prepared to spot weld the clasps to reinforce them I'd look elsewhere for a heavy bag. 
I was so frustrated with those so called "sticky mats", my hands would slide forward in simple poses like downward facing dog. So I decided to give the $50 skidless yoga towel a try.This worked pretty well for my slipping hands, but i had a new problem.  I was unable to get traction for my feet and felt as though they would slip up when in many of the commonly practiced poses in yoga.  (downward facing dog, even poses like triangle and extended side angle).  I really tried giving this towel a chance but ended up purchasing a harmony yoga mat (those rubber mats) which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences.I would not recommend the skidless towel for your entire mat, maybe you may have better luck with just the hand towel.I realized with yoga mats that every person is different, so what doesn't work for me, may work for you.  I just thought I would give my 2 cents
I bought the CycleOps Wind Indoor Trainer to train at home when I can't hit the road because of work (or weather) complications. If you are like me that means weekdays late at night, or very early in the morning. I'm terribly frustrated because I can't use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes. My neighbors can't stand it. Hey, I can't stand it! The noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner. To give you an idea, I don't even hear the music from my iPod while riding this thing. Don't buy it! Go for the magnetic resistance models.
Mitts no good tore up in two weeks, inside came out. very displease
seems I may have already broke this bar - twisted it to stop it from spinning while I was doing exercise and heard a POP now it spins all the time I use it - Not happy :(  I did not force it a suprised such a sturdy looking piece would break already
For $20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking/jogging, with a bonus pedometer.  The radio has no channel display, and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial, then a scan button.  When walking, it loses the station occasionally - luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial, but if yours isn't this could be terribly annoying.  As for the pedometer, it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband, and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when I was holding it perfectly still - thus worthless.  I'm sending it back
I'm a big fan of Topeak's gear. I own two of their racks, couple of pumps, bags, etc. I use the MTX trunk bag/panniers to commute, and I live in Florida so I needed rain cover. I purchased this, and to my surprise----Topeak failed to include a strap for a rear blinkie. Yes, the cover is yellow. Yes, there's a reflective triangle. But that's not the same as a blinkie. Gee, Topeak, do you think people might want to run a blinkie in the rain? Stupid lack of planning.
After only one or two uses, the heads of the clubs began breaking off from the shafts, rending themselves completely useless. I'm very disappointed as I have another set of Cougar clubs that has performed well for the past 2 years. I would not recommend buying this set of clubs
I bought this set after reading the positive reviews but I must say that I am terribly disappointed. Two of iron broke (yes, broke!) while I was practicing in the range. Its completely worthless and I strongly suggest to stay away from this set
This software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit.  I am sending the gps i just purchased, along with this software, back to amazon.  The software will not communicate with the gps, and the company will not respond to any of my support requests, the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available, and the live technical support is a complete joke.  After 20 minutes of being on hold, I spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english, and offered me no help... I knew more about the software than him, and i've only owned it 3 days.  I'll never purchase from Magellan again
Did not fit into the handle bar on my recently purchased bike. It should have listed the minimum inside diameter of the handle bars it would accommodate
Overall poor quality in craftsmanship. One can clearly see the glue that holds the gold trim in place, and on mine the trim on the handles was loose and could be easily removed. The wood is of subpar quality as well. The price is low; however, I would not recommend these swords
Please don't waste your hard earned money on this awful toy. It is tiny! The "hinges" and lock had worn marks on the plastic even before opening the product so you know they will break off soon. The "jewels" never sink, either.Interestingly, PoolToy doesn't list the size of this product. In fact they don't give much information at all which is very misleading and disappointing. What a rip off. I hope Amazon discontinues its association with this company. Look at the feedback record for them. It's as terrible as this toy is
If you order this sword, you may not get what you see. Yes you will get the same 'style' of sword, but as for the look, forget it, the steel is pure black. Now if that's what you want great, I personally wanted the 'silver' steel look, but got the 'jet black' steel. Don't worry, it was the same sword, just a different color.
Hi,I am highly regretting buying this mat.It is too bulky to carry.And it came on sale in Big 5 for half the price of Amazon
Expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order. Tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail.  Refused package a month ago.  Exorbitant charge made to my credit card and I will have to seek resolution with them, since Amazon takes no responsibility.  Vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel/refund order.AMAZON PLACES ORDERS WITH SKETCHY VENDORS LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU'RE STUCK WITH ERRONEOUS CHARGES.  BEWARE!!
Amazon has the brand mislabeled as Apex, but it is Ipex. Cardboard box arrived spilt open and plastic carrying case was cracked--obviously it was never intended to hold so much weight. The rubber handles are very hard and already coming apart. The "chrome" paint is already peeling before even one use. Also, buyers should be aware that you can only increase the weight in 5lb increments, and if you plan on using both dumbbells at the same time, the maximum weight on each is 15lbs (If i would have thought about it, when I purchased it I would have realized both of these). Overall very poor quality. I will try to return
We bought this for my 7yr old son, and in 2 days he had totally destroyed it. Thank goodness we had it on a tile floor. He kicked the bottom and it broke letting out all the water! What a mess. Not worth the money
The idea is great for my son who studies karate, but the quality of the product is below sub par.  The pump broke two pumps into blowing the thing up.  I spent the better part of the night hallucinating while blowing up this thing.  Everyday it had to be blown up again WITHOUT THE PUMP!  I told my son it was garbage and said he could practice on his big sister.  DON'T cheap out with this
Although they claim that this item can be used by adults, it is the furthest thing from the truth.  You can only fill the black bottom HALF up with water, which you wouldn't know until you buy it.  Due to this, you can't do any combonations with this bag as you knock on its' side with even the most mild of punches. Also, after a few hits, it rips open like your fists were made of nails even with gloves on.  The only reason why this purchase was made was due to the fact that I have no where to hang my actual heavybag in my apartment. This is not even remotely a replacment for a real bag.  Save your twenty five dollars for something else
i cant fit a normal mattress in my new apt so i need this till i move i had it a month and the one of the seams tore and kept getting bigger i couldnt patch it because the hole was on the velour side so i had to buy a new one. im not buyin a swiss air mattress agai
I bought this for our camping trip to the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee.  The valve on this matress has a little flap on the inside that is supposed to stop air from coming out while you're securing the screw-on valve.  Unfortunatly, the design of the pump is such that you have a plastic nozzle that pushes the flap back to far to shut properly.What this means is that you pump it up nice and firm, but the flap does not properly prevent air from escaping while you secure the valve cover. So you end up with not nearly as firm a matress as you would otherwise have.  I will say that the mattress did stay at the the less than firm inflation point while we slept on it overnight, and the pump was robust and quick. However, the valve flap problem is serious enough that I am returning the product
Works as advertised, except...  One of the attachment straps broke the 3rd day.  No particular stress applied or anything.  I'm going to Allen to see if I can get a replacement.  That was my only complaint.  Otherwise, it's fine.  Then again, breaking on the 3rd use is a big complaint
     The frame seems to be the only thing of any quality on this bike.  I have owned this for three months so far and have had to replace the shifter, derailer, brakes and other small items.  This bike is NOT Schwinn's usual quality.  Very disapointin
If you just like the cruiser look and will use the bike only occasionally for very short rides (less than 10 miles) then this is probably not a bad bike. BUT, if you want a much more comfortable and efficient bike, and one that will fit your body properly, go to your local bike shop and ask to see their "hybrid" bikes. This type of bike gets its name from being a cross between a "road bike" and a "mountain bike" or "all terrain" bike. They are available in several frame sizes, so you're not stuck with "one-size-fits-all", which is NOT good if you are shorter than about 5'7 or taller than about 5'10. Hybrids are available in a wide range of prices and equipment selections. The price will range from just over $200 to as high as you want to go (over $1500 anyway). As the price goes up, the weight generally goes down and the quality of the frame and all components goes way up. But even at the low end of the scale, a hybrid will be a much more efficient bike to ride (more miles covered per energy expended) and it will be more comfortable on longer rides (over 10 miles). If you are truly interested in covering some longer distances (up to maybe 30-40 miles) focus on the models that feature 700C wheels as opposed to 26-inch--your bike shop person can explain--and keep the tire width down to 35mm or under (28mm is a good size for most people if they ride only on pavement). The narrower tires offer less "rolling resistance" making the bike easier to pedal and the larger wheel sizes improves efficiency a little also.Happy peddaling,A VERY experienced cyclis
i ordered the item saying it was in-stock. but days passed i still havent received the item until i followed it up. i was told the item was in a back order. i think they shouldnt write in-stock if the item is really a back order meaning they dont have it. it delayed the item for 2-3weeks and it was suppose to be a gift.though i can say the item was nice when i got it
This compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers.  The pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break.  The card (actual compass part that spins) wobbles a lot so it's difficult to get an exact bearing.  It is like the oil in the compass is very thin.  Also, the direction line lid spins easily, making it possible to take a bad reading.  Ironically, this is the Silva weakness as well.If you need an inexpensive engineer style compass, consider the Silva.  For a two more dollars, you get an aluminum case, a hinge that won't break and a card that doesn't wobble with the slightest hand movement
I was tired of the rental skates and wanted to be able to zip around the floor with my kids at the skating rink.  So I bought these skates.  At the time, it felt a little impulsive to spend so much on skates.  Well, now I know I should have spent more and at least be happy with what I purchased.I had such a hard time skating with these skates, and when I talked to the guy at the pro shop and 2 people online (there are a lot of resources online-do a search for quad skates) I realized these skates were made for beginning kids, never a 36 year old mom!  They are not made to do the kind of things on the floor you think you might be able to do.  In fact, I couldn't even turn.  I kept having to push off because they would slow down.  I kept adjusting them and had a professional at the rink adjust them for me, and forget it!  I'm selling them at the resale shop and spending more money to at least get something decent
This cargo carrier is so flimsy that I thought it would fall apart before I got to my destination.  The hinges are a joke and barely work.  It is also a nightmare to assemble
I think they are too stiff for comfort.  I do like the short finger, but the material over the back of the hand is too stiff. I thought it would stretch out and soften a bit. But it hasn't.  Protects the hands well through off road trails though.
 OK so i got this gun for christmas and i open it and i'm so excited. Then i play with it, its working then i go to charge it boom. 8 hours later its dead the gun will not work. I checked the battery it has full juice. I had my dad and uncles look and try to fix this for about 2 hours they could not figure it out. Currently my uncle is going to take the gun apart and try to fix it. DO NOT BUY THIS GUN OR ANY OTHER TOYS OR AIRSOFT GUNS FROM THIS COMPANY! PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS IT IS A RIP OF AND THE COMPANY HAS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER REVIEWS! That is my review and i am a kid and im doing this on my moms nam
This gun was okay when I first started using it. It's really a backyard gun, and should only be used for beginners. I had it on my bed, which is about two feet high, and it fell when my dog jumped on, the barrel broke. The spring in the magazine also broke. There are better guns out there, but if you just want to have some good clean fun in your backyard, this is the gun for you. The sight is a pretty nice feature.
I was very disappointed with this purchase, since I have always been an Under Armour supporter. These gloves felt like I was wearing a material that sped up the onset of frost bite to my hands! Definitely not for cold weather, don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let me first say that I did not purchase this mini stepper through Amazon, but rather directly from the Discovery Channel Store. Two weeks after I submitted my review of their product on their web site, however, they still have not seen fit to post it.I used the Discovery Electronic Mini Stepper daily for 29 days (30 minutes per day) before the cable around the pulley-wheel broke. This seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment, judging by previous reviews on the DCS (Discover Channel Store) web site. Being inside the 30 day return window, I sent my stepper back for a refund. Customer service, I must say, was excellent...only the product itself was cheap and substandard.On a related note, this is the third mini stepper (various brands, not all DCS) I have owned in the past year. They have all broken down in one way or another. Feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details, but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper.Take some advice from me when I say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness. That is to say, if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15-20 minutes, then you may be satisfied with one. However, if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine, then don't even consider one of these machines - you will destroy it, trust me. There's just too much that can go wrong -- pulleys cracking, pulley cables breaking, shocks leaking...and I actually broke the frame of one stepper. Through all of this, I have learned one important lesson about exercise: keep it simple. I am now having great success with some simple resistance bands (many varieties are available here at Amazon) and cardiovascular exercises (e.g. regular old jumping-jacks). I get a better workout than any I ever got from a mini stepper, and I'm feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places :-)Honestly, if you want to save yourself some grief, please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction. Just buy yourself some resistance bands, maybe a jump rope, an exercise mat, an instructional video/book, and then get to work. Exercising to tone your body and lose weight isn't easy (and if it is, then you're probably not doing it right), but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this
For all of the supposed 'resistance' built into this machine, it enables you to do  many -more- repetitions than you'd be able to do  of simple bodyweight 'core' exercises,(crunches, leg lifts, situps, and a multitude of others). Why is that, and what is the effect? 1/ Why : The resistance is -less- than the resistance supplied by the weight of your own body being moved around without any equipment. The so-called 'resistance' actually -assists- you on the return motion, the exact opposite of exercise.2/The Effect: You must do an incredibly high number of repetitions do get any effect at all, and it won't be much even then. High rep work should be full-body cardio , not isolated ab work. Ab work should be the same as any other muscle-building work : After you can do 15 reps , the resistance should be raised: Exercising the abs, obliques, other core muscles  to strengthen and build them. If an exercise doesn't get difficult enough to make you stop after a minute or so, it simply isn't difficult enough to do you any good. There is no such thing as spot reducing exercise. Modern ads know better than to claim the lie of spot-reduction, but they still strongly imply it. Why do they get away with it? : Because people never stop looking for an easy way out. The re-sale value of these gizmos goes down to around 5 bucks as soon as you own it. Why? : Because the market is flooded with as-seen-on-tv, home-exercise junk that's collecting dust
I bought this based on the other review.  It takes forever to inflate and when it does the seal where it does must be very poor.  All through the night it leaks air and becomes quite soft.  I am waking up during the night reinflating this thing and after an hour it is back to being deflated.  Don't waste your money like I did
The Brunton Nexus Star is a low-cost, fairly rugged, basic compass.  Like any low-cost compass, if you know how to use it you can get where you want to go, but it lacks features you may later wish you had.  On the plus side, it is lightweight, inexpensive, and fairly thin, so it doesn't take up a lot of room in your pocket.  On the minus side, the baseplate is very short, so it is harder to use with a map and a little less accurate when reading a bearing.  The biggest disadvantage, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have a true declination adjustment; it is advertised as having a "declination scale" which is not the same.  On a baseplate compass, you take a bearing by lining up the compass needle inside the North Reference Indicator (sometimes called the "Doghouse") etched on the bottom of the vial.  Compasses with true declination adjustment allow you to rotate this "Doghouse" to align it with the desired declination.  That way you always read a bearing by aligning the needle inside the Doghouse.  On the Nexus Star, however, you can't do this.  Instead, you have to remember to line up the compass needle with the point on the scale that corresponds to the local declination.  In this case, the needle is not boxed inside the doghouse, and I find it can lead to errors, especially when you are tired and not thinking clearly after a long hike.  If you always navigate using magnetic bearings rather than true bearings, this isn't a problem.I can recommend this compass for use with a GPS receiver that is set to read magnetic bearings, and it is suitable as a back-up compass.  I also regularly use it as an inexpensive tool to teach students in my GPS classes how to use a compass, but I wouldn't recommend it for serious work
I threw this away yesterday (3.30.7) First of all, it's too cheaply designed and manufactured to stop anything as heavy as a door. The tin plate on it fell off last week and no one even broke into my home. I went to my local hardware store and purchased a solid steel 'Collins Axe #4 (wood) Splitting Wedge' to replace it. I bought a tube of Hard As Nail Heavy Duty contruction Adhesive and affixed some rubber to one side of the wedge to prevent slippage. Now that's the way a door wedge should be! Don't waste your money on this cheap Chinese garbage called the 'Super Door Stop Alarm'! Make your own right here in the USA
they dont even go where u want them to they suc and i dont recomend buying the
This ball is radio controlled with a remote that is about the size of a small cell phone. The ball has two small holes (smaller than the size of a dimple) on opposite sides that connect to a battery operated charger (2 AA). The remote uses a 9V battery. The ball has a small internal battery that apparently can be replaced if needed once it can longer hold a charge. The ball can be operated for a couple of minutes after a charge. The ball is not meant to be hit, but probably can withstand a putter hit from a short distance. Because of a rolling weight and circuitry within the otherwise hollow ball, the ball does not roll straight on its own. The ball looks somewhat like a real ball but has a slightly off-white color and has an obvious seam. When using the remote to control the ball, the ball revs up for 2-3 seconds by making a rattling sound, then it takes off still rattling away. An arrow on the ball is present to let you know the initial direction the ball will roll. You can reverse the ball's direction, but you can't make it go left or right.The two biggest drawbacks of this gag ball are:1. You can only direct the ball in two directions (front - back) with the remote.2. A fairly loud rattling noise is made by the ball that probably can be heard from about 20 yards away.As a gag ball, it seems like it is of only limited use. But for about $10, what more can I expect
The 'blue' body ball that was sent to me was not blue. It's white with some blue print. The pump didn't work right so I used a rocket type pump that came with a ball I had purchased from another company. Plugs and pumps seem to be interchangeable. The quality of the 'blue' ball is good. When I opened the box it looked like the ball was the wrong size but it expands to the 65cm. My first thought was wrong color, wrong size. No inflation directions enclosed in box only an excercise chart. Ball is OK, pump is not. I was not happy but didn't want the return hassle. If you aren't fussy about color and have a back-up pump, go for it.
My Daughter is 38" and about 30lbs.  It's the perfect size for her.  We mainly use it as something to lay on while watching TV or reading books on the floor. PROS- When in the "chair position", it's tall enough to accommodate taller children.- Cover is removeable and washable- Comes with handy pink storage bag (although it's kinda hard to fit the pump in the bag along with the bed)- Pretty easy to convert into chair (there are 2 straps on each side of the bed that need to be "connected" in order to change it into chair - they are color coded).  Might be hard for young children to figure out how to do it.- Inside of sleep bag is made of soft material (although it appears as though it may snag easily).- Large zipper located on one side of the sleep bag.  Easy for small hands to use.- Weight limit: 100 lbsCONS- The Pump is VERY cheaply made and it takes a long time to inflate the bed (it operates by use of foot motion or you can use your hands).- The air slowly leaks out of the bed.  We actually thought ours had a hole in it when purchased, so we exchanged for another one.  But this one too deflates pretty quickly.  Example: if we completely inflate at 7pm, by 8am the next morning it needs to be inflated again because it loses about 40% of it's air.- Adult help is needed to change into chair.- Adult help is needed to inflate.OVERALL: It's a bit pricey for the quality I was expecting.  It would be nice if adult assistance wasn't needed to change from bed to chair and back.  Defitely would work as an extra sleeping spot for the night, but it takes along time to inflate and requires an adult to do so
Bought it 2 months ago for in-door usage, thought it'd last until the end of the semester.After less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage, punctures started to appear, and the patches that came along with the package didn't help much.Even though the design and the built-in manual pump is a big plus, the quality is very disappointing
Just like once in a while even a blind squirrel finds a chestnut.....once in a while Amazon gets it right!  Had a very bad experience before Christmas when ordering a gift for my daughter.  After being scared into spending extra on next day shipping 2 weeks prior to Christmas....on an "IN STOCK" item,  5 days prior to Christmas, I was notified that item was OUT OF STOCK and I wouldn't receive it...PANIC MODE!  I sent an unsolicited E-Mail complaint to Amazon.  My response was pretty much  sorry, but Amazon has no control over items that they essentially broker, and don't actually inventory.....WHAT!      I noticed that they didn't ask for a review of my experience on that one!!   But my son did get his B-Ball this time....and if it wasn't for him, I would have never done business with Amazon again! This review probably doesn't meet the guidelines and undoubtedly won't be posted
 I just read an article at the Fox sports website saying it is almost certain that NBA will go back to using leather ball. There will not even be a bragging right once this officially happens, so in my opinion, don't buy it
Ok, i REALLY thought this ball would be GREAT considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the NBA.  NOT SO!  This ball feels very similar to the cheap $20 balls you can get at your local department stores!    Feels similar to the Wilson NCAA solution game ball, but slightly less tacky, but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber.  I personally do not like that.  This ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box, without a break in period.  Well, i hope it gets to feeling better over time, but since it supposedly has not break in period, i am very skeptical.  I honestly do not feel the "crosstraxxion" design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball.  If you like the feel of leather, this is NOT for you.  I am NOT impressed!  Search for reviews for this ball before purchasing!  The only thing you can do with this ball that you can't do with others, is say "Well at least this is the Official Game Ball the pros use!" 
This tablecloth bleeds. As soon as it got wet we all ended up with red checked arms! I ordered a dozen from oriental trader for the same price and they are perfect! Go figure! Avoid these
...and bike was stolen less than one month after delivery. I have HALF the cable now.Good price and attractive product for a LOW security environment
This bokken is only for looks and not hitting ant thing I used it for less than five mintues and broke. It has a nice look and feels good but does have blemishesand. Also say if you accidentally hit something even a little hard it breaks. The company does a lousey job of wrapping the sword too. The barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and I ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken. I spar with my friends all the time and would have to recommend the bokkens from karate depot instead of this inadequate piece of whatsit. Anyone,honestly, that tells you differently is wrong
I am in the same boat...stupid..I should have read the comments before bidding on ebay and getting ripped off first on price..I paid about $45 on ebay...and then it came stright from Amazon and NO DVD...I called cust service and all they could tell me is to send it back and get a refund...what a pain...I told them to use photo shop and crop out the picture of the dvd...false advertising...oh well live and learn...ball does seem pretty small once I aired it up...I think I will look else where for a differnt name brand ball.  And yes it takes like 30 min of pumping to get it blowed up and its a huge work out..arms hurt etc
I was also disappointed that the product came without a DVD, though the initial description said so. But Amazon has given me the refund of the whole purchase price. Appreciate their gesture. Agree with previous reviewer that the pump is really hard to work with. It took a *lot* of time to get the ball inflated and the pump got hot meanwhile.Yeah, not very happy with this product.p.s: Contrastingly, had a bad experience with Dell on a similar situation when I bought a Nikon camera. Dell blamed the wrong description on Nikon and expectedly, Nikon blamed Dell. Neither owned up the error. But Amazon was pretty good. I really appreciate it
...intentional rip off?There is no 50 minute work out DVD included. The pump included does not work (after pumping air for 20 minutes straight doesn't even put a dent on the deflated ball) and becomes very hot after a while. I kept thinking the plastic pump is going to melt before the ball enflates (if ever). The "65cm" ball turns out to be only "55cm."I don't know... seems like a rip off to me, but amazon is not at fault, since the Nautlius web site has the exact same description for the item.Quality-wise, the TKO Cory Everson Fitness Ball 55cm I got a while back was so much better. The plastic isn't so sticky, and it felt a lot more durable than the Nautlius one, too
My son has had this pogo stick for about a year and has not been able to play on it because the spring is too stiff and does not compress easily.  Even my daughter who weighs 70 lbs cannot get it to work.  Our 11 year old neighbour who has her own pogo stick had no problems, but it is not for the beginner
I just received this toy today in the mail and it was a total bust.  I gave it to my 14 month old daughter and she handed it back to me.  They legs that are supposed to make the music are hard to push and she can not do it herself.  I only paid 5.29 for it with free shipping so I can't complain.  At least My 3 month old likes to look at it.  I would not recommend buying this toy
Terrible as a musical toy.  My daughter liked the colors, but that was pretty much it.  It is difficult to squeeze the feet too.  Cute as a stuffed animal
Very disappointed... It didnt play any music its own  quiet difficult to squeeze.....
If you expect this to play music by itself, you will be dissapointed.  Basically, each foot is a sqeeze horn.  It's not bad a plush but as a musical toy, it's horrible
This poker set is the cheapest quality there is.  For the price, I kind of expected a lesser quality product but not this bad!  The chips are plastic with a metal insert.  The chip edge is sharp and there are a lot of imperfections on the chip like dirt was mixed in it.  Furthermore, the thickness of the chips are UNEVEN.  Therefore, when you stack the chips (depending on the color), 5 white chips may be shorter than 5 black chips.  The poker case handle broke the first time I lifted it.  The chip dividers are loose and the felt material is not glued in properly.  This is really a bad product which should be banned from Amazon.  Save yourself some grief.  Spend a little more money and buy a reputable poker set!  What a waste of time and money
I bought this bike thinking since Jeep put its name on it then it should be a great, tough, rock solid ride! Boy was I wrong! Not only the bike feels cheap and extremely heavy, its mechanics are worst part. After taking it to a bike shop to get it tuned professionally, 10 of its gears still don't work. Now you may say well the mechanic did a quick crappy job, let me tell ya, I stood by the guy as he worked on it for 2 hours yet the gears still didn't work. Overall, I'd have to give this bike two thumbs down. You're better off buying a bike from walmart
Indeed, these are way too short for protecting your knuckles. My boxing coach laughed when he saw them. Ringside make really good, long wraps which are better. --J
These are indeed the short, static hand wraps. You don't want static wraps, period. They're also too short
This is my first review. I just felt the need to tell people about this product. These things do NOT have any resistance. I think my 11 year old niece and do about 100 reps. I'll give it one star for comfort, but that's about it. I'm not even going to return them since shipping will eat half my cost away. Buy something else..
I thought this would be the ultimate gym bag. The main compartment is too narrow. Your shoes will not fit side by side, you have to stack them. The pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough. The zippers are cheap and stick. It is very pretty but not very functional. My $16.00 bag works much better.
This "key hider" wouldn't fool my 18 month old! With a VERY visible seam on the bottom, it's obvious this thing opens. You can practically see the spare key through the cheap plastic! Awful, awful, awful
Field in a bag claims to be "the perfect way to get a baseball game going".  While this may be true, the number of games you can actually play with this set will be ONE (if the set even makes it through the game).First off, with these bases you must set up the field using the wooden mallet the pound a flimsy plastic stake into the ground.  With one of my sets (I bought 3 unfortunatly at the same time not knowing their reputation), the wooden mallet wasn't even glued together, it had fallen apart so I had to just use the head.  Then when I put the stakes into the ground, out of the 3 sets I had, at least 1 in each set broke while I was placing them.To actually place the bases, the set gives you a string device that helps you measure out the field.  This was handy except for the fact that it took me 10 min to untangle the mess and then when I went to second base realized the string was not long enough.  Granted, one could place 1st and 3rd and then figure out where 2nd went but the picture in the set-up shows that the string will measure the base; however, it definintely is not the right length.After placing the bases the team is now ready to play.  However, don't wear cleats with these bases.  The bottom of the base says, not recommended for use with cleats and boy were they right!  With our game we had tball children using the bases and even their little cleats  (and not all the kids had cleats) tore them to shreds.Our bases lasted about one hour before they were torn and the inside cotton coming out.  It was very unfortunate seeing as though we purchased three sets and all were done by the end of an hour.  This non-profit won't see that money again :)So unless you plan on using these bases on the grass for easy set-up, do not plan on wearing cleats, and not playing a true game of baseball/softball....you would probably be better off buying the $8 flat bases for temporary use (and they can be left outside afterward too).- Just not impressed, sorr
About average for the price, nothing particularly illuminating about this flashlight.  The wide beam is fairly faint, with a strong central spot.  This one will go out into the garage, and likely stay there.
I live in Argentina. I bought it and someone brought it to me from the usa. The watch doesn't work and I can't change it or sent it back to usa
First of all the colors of the product at amazon pictures and the real product doesen't match. What seens to be a silver watch it is realy a white one. At the beggining everything was ok, at the end of first week the light button locked (after a few hours i get it unlocked), in the second week the the battery has ended. I'm very disappointed..
I got this for my boy scout's birthday.  He really liked it and it is cute but it was a lot smaller than I thought it was.  I'm not sure if it is usable.  My son hasn't tried using this yet
goal frame is okay but net is a pile of pants and does not last five mins. cant seem to buy replacement
I bought this over the Yakima equivalent for the locking accessory. What a mistake i made. The racketing system that locks the arm down over the bike is made of plastic and doesnt work. I called Thule to complain and was told i have a faulty unit and i need to RMA it. I sent it back yesterday and hopefully that is the case. But i would steer clear if i was you
Even though this is a receiver hitch mount item, it does not use a standard hitch pin.  It is a permanent attachment to the vehicle hitch (must be bolted into the hitch - to remove, must be unbolted).This totally defeats the purpose of a receiver hitch - versatility: the ability to easily - without tools - change whatever is mounted in the hitch.Bad Thule!  Bad
I bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping, since I tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet. I was in for a big disappointment.  For the price that I paid compare to the other yoga mats, I was very disappointed.  Lesson learned, find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on-line.For those of you who sweats alot, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS MAT.   
If you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat. Seemed to fill the room with it's funk.Does not grip well. I bought it for grip.Yes, it's stable. Worth it? Not to me.Try the hugger mugger earth elements mat(5mm model). It's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat. Not as stable in place, but seems a better value(reasonable price). And it's biodegradable
I couldnt find this item ANY where but Amazon.Its all my Grandson wanted. I asked him after he had been fishing how he liked it- He said" I dont like it" I asked why, they arent cheep- He said " It doesnt soot far enough" ( OH!  Dylan is 7 yrs. old)    Hope this helps
Well, they looked so cool on TV that I ordered 2 of them and I regret it. It's awkward to get the hook back into the "rocket" once the bait is on. I took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod. We left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current. I've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money. If you're going to take a little one out fishing, just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat IDEA. [...]
 I road this bike for the first time today. I got to walk it home. The gear shifter boke off into my spokes and bent the rim. This bike is a unreliable piece of junk
My first pedometer from Sportline worked only a few days (digital display completely disappeared), so I returned it to them, and after over two months and several emails from me to them, they replaced it with this Sportline 350.  The first two days, it worked fine, although it seemed to count many more steps than it should have.  The third day, in the middle of the day it said approx. 3400 steps, later that afternoon it said 1300 steps, and by nighttime the display totally disappeared, and never came back.  I just sent the second one back, and am expecting that again it will take several weeks and multiple emails to get the situation resolved with their slow customer service.  Their products seem to be very poorly made, and I don't expect to purchase any more.... after reading the reviews, I have just purchased an Omron, and am hoping it will be much more reliable
The pedometer worked great for the first two weeks. Than my 1 1/2 year old snatched it off my jeans, it fell on the tile floor and broke the casing of it. It still worked, but I had to be careful when I opened it because the back was broken and no longer attached. Last w/e it stopped working completely. Everthing is set to 0 and won't move. My husbands odometer seems to be working fine. However, I'm dissapointed for the short life-span....M. L. McDermot
I purchased two of the same pedometer for my boyfriend and I and they both stopped working on the same day! We only had them 10 days and when they went kaput
I thought this was great at first until I realized that it works sporadically. I can get up in the morning and walk all over the house, look down and check my Sportline to find it is still registered at 0 steps. Other times I can walk a mile or more and find it recorded maybe 20 steps. One of the problems with it is its shape. Unlike some pedometers (like Omron) that are a vertical oval-shape, the Sportline is a horizontal rectangle, which makes it easily roll with the waistline of your pants or skirt. It's important for a pedometer to be perpendicular to the ground for it to record accurately. After much frustration, I finally bought an Omron pedometer which I love. Unfortunately, this Sportline model is so inconsistent and inaccurate as to be useless.
I ordered 2 of these pedometers and neither of them count steps accurately.  One only counts about half the steps I take and the other is usually 2500 steps behind that.  I wore them both for a week and got the same results everyday.  I could understand if one didn't work properly but I got 2 at the same time with the same problem.  I would not recommend this product
This light worked for me when I used two D-batteries, but that was a lucky guess as the light did not come with instructions. I was also unaware that the light was fender mount, and wasn't happy about the idea of drilling a hole in my fender just for the light. I found that replacing the front  reflector with the light worked OK for me, and this replacement was easy on the cruiser I have. My main complaint for this product is the lack of description on the internet, and the missing installation instructions
I ordered two of these with high hopes, to be utterly disappointed.First the design of the battery holders is bad. They are supposed to hold two C cell batteries. When I tried to get one in, I initially concluded that a different size must be requried, as it seemed the C size wouldn't fit. After much futzing around, I managed to get two C cells in without hopelessly bending the flimsy contact springs. This one now works but I doubt that I could successfully remove and replace the batteries again. The battery holder is too flimsy. On the second unit the contact wire which connects the two far ends of the batteries had fallen out of its plastic holder. After 15 minutes of trying to put it back I gave up. This unit is totally unusable. Nothing on the Pyramid package label indicates that two batteries, C cell size, are needed but not included.Second this is a fender mount light, meaning if you want to mount it to your handlebar there's no way to do that with the hardware included. While the Pyramid box does say "Fender Mount," that description was not included in the online product description. And, this light with batteries installed is fairly heavy. The lightweight plastic fender on my front bike tire would not come close to supporting this light, and I doubt that many bike fenders these days would. Why would anyone sell this as a bike headlight without including a handlebar mount??I'm totally disgusted with this flimsy product, and with the vendor who sold it to me
When i bought the resistance bands i thought they were going to be much bigger than i thought. i havent used them since i bought them...i sent in a questionairre sort-of-deal back to the company i bought them from requesting an exchange, but i havent heard a thing from them. i'm not very pleased.
The scooter came with broken brakes. After numerous phone calls to Razor, they sent the wrong part. They dont answer their phones during their open hours and the customer service is a slap in the face. Buy another brand!
This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler. 1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy 2. Door Stop 3. Play Street Hockey 4. Stress Release Stomping Toy 5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift 6. Modern Art for Coffee Table 7. Nerf Ball Target Practice 8. Condom Dispenser Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun! PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at: Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it.
I bought this watch because I wanted an altimeter but needed to return it because of its size. It is HUGE - looked like I had a clock on my wrist. Take into consideration
Two Amazon's statements about this product were absolutely misleading:1. "Usually ships in 24 hours". It actually took 1 week to ship it.2. When I finally received the package it turned out that the watch didn't have "leather band". The band was made of artificial materials (nylon and rubber) or something like that.I will have to return it
i don't really write reviews, but i felt like i needed to say something about this one. maybe its me, but i couldn't get the pump to work. So i bought a new basketball. I bought a regular one, and bought a pump. I wish that infusion thing worked out, because it would have been great to deflate it, put it in my bag, and then pump it up again at the court. But my friend warned me they don't work so good. I'm just stubborn i guess. That's my 2 cents. Take it for what its worth
We've gone through about 2 or 3 generations of infusion basketballs from spalding.  The gimmick isn't worth it and there are better balls like the original zi/o and the excel for outdoor and the TF1000 for indoor
I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.
I was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good.  When it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2-4 people.   I kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch.  The Pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox
This nightmare was so disappointing! It was hard to assemble, and the instructions were minimal and illegible. It is an overpriced piece of junk. In addition, the net for the hoop was not in the box, and the hoop was put on backwards. My son was so upset. I would think this company would be able to produce a product that would be functional, with proper communication, and some info how to contact them if there was a problem, because there will definitely be a problem!
just got it today and i am kinda mad there is a small leak near the top so i have to keep it upright or the bag gets soaked. the pack itself though is very nice, many pocekts for keys, cell phone, ipod, ect
Small...very small kit, not as advertised.  Every item needs expensive batteries 
Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product
The plug that keeps the air in kept popping out.  We took it back and bought another one.  Same problem.  So we took it back again.  I think we spent more on gas going back and forth than we did on the float.  Buy one of better quality
We recieved two of these for my daughter's first birthday. She LOVES being in the pool but this float ALMOST changed EVERYTHING!!!!The inner tube sinks underneath the top tube no matter how you try and fix it or blow it up. My daughter FREAKED OUT!!!! She had never been afraid of the water until we put her in this.DO NOT waste your money
When I purchased this item I got the impression that the kit (looking at the picture) included everything but the gazebo - which is the frame.You should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit. I need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it. The title of this item should say: "gazebo screen" and not "gazebo screen KIT"... Unhappy custome
We bought this tractor from Joe Brands.  It was a big disappointment!  It was very poor quality and did not function at all as was described on the Joe Brands site.  When I contacted Joe Brands and explained all the problems with this tractor they would not refund my money 100%.  They refused to pay the return shipping to send their dysfunctional item back to them.  They told me I had to pay the shipping and send it back to the manufacturer in Wisconsin instead of back to Joe Brands in Colorado.  I am in Las Vegas and it cost me a lot for shipping to Wisconsin instead of Colorado.  When I bought this item they sent it to me with free shipping.  After I shipped it back to them and they received it they disallowed my initial "free shipping" and deducted the original shipping cost from my refund.  I am out over $100 because of Joe Brands.  IF YOU BUY FROM JOE BRANDS YOU MAY BE SORRY!
I bought the armor abs because my gym membership just ended at my college.  So I wanted to get a few small workout machines for home.  The day i got it, one of the rubber bands popped of its holder already.  The machine is designed very poorly, although what can you expect for the price.  I've had to reattach the bands at least 15 times over the past week, and today one of the rubber band holders snapped in half, leaveing that resistance level useless :-( .  Overall though, i have to say, i really love this thing.  If it wasnt for the d*mn bands flyin off all the time, it would be a great peice of equipment.  If you use it carefully and correctly, you may be able to avoid these problems though.  I give it a two because i love the machine, but i hate its bad habits...
the very day i received the armor abs 2, i used it, and all the bands came loose that same day. i see why it is so much cheaper than the 6 second ab
this is the worst piece of junk i have ever purchased, i cant believe it, please dont waste your time or money on this, it b    roke the second day, rubber bands poped man what a piece of junk  i rate it a fat zero but i only had an option to give it a one
Not well made at all and only works half the time; and the programming changes on its own.   I recommend spending a little more for a better piece.  Don't waste money on this one
Not like the picture at all and very cheap looking and didnt form to the head correctly. Must have been stuck in the box too long!....husband said...send it back! Needless to say, we got a refund
Does not work like advertised.  Ball falls way to low and right next to the pole way before you can hit it again.  It may also damage a wood or aluminum bat.  Last time I buy anything before reading the reviews on amazon.
I bought this for my 10 year old son's birthday.  He was very excited about it and having Derek Jeter endorse it was an added treat for him.  We spent half an hour setting it up and trying to figure out how to use it.  We eventually concluded that it was a BIG disappointment.  The ball comes around real slow and drops to the bottom of the pole.  I was worried he was going to hit the pole instead of the ball.  I can imagine how this might work for a power hitter like Jeter, but imagine a 10 year old!  Save your money, time, and child's feelings
This is the first product I've bought through Amazon that I wish I could give a negative star rating.  After involving three adults and spending about 3 hours troubleshooting, I've concluded this product **** DOES NOT *** work.  Customer service cites this is a "product upgrade".  A video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit.  What we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle.  It would barely even unwrap.  Imagine Derek Jeter in the photo trying to hit the ball three inches from the pole at 1.5 miles per hour and you can begin to understand this product upgrade. 
This looks better on TV than it actually works.  The cable that the ball is connected to is very rigid and you have to really hit the ball hard to get it to wrap around.  When it unwinds it does so VERY slow and loses it's momentum and sinks to the pole before you even get a chance to hit it.  Plus they advise you not to use an aluminum or wood bat to hit it with?  What are you supposed to hit it with then?  These things you don't find out until you get it out of the box and set it up.  Don't waste money on this item
This bike should not have the name Mountain in it, you can not take this bike off ride.  It might be good for paved roads but you will hurt yourself if you try to use this bike even on the most basic of trails.Do not buy this bike
I had purchased a rifle from Airslat and it broke after 3 minutes of use.  The quality was not good, but, the customer service of this company is the worst i have ever dealt with.  It has been 2 weeks and no replacement has been shipped.  i have had every excuse imaginable, first they wanted me to pay for shipping, then they wanted me to pay full price for another gun, then they said they did not have that model any longer and I would have to pay for the higher priced model.  i still have not been refunded or had the item replaced.  i have spent hours trying to get this taken care of with no progress.  the worst customer service of all time!
i would not reccommend this product.  i would rather do chinese arithmetic than put this together again.  it took a long time and i am good at this type of thing.  the unit is ok but not as good as it looks.  hope this was helpfu
I used this product for surface level snorkeling and was extremely disappointed: 1) it filled up with water after only 15 minutes in the water and 2) the plastic holder came off of the clasp during snorkeling (luckly, I noticed it floating near me when I stoped to clear my mask).  Referring to this product as 'waterproof' is criminal as everything I placed in the holder was saturated with water; even after dumping it out and resealing throughout the day it continued to fill up with water.  In addition, this product is overpriced as a snorkeling mate found a truly waterproof holder at a dollar store that kept his contents perfectly dry throughout the day. 
Purchased the 418 Elliptical 5 months ago now.  Reviews after a week or two may not tell the whole story.  After 3 weeks the clicks, squeaks and clunks wouldn't go away by just tighting bolts so I called for service.  It took 4 weeks to get a tech. to look at it, he had to order parts which took another 4 weeks.  Replaced one of the main flywheels inside and the track rollers under the pedals.  It's not as noisy now but still makes a clicking noise on every rotation and intermittent squeaks and clunks.  Thought by spending a little more on this machine than the cheaper competition these problems would have been avoided, not so.The heat rate monitor is not accurate but the rest of the electronic features have been working fine, unlike many other reviewer's comments
This tent is alright. Its not very sturdy and they sent me the wrong parts. I bought it in the spring and this fall, with a little bit of wind its in pieces and in the garbage. I don't really think its worth the money. It is very spacious, just wish it was better made.
I was surprised when I received what appeared to be a sales brochure. I searched carefully through the shipping materials to see if I had missed the book entirely, but in fact the small, clumsily put together manual was in fact the $3.75 book that I bought online. It has some new exercises in it, but most of what we needed to know came with the therabands in the little manual that ships with them.
i dont have this ramp but my neighbor does. i have a homemade quaterpipe that is 4 feet in height and is about the same price in materials. the lauch ramp is really small and after awhile it gets pretty boring. im a skateboarder and usually go 2 da sk8prk which i find more fun then playing on a small lauch ramp. i dont think this ramp is worth the price at all. u can get ramp plans on websites for free and u can build a much better ramp for a cheeper price
This ramp set is really fun to skate on, but keep in mind that it takes a lot of damage. First it will begin to slide when you skate on it due to lost rubber bottoms. Screwing screws into the edges of the ramp can somewhat solve this problem. The worst thing that happens is when the front of the ramp begins to curl upward, making it so you have to constantly pull it back down. I forgot to do this one time and my skateboard wheels locked up and I went flying. But don't let this turn you away. It is a good fly box nonetheless, but just keep in mind that a homemade wooden one would last you a lifetime, not a year.
Have received and reviewed this item. I cranked it for 2 minutes. The radio played no longer than 2-3 minutes then died. I tried to crank it longer - same results. It is useless. It's large and bulky (though very sleek and nice). The cranking handle looks fragile and I suspect with all the cranking this toy needs, it will break sooner than later. Bottom line: Don't buy it. I own another similar product which has a simple look however the radio plays for at least one hour on a 1 - 2 minutes crank
This radio has a very good rich sound for such a small speaker.  The 1 bulb LED flashlight is brighter than I thought it would be.  The rubberized case is solid and durable.  Two minutes of cranking has consistently provided 45 minutes of play time at average volume.  There are 3 big drawbacks.  1. The tuning knob is very small and next to impossible to read.  2. The crank handle is the smallest I've seen and feels like it will break easily.  3. The worst feature is the on/off switch for the flashlight. It is a "push" round button mounted on the side that keeps turning itself on when you hold the radio or pick it up.  They should have used a "slide" switch and put it in a different area
We registered for two of these mobiles for our twins.  We recieved both of them.  Upon putting them together, we realized that the mobile can't operate without the pieces hitting the bar that holds it to the crib!  How annoying!  We returned them both
I received this trike with 3 flat tires. The 12 inch tire tube needed to be replaced. The valve in the other two tires were defective and had to be replaced
The quality of the construction was poor.  I would not recomend this to anyone.
I just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap. But there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate. What is it for, I can twist without it. Anyway, 10 mins after using the machine I got a severe knee injury. I didnt have an injury before using it but I got one now. I am going to have to get rid of it.
it was the best price around and when it finally showed up at my door i couldn't wait to put it together until it was harder than it looked. you should use more than one person to put it together maybe it was my fault but the net was not fast nor easy to set up, just like the box says it was a challenge. Extremely! I would not recommend this product for someone who has no time nor patience for an hour long set up process. I do recommend anything that folds up quick and pops up into position. But the extreme deal would be an actual 10x10x10 cage you could get online for less than 500$. You might have to spend the money but to not have to deal with the headaches over and over again putting this together is well worth it. find your self an area out side and build your real cage and enjoy it all year long. The nets are not worth the time nor the money, balls still fly up out of the net, you have to be really close and the fabric is just like a tent. with as much force as im hitting the balls with it wont be long till the material is damaged. Dont waste your money even if you do get it for 60 bucks. The wind will always win, once it catches sail it tumbles like sage grass. Get Bigger Better Deals with the real Cage
I received the net missing a pole which you obviously need to erect the net properly.  But I was particularly disappointed in the net and its ability to stop a golf ball.  It no more stopped a driven golf ball than drapped toilet paper! Unless you hit the nylon target, you have lost a ball!  I may as well hang the nylon target alone from a tree and the results will be the same if I miss the target
I received my Cage Net on August 12 06 I set it up on Aug.16.I hit about 50 golf balls into it and one of the tabs that holds the black tarp tore loose.I then noticed that there was a hole in the netting.Where is the QUALITY
I got this net and set it up in February and been using it fairly regularly. I was hitting some balls tonight and noticed some tears in the netting much to my disappointment! Shouldn't a $100.00 golf net last longer than 3-4 months?Completely unacceptable
While I like the functions this offers, the screen is a bit hard to read when riding.  Also, the instructions aren't very easy to follow.  For example, it is displaying in kilometers per hour but the instructions don't say how to convert to miles/hour. I would probably not buy this again
This seems to be a pretty low-quality item.  I love Zelda, for certain.  But, it seems that it is more of a toy sword than a replica of any kind. Unless I missed something and Link's sword really did have a plastic handle
I have seen some really dumb things in my 46 years but this flashlight is near the top of the list.  A flashlight whose power reserve lasts only 30 minutes after 15 hours spent charging.  Sad thing is after not much more than 3 minutes the flashlight is down to half brightness.  8 minutes after turning it on the light it gives out is useless such that you would do better turning this flashlight off allowing your eyes to adjust to the darkness at least you will see more than what you did with this lame light.  I have heard some wild stories but the reality of this flashlight has me thinking the people who made this monstrosity are quite totally and completely insane living in fantasy land.This flashlight is what you buy when you just want a prop to take up space and look good because as a tool for illuminating space it is totally, utterly and profoundly useless.  Your Good Money invested in this flashlight instantly becomes money wasted with no hope of any meaningful return whatsoever.  Don't say we did not warn you!  This flashlight should have a sign on it that says I am awesomely pathetic buy at your own risk!
I BOUGHT THIS ITEM A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HURRICANE WILMA HIT SOUTH FLORIDA... I KEPT IT CHARGED FOR 2 WEEKS WITHOUT USING IT AT ALL...AFTER THE STORM HIT AND I TRIED TO USE IT THAT NIGHT... THE SPOTLIGHT STAYED ON FOR ONLY 20 MINS TOPS BEFORE IT TOTALLY RAN OUT OF POWER LUCKILY THE CAR CHARGER WAS IN THE BOX AND THE LANTERN LIGHT WORKED VERY WELL ON A FULL CHARGE...BUT I DO NOT GIVE PRAISE TO THIS ITEM AT ALL AND I GAVE IT THE CREDIT IT DESERVED THE 1 STAR IS FOR THE LANTERN AND NOT THE SPOTLIGHT...CRAPPY AT BEST...PLEASE DO NOT BU
Small print on box: Charging the spotlight takes approximately 15 hours using the AC charger adapter, and approximately 12-20 hours using the 12V car adapter. The spotlight/lantern cannot be used while charging. A full charge will provide for approximately 30 minutes of power.30 MINUTES after charging for 15 HOURS? What the heck is the point of this flashlight
Despite charging the flashlight for the required 15 hours, the light failed to shine for more than 5 minutes. Also during those lackluster minutes of operation, the emanating light seemed to be nowhere near the advertised 1 million candle power

We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!  Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars.Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.  Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor
Just disappointed is all....Wasn't what I expected and it's very cheaply made....
I ordered this bike for my granddaughters 4th birthday.  The first shipment arrived on schedule, but the box was total destroyed and without opening you could see that the bike was scratched and dented.  Delivery was refused and another bike was sent.  The 2nd bike arrived, with the box being in less than perfect condition, but delivery was accepted.  When my son started assembling the bike, he found that several of the parts had been assembled at the factory incorrectly and he could not assemble the bike.  The bike was returned for a credit and we went and purchased a similar bike locally.  We still have not received a credit for the return of the bike.  I am very disappointed and will not purchase from this vendor again
I bought this watch for work to time a 2 min procedure.  I found the 30 sec sweep hard to get used to.  I'm used to a 60 sec sweep. And the minute hand was difficult to read.  I really had to check to see if I was at 1.5 min or 2.5 min.
I only had this for about 2 days before the resistance band broke in 2 places.I would say that the ball's tension would fall under the "easy" category.I'd recommend the Power Web over this product
I found the performance of these Michelin tires to be adequate.  There doesn't seem to be too much in the way of rolling resistance and they grip the road well.  The road seems to have eaten these tires up...I have less than 1,000 miles on it and the tires are full of holes--that may say something about the quality of roads out here in Hawaii.  I'm getting a flat every time I ride.  My next tire will be something a little sturdier
excuse my english but if youre a delicate person then its good for you but if youre like myself then this product would last arround 4 days like mines,, all i did was walk to my job for half hour and it began tearing apart; it wasnt defective , its the material its made out of,,, the  product itself is a good idea but the material is delicat
I was surprised by what I got. This Flashlight is NOT BRIGHT at all. Especially when used as a lantern. I could hardly see the other side of my living room. 
I RECIEVED THE ARACHNID ELECTRONIC DART BOARD AND IT LOOKED VERY CHEAP.  THE NUMBERS LOOKED LIKE A CHILD PUT STICKERS AROUND THE BOARD.  THE ENTIRE LEFT HALF OF THE BOARD WOULD NOT REGISTER THAT THOSE NUMBERS WERE HIT BY THE DARTS.  I BOUGHT A DIFFERENT DART BOARD FROM WALMART THAT WAS CHEAPER AND WAY NICER. 
I did get a nice little buzz the first two days I took this product, and it does give you a boost when you take it right before you work out.  You can push yourself a bit further at the gym.  The gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product.  It wasn't so good or effective that the side effects were worth it.  I had no lasting weight loss when taking it, just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later.  I'd skip it
Nutrex-Lipo diet pills make me sick to my stomach. I never lost any weight at all. They just made me sick. I would not recomend them to anyone. ISh
It helps with digestion just like any other multi-digestive vitamin. It didn't really help me output a lot of energy. I didn't get the jitters or anything like that, however I would think twice before purchasing. 
There is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw. The ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side; so the open knife is not away from the set of keys. This is the first swiss army knife I have ever come across with this flaw. So alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo!!
They look nice, but they're badly put together; I had to re-sew all of the fingers within the first month
You get what you pay for. These are extremely poorly made. They were slapped together with mis-shaped finger holes and seams. Cheap and fall apart at the slights movement
This sender is "0"! to me!I bought this product on January 12th, 2007, and today is Febuary 12th, 2007, and I Still have Never received it, so I Want My Money Back or send me my Product today!!! 
I tried to use this thing, but it just goes off no matter what - even when nothing has moved. Waste of money
I am writing this as a review of Hippo clubs in general.  I purchased a simmilar set from Amazon a year ago because it was a $300 set or irons reduced to $100.  I was interested in the graphite shafts (all I have ever used is steel) and wanted a cheap set to travel with (I have had 2 different sets of clubs lost during travel).  The first thing that I noticed with these clubs was my miss-hits rose dramatically.  The clubs looked nice enough, but their performance was less than par.  When I talked with my club pro, he said that the problem with buying graphite shafted clubs that are inexpensive like these Hippos is that the shafts are cheap not consistant.  Your average pro plays with graphite shafts that cost up to $80 each.  He also indicated to me that high handicappers tend to buy cheap clubs (which was a humbling fact that I had to swallow), and that high handicappers tend to play better with steel shafts.  All of this being said, I chalked up my $100 mistake and began looking locally at all of the golf shops for high-quality pre-owned clubs.  After 2 weeks, I found a hardly used set of '04 Big Berthas for $359.  I talked the salesman down to $299 and walked out with the best set of clubs that I have ever hit.  I guess my point is that if you are looking at these clubs, you are either a new or relatively unskilled player-- like me.  If this is the case, take some time and search out high-quality pre-owned or used equipment that will make your learning curve my shorter.  Let the golfers that get new clubs every two years spend $600-$1000 for new sets.  Take advantage of their trade-ins.  That's my opinion anyway
I had to repurchase this product, because my first one broke, the hinge that they use to attach the battery door to is pathetic, seriously a design flaw. However, with some Epoxy glue and a different type of hinge you can modify the origional product to be something better. In this case you really get what you pay for... Its dirt cheap plastic and it breaks easily. I wouldnt recommend getting this unless you need something dirt cheap and only plan on using it a few times.
Stay away from this prodcut. Manual sucks...and the product is horrible....there is no way this thing is going to work.
The only satisfaction I have gotten out of this product is this opportunity to vent.  If the price seems too cheap, it is.  Where to begin?  Instructions, pretty bad.  Hardware, missing, inconsistent, inadequate.  Design, deeply flawed.  Mounting, not on my standard mountain bike.  Manufacture, cheap, cheap, cheap.What result culminated my frustrating evening retrofitting it just to see if it would work?  I'll spare you the suspense, it didn't.  Not a glimmer.
The velcro belt tore off after the second use! Within a week of Purchase!  The material for the vest is not durable enough for so much weight
I bought a pair of these as a workout set for heavy bag use, and have been mostly disappointed with them for that purpose.Pros: Easy on and off, even putting them on by yourself. Wrist straps are simple and hold well. Breathe surprisingly well for the design.Cons: Even with hand wraps on, I found my right glove to fit too poorly to absorb punches well; the design makes it hard to form a proper fist without trying to grip the glove into a proper position to do so. The left I have no problem with for some reason, maybe just have a bad pair? The padding makes blows glance off of the bag to a degree that it made me feel like I was risking injury when using them for actual impact punches. Grips make my hands feel too open when punching, can't grip a tight fist... my hands would be bruised or very sore after even a modest workout with them
This product falls into the category of "not worth the cost of shipping" for me.  The bag is a basic black nylon bag that is adequate for holding a large yoga mat.  The bag was shipped in an envelope via USPS first class mail for $1.35.  SAMFE was the retailer that Amazon used for this transaction, so Free Super Saver Shipping was not available.  SAMFE charged $7.50 for shipping.  I generally stay away from retailers who charge shipping in order to boost their profits, hence the low-star rating for an otherwise adequate product
we bought 2 of these "things" they both literally fell apart within 2 weeks of receiptthe stitching, in various parts of the bag came undone, we ended up throwing them away.i've been purchasing things on line since 1995, and this product was by far the WORST thing we've ever bought!!!run away, run away
I bought my free-standing heavy bag at a local store and I was very excited to try my new product.  When I got home I was in for a shock.  There were at least sixteen screws, locks, and washers in a little bag.  In addition to that, there was about twelve additional pieces that needed to be put together.  All in all, it took me about two hours to put this puzzle together and eventhough it weighs about 275 pounds once it's filled with water, it does not take much to move it around when striking during a workout.  I need to keep readjusting the base back to its original position every three to four punches I throw on it.  For the amount of money that I paid, this bag should have been put together for me.  I will keep the bag and put it outside.  If somebody steals it, they will be doing me a favor.  Next time I will go with what I know and buy a wavemaster from Century, now that is an awesome product
I didn't read in the instructions that I was also buying a dancing partner.  This thing just *will not* stay still.  I tried putting it on carpet and on wood floors, but the water weight just isn't enough to keep it still.  Power punching causes the base to tip and then slam back to the floor making a terrible racket.  If I lived in an apartment, my neighbors would hate me.  The water ends up around 200lbs (when full) and just doesn't do the trick.  I have been thinking of using sand which tops out around 320lbs, but not sure how easy it will be to get back out since the only opening is a small opening on top meant for water.As for springiness, you can definitely wail on this thing and it can take it (by moving across the floor), but in my opinion it's TOO springy.  There is no comparison to hitting a hanging bag.  It definitely needs a tension adjustment.I'd say this bag is probably better for practicing control.  I wouldn't suggest this for an apartment if you plan on power-hitting
     I won't mention about the quality of this product. But this standbag doesn't have enough weight to stand my punch. I filled this with water to the full, and when I throw a hook the front part goes up in the air and comes down. Am I supposed to fill this up with lead?          I'm not bragging. I am below average young males' heights and weights, I don't work out, never had a boxing training, just sometimes visit the gym with sandbags and throw punches when I'm depressed.          I can't believe those guys who wrote the reviews are so weak to be satisfied with this stuff. I'm returning this and get a real heavy bag, even if it will cost a lot
I've had this product about a month, purchased from a sporting goods store - at first all was well.  Unfortunately the bag became shakier and shakier as time progressed.  I had to reset the screws (as other reviews for this product have mentioned) - but one screw WOULD not come out.  It was stripped.  A week later, same problem.  I tend to hit the bag about 2 hours a day 3 times a week and 1 hour a day the rest of the week.  Apparently hitting it causes the screws to warp the holes of metal centerpiece which connects the stand  bag to the base.  This causes either:a) screws to stripb) the holes to enlarge and warp, meaning screws no longer catch.Apparently whoever designed this product forgot that a punching bag is made to be struck and hit.Today finally the bag got KO'ed because now only two holes in the metal centerpiece out of eight will actually securely catch the screws.  I'm a 6'1 220 lb. guy and I'm only using about half of my full force into my punches (again, I hit it just about every day) - so in other words this bag is definitely not intended for heavy-duty use.  I'll call Everlast Monday and keep my fingers crossed that the replacement part is made sturdier than the original
This handlebar mount mirror was most disappointing. The adjustable mirror shaft has next to no memory and creeps into a position which is totally unusable. Don't risk your safety or your dollars on this product. It's simply not worth the inexpensive price
I bought this stroller because it looked nice and sturdy.  I liked the stroller with air-filled wheels and other features such as brake and wheel-locks.  However, this stroller is so cumbersome if you have a compact car.  Even with my Acura, I still have to take apart the front wheel to fit the stroller in the trunk.  Imagine you have your kid and have to assembly your stroller in a before your walk.  It's inconvenient and takes up lots of space in your car's trunk.  I was mislead by Amazon description of the stroller that it would fit in trunk of any car.  Yes it would fit but you have to take apart the front wheel to make it fit in. 
I bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it, so I thought I might like the Alps chair too.  I was wrong. It's very light weight, but it's a lot longer than my other chairs, which made it more difficult to carry and transport.  The arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings, one of which broke the first time I used the chair.  The next day, three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points, throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless.  Save your money on this one
these clubs are a waste of money.  The graphite shafts from cougar in a senior flex that is way uncontrollable unless u are 75.  My 8 iron broke the first time i hit it.  The bag is falling apart.  Save ur money and buy a quality set of clubs.  U can get some clone clubs that will last years and u'll play twice as better for just a tad more
holy jesus this gun is to over priced and is to powerful to be a air soft gun i meen dam its just not righ
Package missing.  It's never be received.  So I cannot rate it
Got my Bowflex weeks ago and having trouble, lots of trouble putting it together. It's not the product's fault other than the fact that putting together is a real 'mutha. Seems the parts could've been marked better. Identification is pretty much visual. Instead, you have a "picture map" to compare what part is needed. I was doing fine until I inserted the wrong bolt, stripped the bolt trying to get it out, got the WD40 on it, finally had to use a crescent wrench. So, my confidence is blown and then I continued on to assemble the seat backwards. The assemblage directions could be better, believe me. I used the 800# once, but I finally found that no matter what was suggested, the picture was misleading and there's no way that could've been explained. Onward through the fog!
When I purchased a pair of these gloves a couple of years ago, I had high hopes.  My hands become cold easily, and I was looking forward to wearing gloves that would actively help in warming them.I will admit that these gloves are respectable as normal, unheated gloves.  They are fairly well insulated and provide a moderate degree of dexterity.However, the heating element is ineffective.  Inserting batteries into the gloves provided little (if any) increase in warmth.  My fingers remained cold.In addition, I have recently discovered that the thin wire connecting the heating element to the battery in one of the gloves has become disconnected.  These gloves have not been subjected to any harsh abuse, so it is disappointing to find that the wire had been disconnected so easily.If you are looking for a pair of heated gloves that will actually make a difference and keep your hands (including your fingers)warm, look elsewhere
I ordered electric gloves.  I RECIEVED ELECTIRC SOX.  I would like the gloves to be sent to me.  I can use the sox so would pay for them separately.  The gloves were $29.95 the sox were $19.95 so I should have a $10 credit.If you can correct this error, it would be appreciated.R Heins
The product picture and description do not match actual item sent. If you look on ebay, it is the same item that malibu wholesale starts bidding at .99. It does not weigh 6#, but actual weight of item is around 12 oz. It is cheaply made and not designed to last
the brace or axle to hold the goal in an upright position was to short and couldn't be used. A new one had to be purchased
well it was shown as a Full tang double bladed katana but after buying the item and checking it out for myself i have found its nothing more than a rat tailed show piece...as far as show pieces go it does look nice however its not the Full Tang construction i was expecting to see and feel when i bought it.Fast shipping though
I purchased this item based on the picture.  I didn't want a cheap looking air-hockey table because I planned to keep it for a long time.  The price seemed good for the looks of the table even though the shipping was $150.  Arranging delivery with the carrier was a bit awkward, but not too bad, but the box itself was clearly abused and showed a general lack of care in handling.  I don't know if the abuse was from the carrier delivering it to me or prior carrier, but it did have me worried about the condition of the contents.  I couldn't see any parts through the holes and tears in the box, so I hoped for the best.  When I opened the box, there was no obvious shipping damage, however there was one spot on the surface that could have been caused by improper packaging.The assembly instructions were a poor quality photocopy that cut the top line off most pages.  There was a separate sheet of paper instructing me to line up letter tags during assembly, however, the tags were not properly placed and assembly per the diagram on the sheet would have been impossible.  Assuming all parts were symmetrical worked just as well.I was also disappointed with the quality of the assembly of the main components.  Alignment was poor, making final assembly difficult, and there was excessive adhesive all over the place, even on the playing surface.  I was able to remove most of the adhesive from the playing surface except for one spot that may have been damage from shipping.  The table comes with a 90 warranty on materials and workmanship, but doesn't include shipping.  As the table surface is the largest component, I'm imagining it would cost most of the $150 shipping fee to have it replaced.  At this point, I'm not willing to sink any more money into this table.After the table was set up, I was hoping it would at least play well.  I was disappointed there too.  There are some plastic guards on the goals that make scoring very difficult.  I've never seen anything like them on other tables.  By the time you get the puck moving fast enough to evade your opponents blocking of the small opening your shooting for, it fly's off the table.  In fact you spend more time retrieving the puck than you do playing.  Maybe this has something to do with the extra adhesive down the sides of the playing surface, but it still ruins the game.  There were a lot of excited kids when the table arrived.  They all played about one game and now the table sits unused.All in all, this has been my most disappointing online purchase.  I guess there are some things you see first hand before you buy
I love the lenses but these goggles are painful to wear.  I tried various adjustments but they are still too uncomfortable.  I sent an email to Speedo  to let them know.
I ordered and received this item through The Golf Warehouse. It arrived and I immediately saw a defect,in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly, even with major force. I contacted the Golf Wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them. I requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me. Since then I have tried to contact David Leadbetter's organization but without any success. I am desperately unhappy about this purchase and, in particular, the after sales service.Derek Price  Toronto, O
I bought this toy for my 9 month old son for Christmas. He loved it and it is a wonderful toy. However, in mid January it started to sound as if the batteries were dying and then it just quit. I replaced the batteries but to my disappointment it still wouldn't work. I tried different batteries again just to be sure and still nothing. I had a very hard time finding out how to contact imaginarium.com and finally just emailed amazon. They responded quickly and it appears that I will be able to return the toy and my son liked it enough that I may take my chances and buy it again. There are mixed reviews some saying that it is durable and works great and a few like mine
Our kids loved this - so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on/off button (making the toy unusable), I bought another one.  Wouldn't you know the same thing happened a few weeks later?  This toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion...the manufacturer needs to correct this problem
My husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it. they were so disappointed:( this has now happened twice!!!!! fyi, the first one we inflated and it deflated within days (slow leak). what a waste! it is so heavy that it would cost $20 to mail it back for a replacement. don't bother.
For the price, I shouldn't complain, but what the heck?  What ever happened to quality control?  It came double shrink wrapped.  There was a plastic handle guard that didn't fit the sword, so I had to just throw it away.  Very little pride in the product.  The wood was roughly sanded before it was painted.  Well, it's just a stick afterall.  I'm just glad I did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor, DreamObjects.  Read their feedback responses -- sounds a lot like aggressive Ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback.  Sorry -- waste of my time and a few dollars.  I gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you can't tell quality from a single digital photo
I purchased this rack a few months ago and it is very neat. Problem is that it does tend to move when you put the MTX bag on. The movement becomes more of a problem as the weight of the bag increases. Another problem was getting enough clearance between the rack and the tire if you are short like me and don't have the seat raised up really far. If you play around enough you can get it to work, but if you decide to put on the Topek rear fender (which I did)you may have to adjust your seat a little higher than might be comfortable. I just got accustomed to having the seat a little higher. Bottom line is that Topek has made a very neat system that just needs a few more refinements (and some better instructions) to make it perfect. 
These seats, while they are as nice as they look, do not fit into a "seat" at the stadium, rendering them USELESS!  They take up 1.25 seats per, and if you are at a sold out game you will not be able to use them, especially if you have 2.  They need to make them a few inches smaller
Due to lack of space, and in need of activity I have decided to buy a mini stepped to increase my daily phsycial activity. This one I bought from a retail market and the reason for me to choose particularly this one was the price (of course), the flexbands with counter.Very limited documentation, it doesn't tell you actually how you can adjust the difficulty levet, I figured out a better way after two weeks by experimenting the device. And then it sarted to make craking noises. So I used some olive oil on the joints that passed. Then The suspensions got air inside and at the very begging of the step it started to make a crack noise which I couldn't evade at all.While experirmenting the device, the electronic part got loose, it was attached with a soo thin cable, one touch and the cable was torn off. OK I said that was my fault, I shouldn't have touched it.But...Today, the `steel` cable that holds the pedals got apart. That is so suprizing, I am only 80 kg, and using it usually every two days for 30 minutes... Very bad construction.Ok... Why I gave 2 stars? The flexicables worked really well. That deserves a point. 
I bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking.But after I say 2-3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars, at a critical point. I did carry a heavy backpack in the basket. But still I think the basket is a piece of junk.Plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork, which limits your height of your handlebars. The basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable. I can't recommend this basket.Buy a basket from your local sports authority or something.thanksDaRealDeal
The snap on the Leapers "Elite" Drop Leg Holster (the term Elite must be used loosely) would never stay attached. It would always either unsnap or come loose at the back. Eventually it fell off in the field and I lost it. The straps would never stay securely in the place I positioned them. The Leapers Deluxe Drop Leg Holster is much more effective. Even w/ one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place. The method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well. Spend a few more dollars for the Deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the Elite
This was the 2nd DVD with problems that I bought from this vendor.  The first DVD had 2 sections where the DVD would pause but would continue playing, and I was willing to live with it.  Bootcamp/Muscle Endurance, on the other hand, would not play the Muscle Endurance workout at all!  I contacted the vendor and they said it was a problem with my DVD player and they would only allow me to exchange with any of their 'OPEN' dvds only to 'better suite my needs'.  I own 20+ workout DVDs and none of them gave me any problems like this one did.  The DVD is also fairly pricey and so I'm afraid to buy any more of these dvds from them.  I was able to play the Bootcamp workout until towards the end (before the cool down section) where it would not continue playing.  I like Cathe's workout very much.  The part of Bootcamp that I was able to play was excellent! But I am very disappointed with this vendor
terrible customer service, absolutely the worse. Do not order from this website.  I had a bad tape and it would NOT play,  they refused to credit my account, insinuated that I had a "duped" copy from somewhere else!
do not waste your money. I wish I could give it zero star
Well I purchased this bike because I previously had a Schwinn recumbent bike that I was pretty happy with but had to sell it because I moved. I'm very disappointed with this upright bike though. I think the seat is very very uncomfortable, so uncomfortable that I don't want to use the product. The seat design in itself it horrible. The way it bolts on is a little strange, and it appears all the Schwinn upright models are like this. Even though I have the seat bolted down all the way, it still wiggles. As others have mentioned, my box came trashed all ripped and with holes in it. In fact, the UPS driver actually told me that I might want to refuse the product, but I took it anyways. I think I'm going to attempt to return this if possible. Although the entire process is a huge hassle since I work everyday, the box is trashed, and how heavy the product is. I also had to help the UPS driver carry it up to my 3rd floor apt. I don't recommend any Schwinn upright bikes, although I likes their recumbent series. I hope Amazon will help me come up with a solution to return this
I purchased a new 26" Men's Huffy Cranbrook Cruiser Bike. After assembly, to my surprise the rear wheel would not inflate because of a bad inner tube.So what do you do, disassemble and return? No, call Huffy and they take you through nine hoops.  Finally they sent me the right part which took ten days, and I took the bike to a local fix it shop which charged me $15 labor to fix the rear wheel.No savings!P.S. The bike is a piece of junk made in China.  The instruction manual is nearly useless
The bike I ordered wouldve been a great Christmas present had it not been dropped a few hundred times before I received it, both fenders damaged badly, and paint scraped off the frame in 3 spots
just got it today and i am kinda mad there is a small leak near the top so i have to keep it upright or the bag gets soaked. the pack itself though is very nice, many pocekts for keys, cell phone, ipod, ect
This step sucks.  If you are used to doing step classes at the gym, you will find it difficult to switch to this smaller step.  I didn't know it was a smaller step or I wouldn't have bought it.  It is hard to adjust to the shorter step, especially when doing a turn step or V step.  It ends up being VERY close to a basic step.  I was so nervous about stepping too close to the end and flipping the whole step up, that I was cheating myself out of a full workout.  DO NOT buy this, if you're used to the step at the club.  I feel like it's more dangerous on this, and ended up doing a lot of the steps on the floor.  If you already know that you like to step, buck up and buy the club size step, even though it is twice the price of this one.  Otherwise, don't buy anything
The way these bags are constructed - or supposed to be - is that they are stuffed with fibers, and filled with sand, for weight, AT THE BOTTOM -  the part you DON'T punch.I was wondering why it felt like I was punching a brick wall on the left side: that's where they stuck the bags of sand. Just what a fighter needs before a fight (or anyone needs at any time of their life) - to be punching compacted bags of crushed rock.This is a clear defect: I am considering returning it. Not sure if they're all like this, but I assume mine is not unique. Can't find where it says it was manufactured, but in this day and age, and based on the "craftsmanship", it's reasonable to assume China. Hey - at least the cardboard box it came in was made in Missouri!Mine also suffered a little damage during shipping: the box had a small hole in it and the bag got scuffed. It usually takes years of pounding before this type of damage occurs on it's own.Hey, it's hit or miss when you order online, particularly with oversized items, as far as shipping an "handling" are concerned. The shipping box was damaged and oil stained, the product poorly constructed. So, I'd call this a "miss"
I bought both the Ark III and the Super Ark.  The Super Ark is a slight improvement over the Ark III but I would never recommend people buy either one.  There are far better entry-level kits, for just a few dollars more, available from other sources.  The Ark III contains 24 oz. of water, a food bar, and a small, inexpensive emergency blanket in a Kleenex-sized cardboard box.  I'll use the products in the two kits to supplement the emergency kits I subsequently purchased.I'm surprised - and disappointed - Amazon carries these products
Tent leaks in multiple places; including door seam, back panel, and through seams on Rainfly!  This is NOT normal condensation (I promise), but leaks that resulted in two bath towels and one sleeping bag getting soaked.  The tent was set up according to instructions with Rainfly secure and failed to keep its occupants (2 adults and a three year old) dry during a rain. Made for a miserable experience. 
This gun is a piece of $#!My bro got it some time ago. He was so excited. It made me glad to see that he was so gung ho about his new airsoft. He loaded it, aimed at a 1-foot target not more than 20 feet away, sprayed as accurately as possible, and guess what happened...?Yup, out of the 20 in the clip, about 5 or 6 hit. Not on the bull's eye, I can tell you that. The 20 shots went wayyyyyyy too fast for comfort, and the accuracy sucked like mad, but my brother's hopes were not dashed yet. (-_-)He filled up the 110-shot mag, winded it up, aimed, and the same thing resulted, only this time, the spray lasted longer than 3.5 seconds.OUT OF MAYBE 50 SHOTS FIRED, ABOUT 12 HIT. I checked the gun all around, but it was not defective at all, except for the part that this gun was made very cheaply.My brother tried it on semi-auto, which is usually more accurate. Not for this gun, though. In fact, the semi-auto was even less accurate than the automatic feature!!! OUT OF 10 SHOTS, ONE OR TWO HIT! i COULDN'T TELL BECAUSE THIS GUN'S 140 FPS MADE BARELY A SOUND WHEN IT HIT THE TARGET! (We were shooting in the dark.)Let's not even talk about the "red dot scope," or the "silencer."I only gave it a two because (1) That is the next lowest you can give, and (2) This gun's looks is okay. Please buy a different gun off ebay or something!!! You can get an m16 with a grenade launcher with 300 fps and 300 mag cap for less than 20 bucks (if you bid correctly)!By the time my brother had finished playing, his dopamine levels were probably under normal. In simple terms, he was disappointed
       I recieved this gun about a week ago and couldn't wait for it to arrive. It managed to arrive one day early because I live close to it's store in California. When I recieved it I couldn't figure out why I could not mount the scope. It was broken. Next I tried to read the instructions which are total crap because they are awfully written. I started to shoot it and every time I wanted to use the larger clip I had to jam it into the socket every time it stopped shooting, which was quite often.               Next I had my sister shoot me with it from about 10 feet away and didn't even feel it when the BB's hit in a T-shirt. Plus, aftera while of shooting the semi-automatic started to fail and it would only shoot automatic. Lastly, in it's first CQB the strap fell completely off. Here are the main good's and bad's of this gun.Good:-relatively cheap-lays down a lot of BB's in a short amount of time.-collapsable stock is nice.-relativly accuracte at close rangeBad:-Clips either tiny or worthless because it won't stay in the gun.-extremely weak-accesories may come broken.-insructions awful.-low battery life.-fire settings jam/don't work P.S I'm not really Jacqueline K. Schmidt
Good points of the EL-300: Powerful sharp beam; LONG run per battery change; easy on-off quick-mount clamp for anti-theft; and, it's a superb FLASHLIGHT. I like to use it for undersink and underhood repairs, so I often borrow it from my bike. This light is intense enough to force a person to avert eyes, if the beam hits direct from even, say 40 away. Cateye does caution us not to play the beam on people's eyes. In my estimate, it is mostly a terrific flashlight, and not a great bike-mounted headlight, at least as a stand-alone.Trouble is, that sharp-focused narrow beam makes you choose between two conflicting and shifting essentials: lighting your path (you actually CAN with this focused power); or alerting others to your presence. That would mean focusing it more toward oncoming traffic, or a tad right or left, toward peripheral traffic, depending where you are, and how the road tracks, and where cars are coming from. It's a real attention-getter to oncoming drivers, which is great, if conditions are all just right: IF you focus the lamp near level, and if the drivers are considerate enough to all approach from in front of your beam. However, traffic off to the side is another deal, since the headlight's peripheral light suffers by contrast. I nearly took a short trip to a long rest, as a result. Late on a quiet night, one flaky guy entering a major, broad secondary road I was traveling was coming fast up to his stop-sign, on a side street to my right, ahead of where I had just rounded a curve. He had a view accross broad lawns, on up the dark road behind me.After slowing just a bit, he accelerated and ran his stop sign. I was right near his position on his side-street, "committed," pedaling about 15 - 17 MPH, about to cross his bow. He started his right turn, gunning it, merging with unseen ME. He was totally UNAWARE OF ME, and was clearly of this mindset:          "No double-CAR-headlights,          no CAR noise,          so no CAR,           so nuttin' coming,           so, good-to-go, so -- GUN IT!" ... all in the space of a couple seconds.Moving fast, with the right-of-way, I had the EL-300 blazing away bright. Only, it was focused straight ahead of me, and a tad downward toward the road surface yards in front. I was dependent on the EL-300, to send ahead to the likes of him, unavoidable announcing LIGHT. It's what I paid for (about $45.00 delivered). I also wore a white helmet, had reflective stripes on my panniers and rack trunk, and the churning reflectors on wheels and pedals. But I know darn well all the reflectors in the world have no merit, when not bathed by headlights, and if not also bouncing back at a narrow angle to the driver's eyes. That's why I own a headlight. It's why now-enlightened NJ demands a bike headlight.Of course, neither does a DRIVER have any merit, when s/he rewrites the stopsign law to read "No need to stop as long as I don't SEE ANYONE COMING." He nearly killed me, coming fast at me, broadside. He had regained nearly 15 or more mph as he started his right turn, still accelerating, when he spotted me and panic-braked. We were at one point about 2 feet apart, thanks to his hard braking, and my veering left on the (luckily deserted) dark main road. I was, for a fraction of a second, looking DOWN at his headlights and bumper almost below me. Could have reached over and touched his hood ornament. Incredible experience. It was my closest call ever, and scared the hell out of me. It must've scared the hell out of him, too. He registered his shock-and-awe with a reproaching after-fact horn blast, as he scrambled around and passed me, racing off before I could read his plate.I guess it must've ticked him off, my scaring HIM with that close call. One little vehicular manslaughter can change your address awhile. Equally maddening for him, after he passed the intruding cyclist with the red blinkie taillight, and the white helmet, and all the reflectors (THOSE alerted him, once I was his front-and-center target), he would had to then see that blazing headlight's pencil-beam in his rear-view mirror. Damn, nuttin' he could blame on this creep on the bike. :-[The EL-300 simply failed me that time, as I see it, by focusing most of its light in a narrow, long-projecting beam. It was focused left of where he was looking, when I was very close to the side street he was traveling, ignoring his stop-sign. There should, from so much light energy, be some part diverted wider, closer to the bike, even if lower intensity.In my judgement there are two related design flaws with this lamp:1. The narrow focused beam, making you "live(??) with" the single direction in which you aim the beam. Its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost in any ambient light. 2. That is in turn aggravated by its wandering from the aiming you settle on, both vertically and horizontally. The vertical part is the worse; the mounting clamp sets too far back from the headlight's balance-point, so it's a seesaw that's forward-heavy. Lift your bike front, tap it down lightly, and you've likely refocused the lamp lower, as you would not if the mounting were at the balance-point. Aim it temporarily right (and tight), and you are seemingly good to go ... but only as far as the first noticeable bump. It then drops a few degrees, and you keep correcting it vertically, to light EITHER your intended path, or the oncoming drivers' windshields. Your need is like being at the Oscars: you want to both see, and BE SEEN, only in this case to save your life.I am chasing after another LED lamp now, which I understand to have a wider (along with brighter) beam. I have respect for Cateye in general. Their current website page of battery-op headlamps does not offer the EL-300.
I ordered 2 of these flimsy tables.  They were not only expensive to ship, but one arrived damaged.  The one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully, meaning that people's drinks would slide off the table.  These are the most flimsy tables I have ever encountered. If it weren't for the replacement tables I found at costco, the party I planned would have been a disaster. 
Like other users, I found the light output substandard. I bought it specifically as an emergency light source. If I really needed this light, there really would be an emergency! Absolutely pathetic
I really wanted to like this lantern. It is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price, but the light output is pathetic. The package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it, but I find that doubtful. The light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob Princeton Tec or Photon. In fact, I think you could read a map, or a book, play cards, or follow a trail, more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights. I'm returning mine.
I purchased this product from Performance bike to replace a much older (10yr) CatEye wired computer. I have a certain amount of brand loyalty to CatEye because their products are typically of higher quality (almost always manufactured in Japan as opposed to China) and typically last a long time, like the aforementioned 10-year-old cycle-computer. I purchased this product without much hesitation, but was disappointed with the unusually stripped feature set. The CatEye Vectra is missing two critical functions: ride timing, and average speed: features even my 10-year-old Velo2 computer has. It offers only current speed, max, odometer, clock, and trip distance. The overall quality of the unit is good, and I'm sure it will last for years with the solid Japanese construction, but I'll seek another unit because the missing features make it unusable for my purposes. Luckily, the sender unit magnetic pickup is reverse and cross compatible with CatEye's other wireless computers, i.e. it works with my older CatEye Cordless 2 computer also. Bottom Line: Pick another CatEye model and watch the feature set carefully
I bought it given reviews by others, but my one must have been faulty coz it worked for about 1 second after installing it and it hasn't worked ever since.  I'd suggest any would be buyer pay a bit more for something that works
It is reasonably accurate. The numbers displayed are formed irregularly. You can't zero it out by zeroing one category i.e. Distance. The price is reflective of its quality
Made of a soft steel, the legs' attachment is a bit flimsy, so it leans forward too much. May not accommodate bikes with disk brakes (the upper hook is too low for the wide frame opening). I had to drill a hole and move the hook closer to the top of the stand to make it hold my 26" mountain bike
I'm in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official NFL football from a previous year and I wanted to get another one for backup. I know 'The Duke' is supposed to be the official NFL ball from this year, but there seems to be something wrong with the balls Amazon is shipping. The first ball I got from Amazon was hard as a rock, slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces. I got a second one and the stitching was a bit better, but it was still hard and slippery. And when it was exposed to rain, the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring. I have no clue if that's to be expected or not since it's all leather but it seems odd.  In any case, you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves, which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball. So, it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe I play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands (which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls). Maybe the footballs just need to be broken in, but I'm not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them, which no one seems to want to do. I've tried to let some air out to make the things more user-friendly, but it doesn't really help. Anyway, I find it really hard to believe this is the ball the NFL played with this year. Something about them just seems cheaply made. In any case, I suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball. 
This is very heavy and hard to fit anywhere for storage. Very hard to use even when you adjust the tension to a low setting. I tried working out on it for about a week and gave up...it will most likely be tossed
I have been looking for nice Ti set for camping, and finally found it in Amazon at very cheap price! The Ti set is really light and good for backpackers. Unfortunately, I found one my of set (I bought 2 sets) got manufacturing defects, the fork is bent at a smaller angle, which looks quite weird when I stack them together. Hope Brunton should do better QA on their products.Apart from this, the Ti set is quite nice! But buy with your own risk (you never know the angle problem if you buy 1 set only!)
While this rack looks good, and appears well constructed, it's mounting system leaves something to be desired. While attempting to lock this unit down tight enough to keep it from constantly twisting around, I managed to bend the locking lever. Now don't get me wrong, this is mounted on my wife's bike (a cruiser) and has had at most 10 lbs of groceries in the handy basket you can purchase that slides right on. But having to stop every so often to straighten this thing out is quite annoying. I suppose I will end up modifying the locking mechanism to avoid further aggravation. By the way, I have a Delta rear rack on my ATB that mounts to the seat post using a 4 bolt clamp. Much sturdier, and it was much less expensive, as well
i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift. at first he was thrilled to get a new one. upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it, he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain, making it almost impossible (and very uncomfortable) to use. He had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way. He did, however, like the other features, namely the light and the pen.
Terrible assemble. I coudln't even assembel front wheel.The axle is way short, and no axle nut. So there's no way to place wheel in fork drop outs
Do not buy this bike. I got to ride mine for about 35 minutes before it was broke. The crank is cheap aluminum and the peddals are steal, well the steal threads chew right through the aluminum in no time flat.
the design of this product (that it is a backpack) is PERFECT for my husband's lunch at work, HOWEVER, it is too small for the two or three medium-sized gatorade bottles and lunch contents
This item was sent back the sleeping bag was not sent and was on the invoice.  I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY REFUND CHECK.  This is the first time I have had any problems with items sent on Amazon.  I like Amazon because I can send a personal check and not a credit card.  Please send me my refund.Candice M. TresslerJanuary 9, 200
These are fast but inaccurate and break easily bet bigger and more accurate bb'
This tent is not designed for the rain, instead of running off it collects on the top.  If left unattended, it pools up until the poles bend and the entire this collapes unrepairable
I recently purchased this item and with the first nite of rainfall....it crashed down. The cheap metal sides were bent and it became useless. A waste of over three hundred dollars
These skates are very comfortable... but within ten minutes the stopper had busted. No wonder this item is no longer being sold. :
Very lightweight, fragile, and poorly finished. Not sure what the "hardwood" actually is. It looks oak-like, but is far too lightweight for it's size. It came a bit rough and splintery and only got worse over time. The lacquer or whatever it is that they finished it with developed spiderweb cracks almost immediately and then began to flake off. I only used it for kata; didn't feel safe actually hitting anything with it let alone using it to defend against a weapon for tandem drills. After a few months of very little use, mostly sitting on the rack, it began to develop cracks. Perhaps it wasn't dried properly when they applied the finish? Regardless, the one I received (50" model) was cheap junk. You get what you pay for... Not only not recommended, but downright dangerous if you hit anything with it. Spend a little more to get better quality
This Is a cool gun BUT...Has NO acuracy and the instruction manual is really hard to read i like it as a side arm but only in tight situations
well... the first day i got it i popped in the battires and really thought it was good. i dry-shot it a few times and showed off to my dad because he got me a horrible spring pistol for christmas.i charged it for a couple of hour and put some bbs in and shot some. its the slowest shooting gun ive ever seen! it wouldnt hurt even at point blank! but i kinda recomend it for 4 year old backyard games. 1.5 out of 5
Well, i got through about a clip and a half before it started breaking.  First it went from semi-auto to uncontrolled auto, then it just stopped working.  It was pretty cool for a bit, and is pretty light and easy to set up, but I'd suggest looking somewhere else for a pistol
This would be a great tube, except it forces you to sit up in an uncomfortable position.  Unless you're worried about your posture when hanging out at the lake, find another tube
Wow I thought THULE was THE company for this type of stuff.  Boy was I mad after a trip from NJ to SC.  The bag was mounted to my roofrack and was a little noisy (top be expected).  But when I got to SC and opened the bag....the horror!  The inside lining shredded and flaked off on everything!   There were also 2 holes along the to seam!  What a mess...and I couldn't use the bag on the way home....had to ship my stuff home!  I just wrote THULE....we'll see if they come thru for the customer Sept. 12, 2005 THULE sent me a replacement, an Escape 2.  Great customer service....but does this mean the Escape is better?  Is the Quest inferior?  There was no coorespondence with the repalcement...I'll try it out this summer
I bought this to replace a C-Strobe light I used as a tail-light on my bicycle.  The C-Strobe was bright, flashed bright enough to make car drivers complain, and waterproof, just not rugged enough to survive being run over by a truck when it fell off my backpack.  This one was by the same manufacturer with "strobe action" and 1/3 the cost.It doesn't flash, the "strobe action" is the way it appears to flash as you go in and out of the side ring of light.  It isn't anywhere near as bright as the C-Strobe.  I'm going to get a C-Strobe later this month from a local boating dealer
I was very disappointed with the Ironman Speed Jump Rope. It is made of cheap plastic and, even after a month of hanging from my 2nd floor banister with a weight on the end, it's still coiled and kinked. It's impossible to jump with it as you never know when one of the kinks will bump the bottom of your foot. I would not buy it again, even for the low price charged by Amazon
This Bobber Cooler is definitely a conversation piece.  I have had so many comments about it. I used it when floating down a small river near home (No Rapids, just calm water), it doesn't hold its weight, literally. The first thing is that the opening is in the center of the cooler, making it impossible to get drinks out with out pulling the whole cooler out of the water.  The opening seam rides just barely about the water, and since it is round the weight shifts a little and the seam will dip into the water. The cooler then fills up with water, which almost immediatly melts the ice, and as it fills up it will sink to the bottom.  maybe if there was a rubber gasket to seal it better, it might be ok.  The 2 plastic clasps on each side used to close the cooler are really easy to break off, plus they are facing the wrong direction. If you bump something like a rock or a log, it will push the clasp back and then unlatch the cooler.This cooler might be good to use in bodys of water that do not have current, like a pool, but I don't suggest towing it behind anything.  I suggest using one of the many inflateble coolers on the market
These ear plugs I feel were misrepresented in that the picture shows one type (the kind I wanted), but what was sent to me was not at all what was in the picture.  I did return them without any difficulty
I bought 2 sets of this speedo ear plugs.  Those 2 sets shipped to me are different as shown online.  They aren't that comfortable while plug into the ears, the rings of the rubber are a little too thick and hard.
did not come with supressor or laser and the sight broke within 3 shots do not bu
 The only way other people can thnk it is a good gun is because when they first get it they look and say, cool. well it cant even shoot, so its not cool. this isnt just mine either its all of them cause it cant shoot because its made by the cheapest plastic, and i looked inside its only held together by the outside. the laser is off target (and sucks)and it shots as fast as u can throw it, if it shoots. I had this for about ten minutes before i thought that i got 13 dollars ript off. it fell apart after 1 hour. it couldnt shoot after 5 minutes.Dont get this gun cause it isnt just mine its the way its made. those othe reviews are people who probly dont ever use it and probly never have used it
It is NOT worth the money. It broke the first day I got it and with the silencer and all that crap it doesn't shoot. The BBs fall out the front. It jammed like 6 times before it broke. This gun is somewhat accurate but doesnt hurt at all. It sucks a lot. Don't buy any products from HotImport Toys, they are cheap, worthless, and extremely breakable
I never write reviews, but I had to make my comments on these socks. I bought them to keep my feet warm at me desk at work.  I put them on and turned the switch to high.  They DO NOT EVEN GET WARM at all...I thought it was broken, but realized it was both socks that didn't get warm. These are a total rip off and I am going to try and send them back. 
I used this ball with exercise video 4 times.  On the 5th day, my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded, sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole.  
If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else
Used once. Unit Blew a fuse. No manufacturer supplied info on fuse and none on the fuse body. No contact information was provided by manufacturer or seller. Had to calculate fuse rating.Unit is very slow to make coffee.Power plug does not fit well in 12V accessory recepticles. Does not go deep enough into recepticle to hold itself in place, has a tendency to pop out of the recepticle.No return information provded.Considering all the problems, I would not buy another product from this manufacturer, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Unit is overpriced
I'm sure the mat would have been fine, but they mixed up my order, and this company does not refund shipping, which was almost the price of the mat-- lame
When I first got the bike, I thought it was great. By 2nd ride the chain broke while I was trying to do a simple down shift. Unfortunately it also took out the shimano shifter mechanism which equates to big bucks in repair cost. Looking at the metal used it is no wonder it didn't last. Very poor quality. Too bad, because it is a great looking bike. I guess I'll give Wal Mart a try next.........
Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
I thought from the reviews this would be fairly sturdy rope, it wasn't, it was pretty limp. For the price I suppose i got what I paid for.
What this is is a cheap skateboard, with a cheap metal bar stuck through it, with some Dora stuff pasted on last minute.Within the first day of using this, the Dora sticky-paper they put on the bottom of the skateboard (where your child puts their feet) was torn.  Within two days, it was nearly completely destroyed.   I tried to fix this with elmer's glue, but to no avail.Now I have a 'plain' scooter...I've seen this thing on sale for less than a ten-spot, it MIGHT be worth that price, but not any more..
Nothing against these particular paddles, but avoid cheap paddles. If you splurge on any item in your kayak budget it should be the paddles. If you paddle, you will develop a close relationship with your paddles - it can either be a good one or a bad one. You can markedly improve your paddling experience with a relatively small increase in spending. Good paddles will make you want to use your kayak
To say that this mat is very slippery is an understatement. It is basically unuseable! I wound up throwing it aside the first time I tried it out. A complete waste of money
This piece is really quite over-priced for what you get, though not having the knife allows you to bring this on a plane with you.  I've seen this unit marketed elsewhere as a "travel-friendly" Swiss Army tool (not knife).Nevertheless, the unit I have is the 64MB version of:ASIN: B0002VM8ZM...which costs considerably less (~$30) on Amazon, has the same 128MB USB drive and red light as the unit on this page, plus you get a small quantity of Swiss Army tools INCLUDING a knife.  Unless you are concerned about going on a plane, I'd recommend the ASIN: B0002VM8ZM over the unit on this page.  BTW, I got my handy little 64MB unit (which I'd give four stars for if I had the option) for only $9.99 on clearance at Target.
Maybe I should read the description better, but I was disapointed to find out, when receiving it, that this is JUST a USB Key with a pen and anemic led light.No "swiss army stuff". Not even a knife. I thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have, you know, a knife? That said, the USB key is very tiny, almost too small on its own (detached from the swiss army non-knife housing), so it's good it has a "home" within the casing, otherwise it would probably go missing
very heavy easily torn--reinforcement non fucnctional--doubt i can cover my bike 10 times before it is torn to shreds--i would not reccomend it at all--wasted my mone
I live in northern California, so rain is nothing new to me.  I've been putting off getting a large umbrella for quite some time now, but since I signed up for free Amazon Prime, I figure I'd buy everything I've been wanting for 30 straight days.  This umbrella made my list because I've read some decent reviews on it, plus it's affordable but I guess you get what you pay for.  The first umbrella came and the tip was split.  I ask for a replacement from Amazon which arrived next day (nice service) however, I wish this umbrella is as good as Amazon's service, because the replacement umbrella also arrived damaged.  Except this one is far worse; the entire tip is missing.  Since this is the replacement, Amazon will only do a refund.  By the way I'm STILL without an umbrella
I've been looking for weight lifting gloves, and trying out gloves that seemed to work for me but either bled onto my hands or ripped.  These gloves, however, dried out my hands and made me use lots of moisturizers.  They also tore down the knuckles on my left hand and in between the thumbs.  Weighlifting gloves are yes supposed to keep your hands dry during work outs and to prevent calases.  These gloves dried out my hands completely and gave me calases.  If you want a good pair of gloves do not get these
It may say "Slow Cooker" on the front of the item, but I assure you, it is anything but slow! I was looking for a crock pot for camping using propane and was told this was the item for me! So, I made my Hungarian Ghoulash in it, glad that the night meal would be done in 8-10 hours when we got back from the beach. All I can say is, thank goodness my husband noticed that it was bubbling inside of the cooker a half hour later, or we wouldn't have had anything but charcoal left, had we left the campsite that day without checking it! It was cooking on low, and it was literally done in a half hour's time. So, keep in mind, if you are camping and you haven't tried using this product yet, it won't take long before your meal is done. Sadly, my crock pot recipes were put away for the rest of that trip- the campground we were at didn't have electricity, hence why I wanted a propane crock pot.
it puts out heat but not very well, maybe if it was put under a blanket in an emergency it would suffice, but by no means is it a replacment for your cars heating system.
This is the second Nike watch I ordered. The first one did not work and Isent it back to Amazon. Amazon was great and sent me new one. This one worked for a few days. I then had the battery replaced . Two weeks after it stopped working. By that time I had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen. I have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain. I am am glad I have had this opportunity to vent.In short, the watch is awful.
After ridding a only a couple of times this bike began to fall apart. The brakes were faulty to begin with which were repaired soon after purchase. While ridding on an easy trail the seat broke off half way through the ride. With out a seat I had to walk the bike back to the car. I advise extra caution for first time bikers and do a check to make sure all the components are working.   
I have an original thighmaster I purchased years ago...thinking this Thighmaster Gold was going to be similar I purchased it to take to work with me.  It is very flimsy-it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up. My old thighmaster is very sturdy-I have been using it for years and it looks fairly new.  This one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year.  Save your money
First of all I'd like to say how much I loved my Thighmaster.  I got one four months ago from a Sportmart and it has been part of my daily routine ever since. I have much better thigh muscles and a lot more confidence in myself because that little invention made of foam and an industrial strength coil. With that said, I have a slightly amusing and mildly alarming anecdote for you.I was just beginning my strength training exercises and I had just done my second rep with the Thighmaster and all of the sudden I heard a loud pop and it fell to the ground . . . IN TWO PIECES! Now there are two things that immediately crossed my mind, "Wow man, my thighs must made of STEEL!"  and the other more likely scenario "Wow man, it fell apart after four months, this must be an inferior product."  Anyway I e-mailed SuzanneSommers.com in hopes that it was a fluke and that I had gotten the one crumby thighmaster.  I asked them if it was possible to replace it, and sadly although I only owned it four months I was told " It may be time for a new thigh master as the product is not designed to last forever."   Last time I checked, four months is NOT anywhere near forever.  A year, six months maybe, but when you divide the cost of a thighmaster by the amount of time I owned it, the costs outweighs the benefits.  It is even less comforting that the company wasn't surprised or alarmed by their product's short lifespan.  It seemed that if four months is akin forever to the people at suzannesomers.com, then the product's usage expectancy is not much more than that.  It makes me unhappy to have ruined such a handy little device with normal wear and tear, but I can't really afford to buy a new one every four months.  I just wanted to give everyone a heads up and let you know that although it is theoretically a great product, the durability is highly dubious.  And the suzannesomers.com, who referred me to the manufacturer's warrantee only think that a thighmaster should work for three months maximum.
Does the unit work??,...Well yes to a degree. It takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances. The display is poor and though they say "up to 40 objects per hole" there is normally 2-4 objects per hole. All this depends upon the Skycaddie course recorder. The user (you) can not modify the course or add any objects that the  course recorder didn't think was important.Now the bad part. The unit attaches via button and belt clip (like a cell phone). My button (part that attaches to main unit) has died twice in the first 30 days. When it breaks again,...which it will often,..the unit will probally hit the dirt. This isn't good. But fear not. It will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with Skygolf. And another week to get a replacement button (which has been modified even weaker than the original one). Now my replacement broke on the first time I clipped it to the belt. Now back to Skycaddie to get another. After being on hold for another hour, they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts. This will take another hour. You then get a message to leave a message. Normally within a week someone will call you back. By normally I mean about 35% of the time you leave messages they return them. Would I buy another,... duh,.... NO
I got this POS for Christmas because I was excited by the ad, the concept, and Natalie Gulbis.  It' a neat idea and I love gadgets.  Upon removing it from the box it looks and feels cheap, like a happy meal toy cell phone.  Cheap plastic and a poor LCD screen.  If that were it, I could live with it, but I can not get this thing to connect to the website to down load the necessary software.  I have been trying all day, from different computers, and still nothing.  I call the support number, sit on hold for about fifteen minutes and then it just hangs up on you.  This is a fairly expensive toy.  You would think SkyGolf would spens a little less money on advertising and a little more on R D.  This thing is junk.  Stick with a Bushnell 1500 PinSeeker instead.  Traditional rangefinder, but it works great.  Nothing to crash, no support needed, and IT WORKS!!!  I am sending this expensive piece of junk back first t hing tomorrow.  The sad thing is, SkyGolf is destroying its image and reputation.  If they had put a little more effort into their development, and actually had someone there to answer the phones, this could have been a really nead golf tool that people wouldn't mind paying for.  The annual $20 membership fee is no problem, if it works.  Right now, I wouldn't pay $20 for the unit its self, let alone the membership.  Don't waste your money on this... well, I was going to call it an expensive paper weight, but it wouldn't even work for that... it weighs about as much as a sheet of card stock. 
The following were the problems:1. Bent fender - poor packaging2. Sratches in paint in several areas3. Three nuts were missing4. The front wheel hub had lateral play - cannot be fixedPlanning to return cycle if amazon accepts it
The cardboard shipping container for this bike was broken through and open in several places, which could have been the result of poor design of the packaging and/or inept handling by the shipping company.  A fender was bent and some of the paint was scratched.  The front brake was difficult to adjust because there did not seem to be enough wire.  A required tool, a 5mm allen wrench, was not provided. I have not attempted to adjust the gears because it seems too complicated, however, the bike seems to perform adequately as is.
As the previous reviewer said, I can see this being passable as a one player score keeper. But don't make a mistake, it's impossible to correct. If it is possible, I don't know how as there are no directions. Using it for more than one player is tedious and not practical. With the buttons the way they are, its going to get bumped and errors made. And you probably won't even know it.Just a horrible design and a waste of money
Overall the item works well.  If keeping track of one player it is just fine.  When trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player.  To play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two
this unit is amazingly heavy given that it is mostly mesh. The poles are not super high quality and I would imagine are going to break is used a lot. I used this in some high winds and the zippers broke.
Advertised as having a coaster brake, not.Advertised as having a 6 speed, not, has a 5 speed.If I would have known this, I would have opted for something else.
I bought this for my mountain bike with large suspension forks.  I tried the instructions to find the proper placement of the sensor but that was useless as it just has a picture for this part.  No recommendations for proper location.  Then I found the only way the system would register a rotation is to have the magnet touch the sensor.  So now I have an annoying clicking and am wondering when it will actualy break from the constant contact.  Going to send it bac
To describe these as "light and cheap" is exactly right.  And neither is a compliment.  My Thera-band handles started crumbling after only a few weeks of regular (3 or 4 times a week) use.  The foam rubber on the handles is obviously cheap quality and started fraying at the edges.  After picking up several chunks of foam off the floor, I learned that tying my own handles at the end of the Thera-band stretch bands works better -- and is free.These handles simply are not sturdy or well-made enough to hold up for the use they are intended for.  Save your money
The foam rubber on my handles is shredding on the edges after only ONE MONTH.  Not worth the money
My Mom wrecked badly on this the first time out, due to the difficult-to-control steering.  Very awkward handle bars...several of us tried to ride it.  My friend--a fitness pro  personal trainer--put it best by saying "That's the most uncomfortable bike I've ever ridden." Mom ended up giving it to a charity bike drive.  I hope somebody likes it. :-
If you decide to purchase this bicycle, may I offer some advice.  If your bicycle arrives missing a part, please immediately return it to the store where it was purchased.  My wife's bicycle arrived minus the front fender with bolt.  The folks at the Customer Service Department at Pacific Cycle were understanding and said that I would receive the missing parts with 10 business days.  After two weeks passed, I called again, this time the parts were on backorder.  Curious, I asked why I wasn't told that two weeks earlier.  "You have to dig down in our system", was the answer.I asked when I might receive the missing parts.  "Could be two or three more months", she replied.  When I suggested that two months was a long time, she said something I didn't expect, "You know, there's no reason that you can't ride the bicycle without the fender"
I would like to tell you my opinion of the bike, but I never even got to see it.  The company that amazon uses to ship the bike (Eagle freight) lost my bike (even with a tracking number!) They refused to admit this after several rounds of calling and waiting on hold. Even the supervisor never returned my phone call. I explained the situation to amazon and they were very helpul and offered to send out a replacement immediately, but unfortunately they would only send it by Eagle, so I took the refund.  If you want to pay a small amount for a bike, buy it here.  If you want to actually own a bike and ride it, buy it somewhere else
I've been using harbinger since mid-90's and all of them share the same problem: after a few months the begin to smell like wet rag, a recurring odor after handwash, machinewash, sun exposure. I am embarassed to use them. This particular model is in its second year of use at first, they seemed too bulky to completely clench your fist without some feeling of vascular obstruction an effect exacerbated by the rubber pieces that form the non-slippery grip; sometimes i prefered to use my basic pair without all that fancy stuff. Now that some rubber has fallen they feel better. As of now they are dismembering at the seams, they still smell bad (3-4 working sessions a week, 2 hours, good care).  I am moving to another brand hopping they will behave better maybe GoFit or Valeo or Nike. Try neoprene perhaps
impossible to get off after a good work out. just not for me
I have had very bad experiences with this company in the past.  There is absolutely no support for any repair to their products whatsoever.  If there's a problem in the first 90 days, you're fine.  After that, you're up the creek - and this is particularly true of any item with electronics in it.  As all their components are manufactured in Asia, they have no way of repairing or replacing any component of your items should anything go wrong with them in time.Be very careful with these people, as you're likely to pay a lot of money for a very pretty, non-functioning bookend
We bought this boat 4 years ago when my oldest (of three) was a baby.  I totally agree with the others who have said that it is tippy and not safe.  We only used it a couple of times because he would just pitch forward or from side to side.  We used it when he was between 5 and 9 months old and able to sit up, and still had this problem. Maybe an older, much more stable child could use it, but it is advertised for use with infants and it's just not worth the trouble of trying to balance your baby in this thing
this boat seemed like a great idea, and my 7 month baby does like it. it gets him in the water, which is fun, but i cant even take my eyes off him for one nano-second. he has fallen over the sides, he has fallen forward between the seat and tube. the seat is so small and there is so much space between it and the tube. my babys legs fit fine in the leg opening. this boat is dangerous. i am looking for a new one
I bought this boat for my son when he was 8 months old.  He liked the boat well enough...even played with it when it was sitting on dry land.  However, in the water, this boat is VERY tippy, requiring two adult hands AT ALL TIMES.  Not good if you have more than one kid and NEED that extra hand.  I bought a much sturdier boat that still of course needs constant supervision but is great and can be used for more than one summer.  I wouldn't recommend anyone put their baby in this boat
Small holes, unstable, no space for the bum. My daughter cried everytime we tried it. We had a Pool School deluxe baby float before but we left it at the pool and it dissapeared. She loved that one. I could not find it in the store so I bought the Swim School and am regretting it.Buy the Pool School!
The handle bars keep loosening up which in turn makes it very dangerous.  Also, the base metal footboard is cracking.  I wouldn't spend the money on this scooter.  It's not worth it.  Spend your money on a cheaper model Razor. 
well, first of all I ordered this product on Amazon and they sent me something completely different, they sent me roller skates with the wheels side by side instead of the roller blades I ask for like in the picture. Then when I sent an e-mail trying to exchange the product, no one returns my calls or e-mails me back, after so long of trying it's already past the 30 day exchange policy. So yeah, if you want a better review, contact me so I can exchange the product
This bed was a real disappointment from the beginning. We actually thought we had received the wrong bed because there certainly is nothing like memory foam on it. It's just a fabric cover, perhaps with an extra layer of material, but it CAN'T be foam. Maybe only 1/4" thick at most. Then, after 4 months some of the inner cells must have separated because there was a 4" rise on both the top and bottom of a cell area and it felt like more were starting to detach internally. BAD BED
The product information states that this bed has 1 inch of memory foam, they must round that number up to the closest inch because there was maybe 1/2 inch.  We didn't even bother to blow the thing up, utter junk, returned for something cheaper and better put together (we hope). if I could give this a negative star rating I would.
i paid [...] bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it works and after using it a few time si relized its flaws first its too damn small its accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crap and doenst do squat in heavy battlesand the clip is a reduiclus system of   shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystem buy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it
This is the most horrible product I have ever bought in my entire life so if you want a nice gun this is not it
First of all it took like 2 weeks for then gun to get to me. 2 weeks later....the piston broke so its not a high quality airsoft gun. But it looks cool and its worth the price
Both me and the mat slide all over the place. It has no traction whatsoever and is absolutely not suitable for anyone who does yoga on a regular basis.
There was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation.I purhased a crank puller tool for $21.44 (incl tax), a crank wrench for $18.18 (incl. tax), and grease for $6.38 to repair this brand new bicycle.Upon disassembly I found two (2) metal shavings, each about 0.25 inches in size, that appeared to be from drilling.  I have saved the two (2) metal shavings.I removed the metal shavings, cleaned and re-greased, and the clicking noise and vibration was fixed.Since this was a brand new bicycle, it would seem reasonable to reimburse me for the tools required to repair it.  The total cost, not including and labor, is $46.00.
Machine is well constructed but should have been made adjustable - also, no instructiuons were included and after having contacted the company to request instructions, I have never heard from the
The day we received the stroller we were very excited. We put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction.  However, when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow. Of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming. We have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company.  I would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time
I saw this ad on TV today and about to purchased from here at Amazon instead of zone pilates' web site. I kept reading reviews and one reviewer (Evelyn from FL) mentined that the ring would not stay on the body. Actually, I was thinking the same. I was about to purchase and saw s/h fees (about $15). Also her "Keep on looking" and I did. I found out "Everlast for Her Pilates Fitness Ring with DVD" here at amazon for only $14.99 (ASIN: B00091RYZY ) and "Bally Fitness Ring for Pilates with DVD" $17.99 (ASIN: B000H3YNR6 ). Both are very identical to this zone pilates and eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25. Sorry, my review will not be helpful for the seller of this zone pilates but maybe for actual customers, like me.PS. I have similar pilates rubber resistant ring and it doesn't stay put on the body, especially near the hip. It is good for toning my legs though. I really want the butts from the models of Zone's commercial. Maybe I can try with Everlast ring with half price.Update 1/11/07: I received my Everlast ring yesterday. The physical ring is very identical to this Zone ring but actual workouts are quite different. I really like Zone's workouts from commercial (you can also watch again from their website), especially for buns  thights. I wish I can purchase just DVD from Zone with low s/h :)Update 1/16/07: I'd also purchased this Zone Pilates from Walmart (~$25+7 s/h) and received it yesterday. It was a huge mistake! The ring is very identical to Everlast, not any better (rather slightly heavier). The accompanied DVD has only 2 workouts and they last only about 10 min. and the second workout is slightly modified from the first one. They were not as effective as Everlast's workout DVD, which is more precise and has better menu. The instructor from this Zone Pilates, Kim Stoneman, has flabby belly and sloping buttocks! It seems like she is not using her own ring unless it's not effective as advertised and she proved that! Very un-motivating for me! She stands in front of a still camera so we cannot see particular movements from different angle (unlike Everlast, you can see those). Zone Pilates advertised with a different model with pretty body but you cannot see her in the workout DVD. Don't waste your money to belive the commercial and purchase this Zone. I'll return mine to Walmart ASAP
be forwarned, that this is more for isolated toning legs, arms, shoulders.hips,  rather than pilates workout. does not strengthen the core muscles like pilates does and may weaken them.  The trainer on the dvd has flabby abs, and thick torso,  rather than long lean muscles and core muscle strength that is usually found when doing pilates workouts. i found the equipment bulky and awkward to use, hard to hold my body in good alignment and almost impossible to do the exercises from my power center, very disappointed in dvd training that accompanies the set. and serious questions about whether this routine weakens the abs, after my experience with it and seeing the condition of the abds of the trainer.  It is not up to the caliber of what I have come to expect from pilates. also feel there is risk of injury related to difficulty of holding body in correct alignment, as equipment kept slipping down or up. Need to go back to the drawing board on this one, there are better, less expensive, better made options out there, with better training. Keep on looking.
I just got mine 3 days ago. I can see that it might help toning the areas. And the video is not annoying. What is a problem is the WONDERFUL bruising on my legs where the device sits for the workout. I didn't purchase this item for weight loss, I thought it would help for toning. But the bruises, while they may go away with continued use, are not worthe the $$. I am sending mine back today. Sorry
This product is not very good. The speed registers at least 6 miles per hour faster than radar gun. Getting the grip on the ball correct to make it even register a speed is difficult and frustrating. Avoid this ball
this is marys suns review. it broke in 2 days, first the full auto went then the shooting in general. dont get i
I purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months. The resistence motor is defective which is what I have had replaced 3 times now. This motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program--upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus. The positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus. Ovewrall I cannot recommend this product.
This gun didn't work from the moment my son took it out of the box. The return shipment and restocking fee would have cost nearly the purchase price so I didn't bother. It went straight to the trash can
This gun broke in the first few used.   When I called for service, they inisted on waiting for the tech, and then the return was going to cost almost what the gun  cost.Overall...  this was a writeoff
Okay, here's the bottom line.  If you're just getting into airsoft, this could be an okay gun for backyard can shooting or whatnot.  But if you're actually looking to get into the sport competitively, look for a Classic Army or Tokyo Marui AUG.  It will be more expensive, but it will be quality.  The number one rule of the airsoft world is: You get what you pay for.  This is a cheap gun, and it's going to perform like a cheap gun.  If you're looking for a decent cheap gun, let me recommend the UTG Warhawk, UTG MP5 or some of the CYMA MP5 line
The gun broke about 7 days after my son received it and the people WOULD NOT take it back - said he'd had it too long.  I will never buy this product, nor work with this seller again.  HORRIBLE.
Graber should be ashamed of themselves for this product... This rack will scrape the paint right off your bike; the arms of the rack that fold closed pop out of place with a bike on the rack sliding your bike around; the rack itself does not stay in place despite trying bungee cords, ratchet tie-downs, etc.  This was a complete and total waste of money - AND damaged my bike.  On top of all that, it is NOT an inexpensive rack!  Save yourself aggravation and choose a different rack..
I got this Heart rate monitor and the strap was way too small so I had to order a replacement strap when I went to change the strap the battery was dead the battery lasted only 1 week.  so I had to buy 2 new batteries one for the watch and one for the chest strap and now there is a line of pixels out on the screen of the watch.  I am going to get a forerunner those seem allot better.  I was very disappointed with this my Suunto dive computer is great this HRM sucks.  
had to switch bands , standard band had patent leather look to it. scratched from day one. i can't understand why a $150 sport watch would not come with a mineral crystal face . i've had $50 nike watches that were scratch proof. after changing the band the watch is pretty functional and cool looking, but still can not replace the convenience or functionality of a mounted computer for biking
Face is made of cheap plastic - it scratched within an hour of putting it on.  Watch had about 20 scratches and dimples after 2 weeks.  I've been wearing a cheap Casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it.  Other problems include- the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly, for example when I put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat; also, the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive, with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch.  Finally, the watch is very well photographed in the ad, and doesn't look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality
Brutal, horrible instructions! No pictures! No clear, concise steps to follow.   It took 2 people to set up and just as previous reviewers mentioned, nothing fits properly.  It's very flimsy and unsteady.  I was extremely frustrated and dissapointed in this product so I returned it.  Don't waste your time and money. Spend a little more and get a better product.  
Positive: -Size, good surface area -Chipping netNegatives: -Poor instructions -Very hard to set up by yourself.  Really takes 2 people, because nothing fits tight, so as you try to get one side in, the other side pops out. -Nothing locks in.  Plastic caps to hold rear poles don't fit tightly.  The 'male' sticks that go into the 'female' section of the rear poles are not tight, so a wind from the rear pushes it over.I have had to make some modifications to this item to make it usable.  I taped some eyelets to the bottom of the rear poles and attached to ring with caribiners.  I've had to tape the caps onto the top of the rear poles and add some tape to the ends of the front pole to make it snug
I purchased this screen arbor for protective coverage outside but the material portion is hard to fit over the piping to tie it down. Next the  piping that holds the form is not at all sturdy. the first time the wind picked up, it blew the whole thing apart. So for a one time use it is okay...The money spent on this was a waste. It also looked in places like it had already been repaired. (seconds) as in 2nd class merchandise
In less than 3 months the seals didn't work because the velcrow came apart.  Everything inside gets wet.  Poor product
I never got to use the product. Upon opening, I realized the sizing details on Amazon's website was different than the one on the box. I am 5'5" and the 65cm was too big for me although Amazon states it's just my size
The reason  I gave it one star is because of how it affected my body. I am an athletic person and very agile, but this is one of the workouts that I will never do again. I have arthritis and that causes major joint pain and this workout focused all the pain unto my joints in my knees and I was in tears. I had to stop this workout about 5 minutes into it. My knees were hurting for almost 3 days after and I could hardly walk.I'm sure if you are in perfect health this might work for you, but if you have any type of arthritis or any joint pain, please stay away from the ball workout.
I agree with the previous reviews that say Hydrocoach is not accurate.  Instructions say to take deliberate sucks. Even with that, not all ounces register.  It might only register 12-16 ounces after filling the 22 ounce bottle.  I like gadgets but this $30 water bottle is not worth it.  It would have been better if you fill up the bottle and press a button when you drink all the water in it adding 22 ouonces each time
I agree with the other reviewers that the idea for this product was going in the right direction, but took a bad turn somewhere. I get lightheaded trying to suck hard enough on the straw for it to register, and even when it does it is consistently 8 to 10 ounces off the mark of what I've actually consumed. And if you're really thirsty, forget it - you'll pass out before ever getting enough fluid to quench your thirst. At $30, it's a hefty price to pay when it's much simpler to just refill a 20-ounce plastic bottle 3 times a day. Sorry to say I'll be returning my HydraCoach
I was extremely disappointed in this item.I think it is a good concept, but it doesn't work well at all.  it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it.  I tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that I drank anything.  it is awkward to drink from too.  I can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market.  not worth buying.  just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation
We found the system very hard to read. At night we couldn't see it at all to read it. Our family bought us the better model for Xmas, so we are going to put this one on ebay. Would not recommend it
I bought this compass at a Good price,thats about all I can say good for this product. The backlight is too dim plus the compass will not hold an accurate reading,I have to keep resetting it. I cannot reccommend product
The first unit was installed as directed and when it was working it was fine. The problem was it would just stop working and this was most of the time. I exchaned several e-mails with customer service rep Pat. She was extremely nice and suggested I send it back for a replacement.The second unit was installed as directed and worked flawlessly for a couple of months. It now works a bit better than the first one. Instead of stops working most of the time, this one stops working some of the time. I have decided to keep this one because of the bother and expense of shipping it back for a replacement. And who knows, the next unit may not work at all.Not a good product for Amazon to be selling. R Lockwoo
The attachment isn't textured enough to stay where I put it. As I ride the entire assembly slowly spins around the handle under my hand
I am not a big spender, but unlike a lot of things, the more money you spend, the better bike you get.  I really didn't want to spend a lot for a bike for a 5-year-old, and I wish I would have gone with my first instinct and bought one from a bike shop.  I'm so frugal that I couldn't stand the idea of paying $140 for a bike for a kid, so I got this one instead (which was actually more expensive when I bought it.)  This is a mediocre bike at best, MAYBE one step above a big box store bike, just maybe.  I wanted a simple bike that would last while, but I will be surprised if this one makes it one summer.  Paint chips easily and the white bike seat is clean for only the first few minutes out of the box.  The components seem cheap and the frame does not seem very solid.  The difference between this one and a good (expensive) bike is huge.  I had a bike shop put it together and I added a basket, so the difference between what I paid for this and what I would have paid for a good bike was about $30.  I'm kicking myself now.     
You've got a lot of ab-rollers. You need a gimmick: The product is  no better than the competition. You don't have an ad budget. What do you do?  CHARGE FOUR TIMES AS MUCH. Then just sit and wait for the 'clients' who are looking for a 'quality' product to assume that the high price actually means something
I bought mine at the same Toys R' Us Sale and had the exact same issue. Both my husband and I own Trek bikes and it wouldn't work his bike at all. It fit on mine only to find out that my heels would hit the footrest of the carrier. I woulud only recommend buying if you have the patience to install it on your bike only to find out that it won't work comfortably while you're riding. Not to mention that my two year old is very tall and he didn't look comfortable in it anyway. The free helmet is way too small for his head. We've returned it and have yet to purchase a different one yet. I think we're going to a bike shop
I bought this seat for $40 on sale at toys-r-us, since it stated it would fit "most" bikes.  I followed the directions that came with the seat, and that made it impossible to install on both bikes that I tried it on.  After several choice words and approximately 2 1/2 hours later per bike (5 hours total), I finally had this piece of crap installed, only to find out that both my and my wife's heels grinded against the footrests of the seat.  DO NOT buy this piece of crap, it is not worth any amount of money as far as i'm concerne
I was desperate for a fast way to get my youngest child to the park when my older children ride their bicycles. Unfortunately the only thing in stock anywhere was this seat. And it took me all morning to get it put together. The holes for the straps to go into were so small I had to widen them with a screwdriver and shove them through the holes with the screwdriver as well. The screws to attach the seat to the seat post of my bike were too short, and the washers needed to be pried together. Finally I was nearing the final steps, when lo and behold, I was missing a piece.  I call customer support, which is at Bell, not Fisher Price or Mattel. I was on hold for 20 minutes before I was able to speak to anyone.  Then when I spoke to the representative, she put me on hold to speak to her supervisor for another 15 minutes. This happened twice. Their solution to my missing piece? Use a zip tie, "We don't ship that piece separately."  Excuse me? You make a mistake, you fix it. Regardless of whether or not "the piece is shipped separately. Ridiculous. And at the end of the conversation, there was no apology offered, no attempt to make the situation right. Ugh.So now, I have nothing to show for my morning of effort.Also, I attempted to adjust the strap on the seat to see how it would fit my daughter. I sat her in the seat, and she BARELY fits. She is two years old, barely weighs 23 pounds, and is tiny. I have no idea how a child any bigger than her would even fit in the seat. I had hoped to use this seat for family rides for the nextfew years. That would NOT happen with this seat.So, it is going back to the store, and I am buying a Kettler Flipper, or a Bobike Maxi, or a Topeak.  I will steer clear of Bell products in the future!Oh, and to top it all off, the helmet provided with the seat has the plastic cover peeling off without me even removing it from the packaging!! Worthless.Save your time and your money, avoid this seat at all costs
I found the size range to be completely missleading. My child was just shy of 5 and weighs 42lbs. She is 42 inches tall and found herself to big for this seat. Her legs were right up against my seat and was very uncomfortable.  The bottom line if she is this uncomfortable at her age what would a 7 year old be
We bought this for our 2 year old daughter.  It was a nightmare to put together, then it did not fit.  Becareful when installing in larger mountain bikes.  We bought a 20inch frame, men's mountain mike and it was 3 inches too short of fitting.  Not worth it!!
If you search for the keyword 'Illuminator LED Flashlight', you'll find that this same item is offered from varies sources at wildly different prices. So naturally, you should just go for the lowest price, right? Not so fast...I already bought one Illuminator flashlight elsewhere (see my "Customer Images' above), and was going to order a few more as gifts. The lowest price I found here is from 'IGgFactory Handhelditems' at $7.95. But during checkout, I found out that their standard shipping and handling fee is $8.21 for just one item. The flashlight itself weights only 7 oz., but the company charges 4 lb. for shipping weight. What a rip-off!With such inflated shipping cost, you may be better off buying this item from local drug stores (such as Walgreen) for $15. At least there you can return the item easily if you're not happy with it.[Update on Jan 21, 2007]:Please check out my review for the Garrity Power Lite, where I have made a comparison betweeen it and the Illuminator. It is my opinion that the Garrity is a better flashlight.
In my opinion, this thing is flimsy and worthless.  I set it up in the doorway and it is so poorly designed that it just doesn't hold.  Once you bring the bar crashing into your forehead on your first or second chin-up, you realize that you've already thrown away your money and now it's time to throw away this product.  I ABSOLUTELY agree with the reviewer who cautions against making this product available to kids without close supervision
Took it out of the box, took 5 minutes to set it up, and propmtly ripped one of the flimsy mounting brackets off of the wall  during its first use. I definitely would not let children use this item without supervision. The bar itself is of good quality. But the brackets have to go
I've had my Suunto Advizor for 16 months. I am now in Iraq and the bezel is broken-off, like the other reviewer. I dont have my receipt. You can go to the Suunto website, but one thing you won't find there is an address with a note that says: "send your broken expensive plastic watch here and we will fix it."My G-shock, by comparison,lasted longer than I wanted it to and cost one-quarter of what the Suunto cost.So I give the Suunto one star, for being adventure-cool for a while. A lot of other Infantrymen own these, so I jumped on the bandwagon. I wish I had stuck with a regular watch and a GPS (with lensatic compass backup).  
It hasn't broken yet, but it is going to eventually.  I'm 5'10" 180lbs and these things barely support me and don't provide a stable grip.  These would be fine for a smaller woman, but thats really it-  the PVC construction isn't adequate, I thoguht they were metal when i bought htem but was obviously mistaken
This is the first review that i have done on amazon. So far i have purchased over a dozen items on Amazon and by and large i have been content/happy with all of them except this product.This product is made of a cheap hard plastic and the assembly socket for one of the bars actually cracked when it was assembled.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Shell out about five bucks more for all metal push-up bars
I held high hopes for the product - being that I live in a little apartment in NYC, I was looking forward to saving space.  The tune-up stand is little/portable, however it was not too sturdy.  The bike, while on the stand, will not withstand much torque at all.  The bike fell over many times before I gave up and purchased another bigger/more sturdy stand.  Forget about turning the crank, the slightest movement of the crank creates too much torque for the little stand and the bike falls over.  This stand would be good for LIGHT work - possibly a light tuning of the brakes or a wipe down with a rag. Any pressure whatsoever would necessitate a bracing hand on the frame of the bike.  Overall a 2/5 because it may be okay for a little person's bike or a bmx.  I used it on a men's road bike size 57.
You cannot sit upright in this chair. Bad for soccer games (why we bought it). The chair is designed to lean back. THe company is not Amazon and would not take back without more postage charges than the chair is worth. Unless you plan to sleep in this chair, it stinks
If this were an office shredder, Mon/Fri support would be OK but, hey, I have a day job and so I'd like Bowflex to be responsive at my convenience.Not so
I got one of these because it was only a penny. I used it several times with only a slight crack that I later cemented. Later I used it again, and, while cocking it back, the whole top piece just splintered into many pieces. The gun is fun for about the first few tries then it's prone to jamming up. Even though it was only a penny, it was $4.99 shipping. I'm better off getting one for about a dollar at a flea market. I'm not very satisfied, but I'm not spending 40 cents to get my 1 penny back
This gun is a VERY BAD GUN!!!!! If you  are from the ages of 6-10 i would get it but if not dont. I got 2 of these the first 1 broke rit away and the other only shoots 15 feet. trust me this gun is a piece of junk. Just poket to shipping and buy something else!!
Anything coming out of a box at Christmastime is exciting to our toddler.  Most toys, though, hold an excitement for him.  This trike lost his interest after one try.  Scuttle the trike I say, or let it become unmoved furniture in your home
I just saw this toy in Parents Magazine Sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at Target this week. I ran to get it since my [...] son is too short to use his hand-me-down red tricycle. It looked like lots of fun in the picture, however, my son is too big for it! I don't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old- no way! If it were adjustable, I'm sure he would have loved it, but just like another reviewer stated- it's just like the other ride-on toys we already own. Currently, the Scuttle Bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store. How disappointing
 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws.  Why by a gun from these guys? If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back. Want a refund? You pay a 15% restocking fee. Take a pass on Airsplat. 
I ordered this sleeping bag on 12/07/06, I chose standard shipping which is 3 to 5 days. This was more then enough time I needed to have the sleeping bag arrive before Christmas. Here it is 01/10/07, and still the sleeping bag has not arrived. My account says it was shipped on 12/11/06. When I track the item it says expected delivery date is 01/31/07. Nothing was EVER stated when I placed the order that the delivery date would be 01/31/07. Only 3 - 5 days. This is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard! I had other items placed with this order that I have received off and on out of the blue before and after Christmas. There are 3 all together that I NEVER received at ALL from TARGET. I counted on these items for Christmas and I am very disappointed with AMAZON and TARGET. I have done alot of business with Amazon and in the future I will NEVER, NEVER give any of my business to AMAZON if the order is connecrted to TARGET in any way!!!! TARGET  AMAZON deserve 0 stars for terrible service, and false advertisement!
The bottom bolt broke a week after purchase, which prevents the unit from functioning as designed; it cannot swing out of the way
Ive never done a review before because I have never been so disgusted with a product.Ive had mine a few weeks. Used it twice a week.. which equals roughly 10 uses so far. Well, just now the little knob that gets screwed in to hoold the arm in place to prevent it from swinging BROKE.. cracked right in half as I was turning it with my fingers. I didnt even put any weight into it!!Last week the nut that holds the eye hook and entire weight of the heavy bag fell off sending my bag crashing to the ground. I dont know why they wouldnt put something more permanent up there instead of a 2 cent nut.The design is terrible. Rather than have the supports and screw holes run the length of the wall studs they have then run so you  mount two in the studs two in the drywall.. unless of course you do the wood mount like another user suggested ( which is what I did ).TKO just lost me. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from them again. Seventy dollars for this CHinese made garbage. Im sure the welds will be the next thing to go. Buyer bewar
This is a nice bag with a fatal flaw.  The major zippers break very easily.  After my first bag broke within a few months, Amazon kindly provided a free replacement.  Deja vu ensued.  For a few extra dollars, Delta could use more robust zippers--they really should. 
This machine literally broke within the first 15 minutes after it had been assembled, I couldn't believe it.  My advice would be to avoid this product
I realize the price being so low that I would not receive a top of the line bike cover which is fine.  I did expect to receive a cover which would fit my brand new average size mountain bike ~ it does not.  since it does not fit over both tires, the plastic snaps that cinch it tight do not come together to make a complete unit.  I have to use clothes pins in certain areas to seal the cover in enough area to make the cover at least somewhat useable.  My tires and rims are left exposed to the elements and thus are getting mud and moisture on them when it rains.  Even the picture to the right of this review shows the cover with ample room all over the bike ~ very misleading!Very disappointed
This waterproof fanny pack is not waterproof. We tried it on two separate occasions, both times fully closing each seal, but water leaked through anyway, soaking the contents. When I tried to return the item, the seller refused to accept it, claiming that its own tests showed it was working properly. Despite what the company now says, the fact is that the item was defective. I see from the other reviews that this is not an isolated problem, and the fact that the merchant refuses to honor its return policy means that customers should be very wary of doing business with this company
We bought two fannypacks, one for ourself and one for our friends who were going with us on our trip.  We were doing  some shallow water snorkeling, no diving.  My husband wore our fanny pack which contained his wallet and our passports.  Our stuff got soaked!  Why our friends worked we and ours didn't is anybody's guess, possibly ours had a defective seal.  These fanny packs have a seal just like a food storage bag and I know some of them don't seal right!
My daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them.  She learned how to move about on them although a year later she's still quite wobbly.  The shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use. My problem is that there really is no way for her to stop. No knob brake like normal skates have, so most of the time she's pretty out of control or walking like Frankenstein. Also, the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own, so we have to dot it for her. It wasn't like that when I first bought it, though. We bought her normal skates for Christmas to replace these.
This gun is horrible. I bought this for my friend and let me tell you it was a waste of $$$. First off it is a 3/4 scale gun so it is very small and very light, if you were to drop it it would deffinitly shatter. Also the cocking system is terrible on the top there is a lever you have to pull and if pulled in the wrong spot it will snap off and then it would be useless. When we did end up shooting it the bbs wentd straight for about 5 or 10 ft then curve down, so unless you are going get within five ft of a person it is useless, even if you do get that close he wont even jump the fps is more like 270 not 370. Also the clip is an absolute pain to load first you pour all the bbs into a chamber, then you pull down a spring and shake it upsidedown fot the bbs to gome onto the front chambet then you have to release the spring and put the clip in the gun. After about 10-15 shots you have to take the clip out and repeat the process. Granted it holds 180 or so bbs you can only shoot about 15 at a time. Over all this gun STINKS. I bought it when it was originaly 100.00 but the list price was 10.00 so I thought it was going to be decent, but i was wrong. SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!!!!!
Great use for five minutes then one broke. Having use Kendo Shinai bamboo swords before I would not suggest these and only bought them as I had a $25 dollar gift certificate to get rid of
I wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country.  This retro designed, one speed, steel framed, coaster braked, comfort  bike seemed to be the ideal choice.  When it arrived, I pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it.  The first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are NOT included in the manual (which seems to cover every bike but this one). How hard could it be to write up instructions (with tool specifications)for EACH model they manufacture?  A one page flyer could have done the trick. To further complicate  matters, some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes.  It turned out that I couldn't complete the assembly, because I couldn't find a tool to handle the quick release hardware for the seat attachment.  I had to take the bike to a bike shop to complete the assembly.  Even the bike shop had problems with this bike, because there is so little clearance between the fenders and the tires.  I watched while they had to bend the sides of the back fender out by hand, so that it wouldn't rub the tire.  When I got the bike home, the first thing that I did was to adjust the seat to the correct height, and take it out for a ride.  Within 10 seconds the seat slipped all the way down.  The quick release handle can't hold the seat in place with the weight of a rider on it (I'm not that heavy).  Chrysler should have taken the retro design a step farther on this, and drilled holes in the seat stem for a rod insert to adjust the seat height.  Rather than try to dis- assemble this and box it up to return it...I will check to see if I can drill the seat stem myself to get the seat secured at a ridable height.  Its too bad they couldn't come up with a workable design for such an essential part of the bike as the seat height adjustment!  The points I do give here are for the otherwise sturdy frame, and tires that will work well for unpaved trails...when I can finally ride this. 
I saw another mini microphone it got one star, the review was telling me it was horable. If i were you I would get the maga phone one the top of the list, type in maga phone in the search and you will find the list.DO NOT GET THIS!!!!!
This thing simply does not work!I bought this prodcut for my mountain bike and I cannot even believe someone manufactures a false stuff like this. It cannot even hold the weight of my bike and bends out to side and eventually my bike falls.I tried to adjust the distance between the two archs to fit the tire width to see if I get better result but no luck.
may be okay if you take it to a climate controlled office, but not much good as an outdoors job food jar.
I just got the sword and I liked it but I thought that it was a little small. Then the sword broke from its hilt on the third day that i had it!!!!! Now you might think that I was doing careless things to it but i just swung it a few times slowly in the air and i realized that the sword wan't on there very good. After that I was just swinging it slowly around the house and it just fell off.    So don't buy the sword if you going to do ANYTHING but look at it
I bought this gloves so I wouldn't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime I went for a bag workout. One reviewer is clearly confused. They said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand. Turns out there is no metal bar in it, but instead it was plastic or something similar. Then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag I wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles. This has never happened to me before and I have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years. Yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years. Another thing I noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags. They get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them. Gave these gloves 2 stars since I liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work. But they need to be greatly improved upon.
I rarely get taken, but I did this time.  One song played 50 times.  No instructions.  Pad not in tune with TV movements.  This is going to a garage sale or charity
I used to have DDR for Xbox and when my Xbox broke on me, I decided not to spend the money on a new one. However, I missed my DDR workouts everyday so I bought this as a replacement. I should have spent the money on a new Xbox. This product is not worthy of having the name DDR on the box. Imagine a dance pad game for Atari. Then imagine it is the worst possible Atari game you have ever seen, and that would be a close description of this game. There are 50 computer generated "beeping" monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you. The rythem and the timing is off on all the songs, and the dance pad is very poor quality. It wasn't even worth the cost of the shipping to have it delivered to my home. I wish I had sent it back without opening it. Now I'm stuck with a game that even the pawn shop will not take.
This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution.  It is NOT DDR.  It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny.  My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it.  She received this for Christmas, tried it once and gave up within five minutes. She said, it says fifty songs but it plays just one.  Well, the 50 "songs" all sound the same.  They are not "radio" or "stereo" quality, rather just computer generated noise.  Totally awful.  Having tried it myself, I am very disappointed and don't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance.  Total waste of money and total false advertising.  This company should be investigated.  Believe the poor reviews and skip this product!!!! 
i bought this for my niece thinking it would be a plug and play version of the video game. this has nothing to do with the real Dance Dance Revolution game other than being a cheaply made imitation and using their name, which is not on the actual product. very disappointed!
My husband bought me this for Christmas, and we were both disappointed.  The graphics are awful, some give me a headache.  The songs are awful--they all sound alike.  Its the kind of thing you can do on a cheap keyboard.  The pad loses any sort of sensitivity very quickly.  I've had it two weeks, and already I'm hitting the arrows but its registering a miss.  I gave it two stars because my kids (ages 6 and 2) love it, but then again, they don't know any better.  I am using it to get better at DDR, but then I will invest in a better pad and game. 
Before buying DDR, I read everyone's reviews, and thought that after all of the bad reviews I might still like it.  This product really fools you, this is why:~If you've seen regular DDR you know what the pad looks like, well the dance pad and the box looks normal...untill you turn it on!~It says 50 Songs, right? Well, it's not really 50 different songs.  About 20-25 of these songs are a trick-they combine 2 songs and make it into one track.~The graphics are horrible...a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are.I wouldn't reccommend buying this...at all
the pipe is too wide to let the two plactic disks run smoothly. I could barely assemble it together because it would not fit. maybe they sent me wrong disks. I do not know but i am very dissapointed with this purchase.it does not work as well as i expected. also gofit web-page does not have the exact description of the item as it is indicated on the box that they send it packed it. waste of money...i would better buy it at the store and try it how it works
this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating.  i would recommend a different mat.cheer
I just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together, expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when I unrolled it chinks of the mat came off. Very poor quality and I'm unsaitsfied. I would not recommend getting this mat.
You can't play with this cards, all are marked and cuted...don't buy this cards.
Only about one third of the decks do not have ink makings on the backs wich makes them completely unusable
I just found one of these while climbing the stairs down at the track today.  I brought it home and looked on the net for some info about it and found these reviews.  When I read that people are losing this thing all the time, I could believe it!  LOLI'll enjoy it until it falls off and somebody else will inherit it.:
I am not very happy with my new pedometer.  It falls off all the time, the face plate comes off and I have a very hard time making it stay back on.  The spring has now broke from the clip, so the pedometer won't even clip to my pants anymore.  I have to carry it in my pocket and it is too big for that.  I am disappointed with this purchase
I bought 2. one fell off my belt and i lost it. the other does not work at all. it works even if if i shake it and the insides hit the cover from inside. maybe its broke already.i dont recommend anyone to buy it. just walk rather than buy such gizmos. that is the pilosophy i learnt from this episode
I bought this pedometer when the ratings for it were 5 stars!  Now there are all kinds of bad reviews starting in 2007.  Too bad I bought it in December.  This is a piece of junk.  I thought I was ordering a mid-priced pedometer.  (It was $12 at that time).  I agree about it not staying on, and even though I followed the calibration instructions, the steps were never accurate.  I had an additional problem in that parts of the numbers were missing on the LCD most of the time.  So is a backwards three actually an eight, was that a one or a seven, is that 5000 or 6000?  I never knew.  The only time all the lines displayed making perfect numbers was when you cleared it to 0000.  I'll probably try a 'cheapy' from Walmart.  It will probably do better than this. 
This pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking.  Those are the only good things I can say about it.  It simply does not stay on.  I, too, have had to use a safety pin to make sure I don't lose it.  Maybe I have a defective device, but this is anything but accurate.  I consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day.  One day the steps will be 5800, the next day 12800, the next day 10300.  Which is accurate?  Are any of them?  I can't rely on it.  When testing the device for accuracy in walking 50 steps, it never got it right.  Most of the time it was over the 50 steps, 2 times it was way under the 50 steps.  I would not recommend this one
This is a piece of junk.  Spring broke, constantly resets itself and after less than a month it completely gave out.  Don't waste your money
I am on something like my 5th pedometer and until recently, I didn't want to invest a lot in one.  I bought this because I thought it looked cool and was a great price.  It fell off constantly!  For a few days I would pin it to my pants but that was time comsuming and annoying, not to mention painful when the pin stuck me!  It is fairly accurate, but who cares if you are always worried about it popping off and falling to the floor?  I finally invested in an Omron that not only stays on, but has a security latch you can attach to your clothing in case it does come off it will not fall to the ground.  I also bought it on Amazon, but it was around $18.99.  It stores a week's worth of steps for you so you can track your progress.  I am in love with my new pedometer, I wish I would have invested in this one first
I received this toy as a gift for my 1-year old son. It was one of the most frustrating toys he's had. The handle requires too much strenght to press down, so he was not able to operate it alone. He could press it down only when standing up (using his body weight), but the size of the spinner made it very inconvinient to play this way: he had to lean and  crouch. The noise that the balls make is rather loud (in my consideration) and can irritate the adults after a while, too. Because my son was already walking, this static toy got very little attention. The positive features: it is made of sturdy plastic and the colors are nice and bright
The bike came in a timely fashion however it seemed to be damaged during delivery.  I returned the item for a refund
These gloves are well made leather gloves with an iron bar for good grip but they're very light and offer no support for the wrist or hand. In addition, the padding is very thin. I wouldn't recomend them for heavy bag or working with a trainer. They're probably fine for the speed bag. If you're going to use these gloves, at the very least also get yourself a pair of hand wraps or, like me, you'll probably loose some skin from your knuckles.For not very much more money, you can get gloves that offer significantly more protection
I was extremely disappointed when I received this product.  Contrary to the description, the handles are hard plastic - not "comfortable and soft" as it states on the product packaging and website.  Other than that it may be a decent product, but after only a few reps your hands will hurt and will have the design from the grips imprinted on your skin.  I've already printed the label to return to Amazon.Beware the other review of this product, the individual posted the same review for all ab wheels sold on Amazon.  Not only is it not informative, there is a good chance they have never tried the product
these really suck i shot my lil brother in the head point blank it didnt hurt i was holding him as a hostage beacuase we play that way his teamate stuck a m16 macine gun to my head I told him to back off or ill shoot I shot and the damn bb did not come out I got a big welt on my head for 5 days and got in big troble beacuse i was trying to shot the brat
These guns r the worst! one of them broke when i dropped it and the other just broke and i dont no y. they r also very weak and the accuracy is terrible! They might be ok if you are new at air soft and dont wanna use em 4 wars of anything thow
I purchased these as a replacement for some Joe Weider shorts I have had for many years that have started to wear out.I bought 3 pair of these shorts, worn 2 of them 1 time each, washed them, and they both came apart near the seam.  The seams themselves did not come apart, but the actual fabric itself split in two like a 'run' in panty hose.  The third pair is still inthe box and I have not worn it, but I figure that the same thing will happen with it as well.Also, one of the pair had one leg about an inch longer then the other leg. The one leg also fit tighter and you could tell the cut was wrong.Like I said, very poor craftsmanship and materials
The turnaround to receive the product is horrible! Product was ordered before Christmas and wasn't received until end of January
When I received the shipment, I was disappointed as all three kickboards were different sizes. when I placed the order, no where it tells that different colors kickboards are different sizes. Otherwise, I would have ordered kickboards in 'Blue' color.  The yellow and Purple kickboards are too small for me and my wife.
I was going to give this product a "3" because the trays acutally quite nice.  Just as the previous reviewer, I love handing out chips in them.  However, I re-read the name of the product, and I had to change my vote to a "1".  These chip trays are not stackable which is really frustrating, not only during game play but afterward when I'm trying to store them
I bought this band in two strengths. It is advertised as "99.998% free of soluble proteins and latex allergens" and powder free and it is neither. I used them and got a skin reaction to latex which I would not have if it was only .02 % latex.Customer service was helpful when I called.
Ninety dollars for this is unbelievable.  For less than $15 (that is less than one sixth the advertised price) someone with NO skill could make an equivalent product from pine 4x4s and 1x12s in 30 minutes or less.  It may not be "cool", but it'll get the job done.  Are you more interested in getting fit or having cool, trendy, and frivolous toys?Avoid this plastic albatross.  It will be destined for a garage sale near you within two years. Go to your local hardware store, spend half an hour and $20 (and maybe learn how to work with your hands a bit) and get what you need without supporting this craziness...or--just go for a walk for free.Save your hard-earned money
This was a very disappointing product.  Amazon delivered it in great time, but Razor is very misleading about the quality of this product.  It is too flimsy to remain upright while grinding it.  It is frustrating to be told by the Razor customer service AFTER the purchase, that it should be bolted down to the ground or bolted to a piece of plywood.  There goes the portability of it!  VERY DISAPPOINTING!
These are the short benches not the long ones that advertise on Television. The cardio video is entirely too fast. I teach aerobics twice a day and it's way too fast for a beginner even an advanced learner couldn't keep up. Also, the music is really boring. I use the benches for my own individual exercises not with the dvd
The first time I did this video I was in pain for three days. Each time I exercised to this video it got easier, but I don't have fun. I have nowhere to put the "fanny lifter" steps that I didn't realize were coming with the dvd and my boyfriend uses them as a table. If I could do it over I wouldn't buy this product, however, you will get an excellent workout. If you have more room in your house or apartment for equipment and you like an intense workout then get this video. (There is a person doing an easier workout throughout the whole video.
This sounds very stupid, I'm sure, but I can't get the battery cover off in order to put in the battery. I unscrew it with a coin as I'm told, but when I can't turn it with the coin anymore, I still can't get the darn thing open
I got the pedometer and from the start it DOES NOT WORK!!  You have to physically shake it for it to count a step!   I'm returning right away
I didn't like these at all.  The toes are too pointy and wouldn't fit.  Might be ok for younger children than stated. 
the area around the velcro has already started to fray. This was a Christmas gift so she has not had them long. I think that the quality should be better. The knee pads and elbow pads do seem to protect well
The front wheels came off the first day...Christmas Day! Very frustrating!
I will never purchase an item from BabyRide again. This canopy is MISLEADING. It said it keeps out the sun and it is made of net. The sun came right through and blinded my baby. Not only that. It is not worth the price!! You could go to a fabric store and buy the same netting for $5. Also, when I went to return the item they charged me a RESTOCKING fee which I had never heard of!!! Bad item. I ordered the Rayshade by Kiddopotamus and LOVED IT... get this one instead! 
I can do this without the system, it's simple why don't you get a pair of 20 pound dumbells and put them in the ground then do pushups..trust me it works, i do it all the time and the results are nearly similar without buying ANYTHING
I also bought this because it was the Consumer Reports "Best Buy," and I expected to get a lot of use out of it. The frame broke on my first (I weigh 175 and run about 30 miles per week) after about 1100 miles, and its replacement just died after only 350 miles. So far I've paid about a dollar a mile. I'll never buy from Schwinn again
The railings on the Schwinn 820p did not line up with the screw holes on the frame by several inches!  It was impossible to assemble.With any quality control at all, these measurements are checked on every item that leaves the factory.  Human error is then not a factor.  This is a defect that should never happen. Schwinn/Nautilus has zero quality control.  That is simply a fact of the most basic quality control standards.  You are therefore definitely taking your chances with this or any other Schwinn or Nautilus product.  With zero quality control, no telling what else can prove to be wrong.And though the warranty says "1 year on parts", the warranty then goes on to say that there will be a charge for the installation of any defective or replaced parts.  So what is the 1 year warranty on labor?  Nothing, obviously.I wish I never had purchased this product, myself
This ab wheel is simple to use. However, I haven't had the same results as the other reviewers.  The only place I have felt the workout is in my arms.  For a good ab workout, I would recommend buying an Ab Dolly or the video 8 Minute Abs.
Because you can't give negative stars, I'll give this product one star.  I bought this product instead of the AbLounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight.I'm glad this product was cheap, because it was the worst exercise machine I ever bought.  Everytime I swing on it, I feel it creak and wobble. I feel like its going to break under me each time I use it.It makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser.  I've been useing it for a few months, and all its done is make me feel akward.Don't buy this product if your plus size.  If your not plus size, go get the 210 lbs weight limited Ab Lounger Jack Knife System thing.  If your are of plus size, order THE BEAN full body (I just did)
This product is not fit for use in any circumstance.It Definately Looks Great - But thats it!The product (can't call it a gun) Broke in the first 5 hours of use, NOT COMBAT, play use with reasonalby responsible youngsters.I am Extremely Dissapointed with the quality of the product.I wrote two letters to the seller/manufacturer rep and no repsonse yet. Not surprised.My son decided to spent 20 extra dollars on his replacemnt purchase and it WAS WELL WORTH IT.   We did not repeat buy and won't.Learn from our mistake
I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.
I wish I'd read the reviews for this piece of junk before buying it.  I had the same problem many other reviewers here had: after using it for about an hour a day for less than two weeks, the cable snapped, rendering it useless.  This is just a poor quality machine, plain and simple
I bought this stepper to use when I am on the road for work.  After 3 days, 10 min/day the "PLASTIC" wheel bent out of shape and allowed the guide wire to fall off.  I replaced the wire and began again.  It was to no avail because the shape of the wheel was now distorted the wire would not stay in place and eventually the metal wire snapped.  The company, Spartan, actually replaced the entire stepper but the same thing happened.  The unit is rated for a max load of 220 lbs.  I am below that weight but it still broke.  If Spartan is serious about this product then change the plastic wheel to steel, or rework the entire mechanism.  This design flaw is totally uncalled for and easily corrected.  The rest of the construction appears to be sturdy except for this crucial part.  Since this product was manufactured in China it is easy to see that the company placed more emphasis on cost than reliabilty.  STAY AWAY!  This product was made for extremely light people, not for people who are serious about getting in shape and staying there
Amazingly, I had the exact same problem as the other reviewers.  I had mine for about 4 weeks, used it maybe 4-5 times a week, when I started to hear "snap - snap - SNAP"  The cable on it broke for me as well.  It's supposed to support up to 220 or 250 lbs or whatever it is.  I weigh 180.  I also called the company and told them what happened, and that I wanted a replacement.  I was told it was on "back order" and the cable would be sent out as soon as they get them in.  After calling back numerous times, they continued to give me the same story.  I have since returned this thing to the online store where I bought it since they were NICE ENOUGH to understand the situation, and wanted to make ammends.I have yet to receive my replacement part. Spartan Sporting Goods should be investigated THOROUGHLY!!! 
I wish the review written in January was posted before I bought this thing.  I bought this as a present and the exact thing happened.  The cable snapped after only 2 weeks of use.  The ad states it holds 250lbs, but when you get it...the item states 220, which she was still below that, but the cable snapped anyway....STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM...FAR FAR AWAY. 
This was given to me as a gift. I used it almost every day for about 1 1/2 months then a cable on it broke.It never even worked that well to begin with. I e-mailed the company for a new cable since it was covered under the warranty. They told me they had to order it from China and had no idea when it would come. They gave no apologies, they could not have cared less. EIGHT months later after I had already gotten rid of the piece of junk they sent it to me!!!!! I used it for 1 month the whole year!! How lame
I recieved umbrella from UncleSams Umbrella shop of N.Y., then returned it as it was too big. I have never recieved a refund of over $25.00. I would like to know what happened and when I will get my money back. Umbrella was picked up by UPS on 03/07/05. I can be reached at: vlb47@earthlink.net  I look forward to a resolution to this problem. Thank you,Vick
I bought a GustBuster umbrella several months ago, expecting that it'd be the last umbrella I ever needed. Wow, was that a bad decision. This "windproof" umbrella had two of the spokes break in a light wind (the weather report said the winds that day were only about 15 miles per hour). So I e-mailed the company because I remembered that it had a "lifetime guarantee." They told me that I'd have to ship it back to them (which is perfectly fine), but I'd also have to pay them $10 for their trouble. What kind of lifetime guarantee is that? For $10 or less I could buy another umbrella locally. Their product has proven that it's NOT superior and it DOESN'T live up to the claims they make for it.Don't spend all this extra money on a GustBuster because you think it'll work better. It won't. Go out and buy a normal umbrella for 1/3 or 1/4 the price of a GustBuster -- you'll probably get the same amount of use out of the normal umbrella, and you won't be paying an outrageous price for something that doesn't work the way their marketing claims
I bought these for my 6 yr old son last fall.  A couple of them have already ripped in half and the others aren't far behind.  Invest a little more and buy something that will last more than a couple of months - the vinyl doesn't
I car camp around 6 weeks a year. Every night on a different spot. I was looking for a light and sturdy table. Easy to setup and easy to pack. This table is not the right table for me. Yes it's light. That's the only good atribute I can find for this table. It's cumbersome to setup. The plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile. The end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled. It's low to the ground. I would not buy this table again, nor I would recommend anyone to buy it. I give it one star because I can't give it any lower.AlvaroSacramento, CA
The set-up was easy and the bikes were easy enough to load, but when used in a 2-in. hitch it wobbles like crazy!  I was a nervous wreck just driving across town watching our bikes sway 45 degrees on every right turn.  I had a neighbor who knows alot about bike racks look at it and he said it was assembled right, but it's just not that tight in a 2 inch hitch. 
i did not pay head to the other reveiws, and bought this bike anyway.  the first day i had it, the back fender snapped off, leaving sharp points exposed.  sadly, we had to tell our 4 year old, on his birthday, that he could not ride the bike.  so we returned it and got another one.  not more than 30 mins after getting on the new one, than the "exhaust pipes" came off, leaving a VERY sharp screw exposed, then the tire came off and the rim broke, becuase it was plastic as well. also, the vinyl on the seat started to come apart.  at this point, i had to return it, and fight to get my money back!!  it was a week after it had been delivered to the house.  i was to afraid that my kids would get hurt on this peice of junk.please do not endanger your children by purchasing this bike!
I bought this for my 43 lb, 6 year old daughter for Christmas. The BACK FENDER, MAIN BODY, HEADLIGHTS and the RIMS are made of CHEAP PLASTIC. This toy was broken on the first day she rode it. The back rim and the back fender cracked and broke making the bike useless
Our daughter got one of these for Christmas. She's taken it out twice on pavement and the rear wheel (which is make out of plastic) broke. I regret paying what I did for this one, not because of what the going price is now but because it's a piece of junk.DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP
I ordered this knowing that it would have its limitations, but I expected it to project sound at least a short distance. When we tried it out all we got was feedback. Words were not audible at all. When I contacted the seller I was told it was a novelty item only, which I think is a ridiculous answer, since even a novelty item should work a little... Maybe the one we got was broken. I didn't try again, since the seller didn't seem to think anything was wrong with it when I called, and the shipping, which was not refunded when I returned it, was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end
This item sounded great in the ad, but the only thing right in the ad is that it's pocket-sized. No one can understand what I say through it.  When the volume is turned up, the sound becomes fuzzy and incoherent. I thought this would be a great device, but no one can understand me 10 feet away, much less 200.  If you order this device, save the box it came in so you can send it back and get a refund.  WARNING: The shipping is non-refundable
This was a bitter disappointment.  One of the features we expected to get the most use from was the volume control.  However, if we raise the volume much more than a quarter of a setting, we get horrific feedback (screeching).  Nothing seems to help and when I sent a note to the manufacturer for advice, I never received an answer.  Unfortunately I'd already disposed of the packing info when we discovered the problem, so it looks like it'll hit the trash.  Save your money and don't purchase this item
This bench is a bit of a joke, unfortunately.  Having put the bench together myself, I can tell you the most flimsy part of the bench is the part you sit on:  It's particle board wrapped in thin vinyl sitting on two VERY small pieces of metal, balanced over the main structure.  I feel foolish for buying this bench.  Between the shoddy construction and the fact that the bench is supposedly rated for a MAXIMUM TOTAL WEIGHT OF 300lbs -- INCLUDING YOU AND THE WEIGHT YOU'RE LIFTING, I think it would be a mistake to purchase this.  The maximum width of this bench is only 3 feet.  It's narrow.  And small.
This bench went together quickly.  All the parts fit well and the instructions were decent.  Anyone with a simple set of tools and about a hour can handle it with no problems.  There are a few steps where a second set of hands help.  Craftsmenship of the parts themselves seems to be pretty decent.However, this bench is simply not built for much weight.  It will wobble and flex.  It doesn't feel safe at all.  If you are serious about lifting you will quickly out grow the weight capacity of this bench.  There are alot better benches out there for just a little more money
If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else
Overall, the system is useable but there are multiple areas of potential improvement. The most important area for improvement is the height of the weight bench. It is too high so there is no way to perform a traditional bench press. Second, the pegs that hold the weight bar in place are positioned where one would normally place their hands. There is no way around this other than narrowing your grip. The fly bars are awkward and tend to bang against the bench support. The lateral pull bar provides resistance through some palstic housing which I am pretty sure will wear out in a short period of time. The weight bench has basically been relegated to my off day strength work outs since it does not provide the stability and support for a vigorous weight session.
This product is actually quite small.  Even though is says mini, I still expected it to be a little bit bigger.  Also, it will not stand up with a drink bottle in it.  The seams on the bottom make it too unstable to stand alone
This will work only if you are doing work outs, while you are not doing work outs if you wear this, I don't think it would be of any help.
this item will keep drinks cold but it is fine if you have it in the car in a cup holder for long trips but if you intend it for a child to take to school it spills all over their lunch bo
It does what its supposed to do, but its made for someone 5'6" I'm 6' and not really enjoying it
Granted this was on sale for 20 bucks, it was originall 75, it's poorly made, difficult to assemble and very uncomfortable to use
The Ab Roller was a big disappointment for me. It was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts. Then , once that project was done, I was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me. As a very petite(4'11")woman  my hands barely reached the top bar, making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly. So beware shorties out there
Received the ab roller and the box contained none of the hardware necessary for assembly.  5 days after emailing the company, they reply that they are unable to send the hardware and I must return it to them before they will send out a new box.  Very frustrating- I must drive 20 miles to the nearest UPS store to return it.Wish I had just bought the thing at Walmart
This pump did not work very well for me. Must pump it with much force fast and is more of a hassle then a help. I wound up putting it away and walking my bike to a gas station instead
Didn't pump any air into the tire the first 2 "stomps" ... tried it again another day, 3rd "stomp" and the gauge went flying off. Put the gauge back on and it still doesn't work. Biggest waste of money. Never even filled one tir
WHEN I FIRST TIME USED IT,IT'S BORKEN.AND I CAN NOT RETURN OR EXCHANGE WITHOUT BO
I wanted to use this pump to pump my bike, but it never worked. It leaked. It can only used to pump up balls only. It is a piece of junk
I bought this pump and used it on three bikes, a total of 5 tires before the foot pedal bent, then broke.  If you need a pump, I suggest going to a bike store and paying for a good one.  I tried to go the inexpensive route and learned my lesson.  Bell products are cheaply made and don't last beyond a few uses.  Don't make my mistake and disappoint your kids on a Sunday when there's nothing you can do about it except to drive to the nearest gas station for air.  Stay away from this, and other "pedestrian" pumps.  Makes you wonder what a Bell helmet will look like after a spill
It only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs.  Doesn't run well over pine needles or leaves.  (Make sure to rake the yard before riding!) The acceleration in slow, the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens.  I spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing.  It stops when the child tries to make a tight turn.  All of this was on the grass-it was advertised as being rugged off-road capable, when in fact it only works on the paved driveway.  Don't hold your breath waiting on hold for live customer service person...it's been 3 days and still haven't heard!
You can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours. Forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride, because of the adapter it only charges while its on  the machine. There is no seperate battery charger.
We bought this cargo bag for a 900 mile trip from Pennsylvania to Florida. We didn't use it on the way there, but on our way home, we put two medium sized suitcases in it.  We barely made it 100 miles before the bag started coming unglued at the seams.  Fortunately (or unfortunately due to the color), we had a bright yellow roll of duct tape with us, so we were able to repair the bag as we drove.  After another 100 miles, we had to stop again and repair the bag.  We drove from Florida to Hilton Head, having to stop three times to repair the bag with the bright yellow duct tape.  From Hilton Head to Pennsylvania, the bag started to look like a nightmare of black, criss-crossed with yellow.  The last leg of our trip was nothing but a hassle, having to stop to fix the bag.  The company has a 30 day return policy, but we missed that by a day, having ordered it two weeks before our trip and being gone for two weeks, and they wouldn't even work with us on it.  
I have had this stroller for ONE day and I'm going to send it back or sell it. I am so disappointed. I was so excited for this to arrive. We set it up...instructions were a little shady here and there, and I try and adjust the seat. I have the strap pulled ALL THE WAY BACK and my two year old looks like he is almost laying down. He HATES it. He is a very happy kid and loves to ride in his stroller. He was miserable because he couldn't sit up and look around, plus the tray was at such a weird angle in relation to the seat angle that he couldn't even see the Cheerios on the tray from his angle! His Playtex sippy couldn't fit into the small hole for a drink in the kids tray, and my water fell out over and over again from the parents tray. The construction is great, the fabrics are nice....overall I could have given it five stars, but the seat positioning is SO extreme that it makes my son start to cry....that makes it a really crummy purchase. If you are wondering about which one to buy, DO not buy this one unless your kid loves looking at the sky all through your walks
The only reason I am rating this stroller a 1 is Amazon has it listed that is usable for a child up to 100 pounds.  It actually is only 50 pounds.  It is now being returned
I was very dissastisfied with the product.   The 16 inch DORA bike was a christmas gift for my youngest daughter.  We had to keep it in the box until Christmas Eve, so that she wouldn't find it.  When I started assembling it that night, we found no training wheels or SEAT.  I was very upset for obvious reasons, how do you tell a 4 yr old that Santa forgot the SEAT and training wheels for her bike
These goggles suck.  I swim an hour a day every day and not only do they scratch if a fingernail touches them, but they fog up in 5 minutes, fit terribly, are hard to adjust, and cause irritation around my eyes.  They leak water  and the different nose pieces are just a joke.  They go from tiny, a little bigger than tiny, huge, and then extra huge.  They don't fit!  What a waste of $15.  I've had similar success from goggles one can find at the grocery store.  They are only  $5, and they fog up and leak the same as these.
I love the idea of this... sleek, out of the way for transit but readily available on the road, protected when not in use.  Unfortunately,the reality is a hard to use product that does little to improve road safety.Because of the narrowness of the mirror, it's very difficult to focus on what is actually behind you with a quick glance.  Sure, if you sit there for 10 seconds you can figure it out, but I don't have that sort of time when I'm dodging through Chicago traffic!Save your money and buy the excellent Mirrcycle instead
Even though they look pretty cool, these mirrors are hard to focus, and even harder to see anything in
Uncomfortable and heavy for bar ends and useless as mirrors. As mentioned, the mirrors are of a terrible quality. To top that, they do not stay in place when adjusted
Mirrors are too small and too distorted.  The picture on the package shows a perfect reflection - as if!!  It's about as useful as taping two foil-wrapped sticks of chewing gum to your handlebars and expecting to be able to see reflections in them
Be sure you have a very flat, smooth surface for these bumper cars. There is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car. Our girls rode them in our driveway/sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway. We had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface. These are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court. 
I hate to complain too much since this is a pretty cheap item, but just to warn others - I bought this because I wanted an ab bench.  It really doesn't suit that purpose too well since it was one incline position only for abs - the other positions are just back support for working with dumbells.  The ab position is pretty weak and doesn't really work your abs as well as an abs only bench would have, plus it is a bit uncomfortable and as the other reviewer said, if you are anywhere near 6 ft tall or over, get something else.  Combined with shipping - this is a waste of almost 100 bucks here - while usable, it really won't make an impact on your workouts.  I did a few sets of situps and really don't feel the tightness I would have if I used a real bench or even just sat on the floor for that matter.  If you're on a budget, this may work if you put something under the front base to put it on a greater incline and/or do situps holding weights - and make sure you pad it with a blanket or something - the position is just too awkard.  The fact that it's a multipurpose bench takes away from it as an effective ab bench - real ab benches are ONE smooth incline, not a perpendicular seat that bends down halfway which really stretches your back a bit too much in a direction it's not supposed to bend LOL
Not what I expected.  This bench is ok for a petite woman, not suitable for a man or anyone over 5 feet tall...
From the previous reviews it seems that this product doesn't deliver any satisfaction at all. Buy instead the wrist roller manufactured by proboxinggear.I bought one eight months ago and I loved it. I use it at home and even at the gym, since it is small and very light, so it fits in my backpack taken about the same space than my gloves.The one I bought is really an excellent accessory, since is not only a Wrist exerciser, but a complete Forearm Strengthener. Simple to use, with no spring or moving or breakable parts, it looks like it will resist the hardest workouts and continuous use.With simple rolling movements and as you gradually increase resistance by adding weight plates to it you strengthen hands, wrist, forearms and upper arms. I have considerably improved wrist stability and holding power, and also feel an Increased range of motion and flexibilit
Both the original order and the attempted re-order were missing the same parts (the plate that holds the weights on the end of the rope and the nut that holds the plate on the bolt at the end of the rope) when the item arrived.  I think that this is a design flaw in the packaging
i bought this bike(in the mermaid ariel theme)for my 2 year old daughter. the manufactor's age for this bike is 1 1/2 year and up. this bike is awful. the seat is set up like it would be on a normal bike BUT, the pedals are attached to the FRONT wheel like a tricyle- which make it IMPOSSIBLE for a child to reach the pedals while sitting on the seat. my 4 year old son can reach the pedals but, he even has a hard time riding it. its truly a waste of money and if i could find the receipt, i would take it back! it was a huge disappointment-as a Christmas gift. Whoever designed this bike did not have a child in mind. there is no way a child could ride this bike comfortably even if they could reach the pedals
When I ordered the product, I kept putting on my order for a medium size. When the final paperwork was sent for delivery, it said it was being shipped and it was a small. A small was sent, instead of a med., thereforewe could not use the product. If you can take care of this matter, with a return ticket for the small one, we would appreciate it
Though I bought this boxing glove with a $20 discount, I still think it was overpriced.First, I had a hard time getting my hand into the glove and I only have medium-sized hands.  I make do with taped hands but using this glove with the "popular" Evergel hand wraps is out of the question.  (Tape's better than the Evergels anyway.)Second, on one of the gloves, the Everlast label on the elastic wrist wrap started coming off, though I'd only just started hitting a heavy bag.  It's made of this cheap plastic-like material.  (You'd think for $100, you'd get a glove with every detail of medium to high quality.)  I cutoff the hanging label entirely.Third, the product description states five distinct layers of foam are in the glove between your hand and point of contact.  With the 10 oz glove, it doesn't feel like anything special, just a thin layer of foam.  I'm not impressed with the padding.Overall, the glove is of medium to low quality.  It even looks cheap.  (The leather is less than a millimeter thick and the stitching is ordinary.)  I'll use the glove as I've already spent the money, but my next glove I think is going to be a Title Platinum.  Unfortunately, Everlast seems to have gone the way of cheap mass production and net profit at the sacrifice of it's reputation
I wanted to confirm that I had the same experience as the other dissatisfied reviewers. The Everlast Bar comes with nuts that don't fit the screws. The nuts are laced with a hard inner plastic lining that requires you to use powertools to force the screw to chisel through. I returned it for a new one, thinking that surely this was a mistake, but the replacement had the same pieces. Horrible!However, I was determined to make my purchase work, so I put it together with force. Once I had everything assembled, I found that the bar does not keep together by design; even with the screws pretty secured, the outer loops on the bar (they are supposed to serve as multi-purpose handles) can unhinge and detach from the bar, because their connection to the bar on one side is not secured by screws. That's absolutely ridiculous when this is clearly supposed to be keep you safely suspended in mid-air.Thoroughly dissatisfied. I've used the Door Gym and it's much more secure than this
First off. The knife is great. I wouldn't expect anything less from swiss army. only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75%. And since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it, I give the knife a two. Only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well. 
This machine is too easy. Even with the additional resistance bands, it's just not enough if you're an active person at all. The assisted crunch funtion is a joke and most of the moves are just as effective without the machine. I used it every day for a month (until I felt I'd gotten my money's worth)  now it collects dust. I'd sell it for $20 at this point just to get it out of my house. I see my Easy Shaper becoming a Goodwill donation in the very near future
 this gun is not good. it is a piece of crud. beginners could buy a gun thats about 100 times better from walmart for only 20 bucks. get it if your a idiot. i wish i could give it 0 star
This gun sucks!-it has the worst range out of all the ones I own. When I lob it, I can only shoot twenty feet.-fps sucks. i can shoot my hand two inches from the barrel and it doesn't hurt.-flimsy. no joke, I dropped it when I was playing, and it shattered.-accuracy is a joke. I have a walled backyard, and I was at one end. When I lobbed it, I hit the the wall once (20 ft away.) I fired it again (twice) and I hit 5 and 7 ft away from my mark.-The one "good" thing about this gun is the price. 3 dollars is not bad for this piece of dog feces
The set is fine, however the crate was completely busted up.  I will think twice before I order an item so heavy for it was not packed well at all.  I was going to try and get a refund, but I am not going to pay to have it returned.  However, if the "Powers that be" might receive this e-mail - a new crate or bag would be wonderful.  An Amazon Patron,Iri
Plastic junk.  Tried it once.  Wont try again.  Just get a piece of rope and cut it to size.  This thing is suppose to be adjustable.  Only with difficulty of yanking it through the handle.  The plastic rope does not turn properly so therefore it twists and kinks, leading you to trip over it.  Just get a piece of rope
We bought and then returned the Scuttle Bug.  It was well made and easy to snap together.  However, it was far, far too small for our 27 months old daughter - who happens to be very petite (only 25 percentile for height and weight). Her knees dragged the ground.  I think it is a cool product, but maybe for younger/smaller children.  We wound up getting a kiddio trike which is fantastic!!
Make sure that your bike is compatible with this trailer.  It doesn't work with every bike, it didn't with mine.  I called Allegro Medical several times to try and return it and they gave me a hard time about it saying I cant return it unless it is defective.  So now I have a bike trailer and a bike that don't work together and I'm out $85.00.  Horrible
This bike trailer seemed like a great deal. When I assembled it and tested it out it worked great, seemed very safe and comfortable. My daughter loved riding in it. Initially I was very happy with the product, especially for the price paid. Unfortunately after several weeks in the sun all of the white nylon straps - used for support and restraints - began detoriating and breaking. I would recommend spending a little more on a bike trailer that uses a better grade of materials
rec'd this pitchback and assembled, the cords that hold net to frame disintegrated and broke free after a short period of time. park sun was unwilling to replace or address faults. very disappointed. 
Received the order in a timely fashion however, the box was badly I mean badly damaged . It was a birthday gift for a family member . I always order early , mistake , returns are 30 days . We had the party 45 days later when we opened the box rust went on the carpet did you ever try to get rust out of off- white carpeting . To make things even worse it was missing all the hardware for putting it together . Probably fell out of the hole in the box that was there before they shipped it to me . HAPPY BIRTHDAY !!!!!! and your welcome for the carpet stain , all new things come rusty , you didn't know that 
I was attracted to the Park  Sun PB-PRO Pitchback Pro because of the large dimensions of the tubing and the hinge assembly that would allow me to easily fold the unit and place it in my garage. The first unit I recieved arrived with the box trashed and the netting, hing pieces, and hardware missing. I promptly recieved a replacement box and it contained everything I needed to assemble the unit. Unfortunately, the tolerance on the nipples and flanges of the tubing pieces varies considerably. After juggling pieces around and pushing and tugging, I ended up with two pieces that should have fit with other pieces but absolutely did not fit any of the pieces. On one vertical piece the nipple was too big and would not fit into any of the flanges; on a corner piece the recieving flange was too small to recieve any of the vertical pieces. Also, the tubing is made of rolled steel tubing, and the weld is not ground off of the interior of the tubing so that virtually all of the pieces are difficult to fit together. The packaging was insufficient as several pieces came with the paint rubbed off with rust showing through due to shifting of the contents. There was rust dust on the plastic sleves covering the tubing, particularly at the tube ends. Nice idea, poor execution.
The table is easy to put together but it is uncomfortable on your feet to use.  
This stand deserves a 0, but that wasnt an option. The engineers that designed it were smoking something wicked. It is of poor design and quality. I wouldnt take if they were givin it away. I've had it set up in my basement for a few days and I couldnt wait to take it down and return. Which I did. Pronto. Do yourself a favor. Stay away
This stand is very bad quality. Not worth investing in this stand. The speed bag platform isnt even made out of real wood. It vibrates too much! The Swivel it comes with is made out of plastic! It Sucks! Invest in a better stand like the ones from www.balazsboxing.co
I was thrilled when I received this knife. It was cute, small, and the utilities were perfect for light duty mom-emergency situations. However, after less than a month in my purse, the floral plastic cover (which in truth I thought felt pretty flimsy when I got it) had broken off one side and was cracked on the other. Sigh..
this item is horrible! It is flimsy and didn't even come with any instructions. Even though it was so cheap I feel so ripped of
The stamper broke on the very 1st ball I tried to personalize!  A little black washer fell out of mechanism, and the stamp jammed and would not stamp the golf ball
Shame on me for not reading the reviews on this product!  It is garbage.  A waste of time and money
This item is a piece of junk.  All you get is smudges and black marks.  It does not work.  Buy your balls already labeled or get a better stamper.  Just please don't buy this thing
Don't buy this.  It doesn't work.  The ink is not even at all if and when you can get it on the stamp.  I've attempted around 50 stamps (on some range balls) and not one is crisp and clear.  The stamp is either running (too much ink), or the middle letter is messed up from too little ink.Save your money, buy a sharpie pen and mark your balls with that
My son hit .515 as an 8 year old last year.  This year, he moved up a division and has struggled at around .250, even though he has a fairly nice swing.  Using this device for two weeks, he suddenly can't hit anything.  I pitched him hardballs today and he swung over the top of every one of the first 60!  The problem with this device is that the ball doesn't drop like a pitched ball, so it actually trains them to swing higher than normal.  I'll be putting this away for the season and trying to recover my son's swing and confidence.  Don't get me wrong, the kids love it.  The entire team lines up before every game and begs you to throw fastballs with it.  It's great for use around the house - just tie it to a tree and you can take swings that you couldn't otherwise.  Beware if you intend to use this for much more than casual practice and don't let it replace live pitching.  Fun-factor is a 5, but as far as a training device, I have to question its value
My daughter loves it.  You wants to practice more often now.Thank

The design of the bed is awesome.  Unfortunately it would not hold air.  There were no visible flaws.  The instructions state that the bed will need additonal air after the bed is originally used.  The bed would not hold air at all.  (I only attempted to use it in the house and checked for possible problems there 1st)I purchased another bed assuming that the 1st bed had a flaw and the second one did exactly the same thing.  I love the design but I am disappointed in the quality
This mattress has deflated on my guests since the first time I used it.  Very aggravating because it's a pain in the you-know-what to send something this large/heavy/bulky back
This was a big waste of money. The first day of use, my two guest had to pump it back up about five times throughout the night.I thought maybe it was because two people were on it. A couple of monthe later I had another guest sleep on it. He had to do the same thing. IHe ended up sleeping on the couch. He thought it was a mre comfortable sleep anyway.Again, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
The pillow top portion of the bed started leaking after few times of use
Bed is not even after few hours of sleep, Very difficult if two people are sharing the bed, when one rolls in the sleep other person wakes worse still you will get up with back pain, shoulder pain even if you manage to sleep.
Unfortunately, this product did not live up to our expectations. It did not last one full season. The bottom braces not reinforced very well.
I didn't think it was difficult to set up but it clearly isn't designed well.  The target that hangs inside the cage doesn't actually fit.   And..... the netting doesn't stop the balls.  How's that for a good product.  1 out of 5 balls rips right through the net.  Buy anything else
Difficult to set up!Netting rips far too easily...Avoid this item!Be sure to look for something that has hassle free set up and also water resistent nylon netting thats tough
The thing broke!!!  I never thought I'd  see a chain breaker tool that would break under the stress of taking apart a chain!!  And the worst part is, I only used the thing about five times
Stay away from this chain breaker. I hoped for a few uses of this breaker but instead got only half way through my first job before the handle broke and threads started to cross thread. My Nashbar one was much better quality and only slightly more expensive
I expected much better quality from Thule. As used according to the manufacturers recomendations, this bag did not even last one trip from New York to Chicago without it's interior lining cracking and completely flaking off. In addition, the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car. The contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that's not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car. This becomes a terrible distraction while driving. All in all I had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it. Opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers, they cost much more, but are worth every penny. In the end I thought I was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a Sears X-Cargo container to replace it for my return trip back.
Placed the order on 11/20, delivery was supposed to be by 12/9. On about 12/1 I contacted the company that Amazon said was the provider, Unbeatable Sale, Inc. to verify that they did have the order. Unbeatable said that it was an Amazon order, period, and gave me a number at Amazon to contact. Amazon said that Unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first. Cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at Walmart.
Before purchasing this watch, you should go to a store and take a look. This watch is HUGE. The temperature feature works fine until you wear the watch, then because of your body temp. you have no idea what the temp. is. The barometer feature is displayed in millibars, not something I am acquainted with. I could not get the compass feature to work correctly.   It took approx. 3 weeks to be delivered ( free shipping ). I returned the "watch" and purchased a TIMEX, paid for shipping, and it was at my door in 4 days and works perfectly
These stupid gloves ripped the second time i put them on my hands. I would only recommend then to someone who feels like wasting 30 bucks
Don't order this item or anything from Mercantilla Inc. The product was a different color than advertised, it was missing three important parts, without which you can't use the bench, and many of the other parts were damaged. I've never had this many problems from any of Amazon's sellers. This was supposed to be my Holiday present, but it turned out to be a real disappointment. 
Since I have received this piece of s**t I have had to call twice because parts were either damaged or not working.  You have to call several times to get through to a customer service rep and they never answer when you leave a message
I used one powerglove for a month and it was sporadic at working and then quit entirely.  Amazon sent a free replacement.  It did the same thing.  I couldn't get it to turn on, then after 8 minutes or so if it did turn on I couldn't get it to turn off.  It needs major redesigning.  I like the concept and it was comfortable but that's about all.  Barbara Baxte
I had great hope for this item after reading reviews, but found that it didn't function as described, and that the three buttons that control it are so close together that my fingers were unable to press them individually...and I have tiny hands.  It's a great idea, but needs a re-design before I could use it.
When the grill arrived, my husband put it together right away.  I am glad he did.  It was very unstable.  I would be afraid of cooking anything on it.  We packaged it back up and sent it right back
I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the "sticky" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor.
Basically, I ordered my racket on the 11 and got my racquet in 3 weeks! That was really long, especially because I upgraded my shippping. I dont' like this because the grip isn't really grippy (lol) and the strings make your hands hurt because they're kinda loose. The only thing I like about this is that it donates to breast cancer, but I really don't recommend this raquet. I bought an N-code right after I tried to use this 3 times. Very unsatisfied. This wilson doesn't live up to the wilson reputation for m

I went to Swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others.  This is the only pole they have which isn't saying much for the brand, but I found that the suggested retail is $4 lower to what Amazon is selling it for.  Just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price.  Even though Amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap.  Probably too cheap to be any good
I tried $50-$60 sets from Regent (who apparently also does Spalding), Franklin, and Sportcraft, and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets (alternately, one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance, including who pays Shipping costs).  Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads, inviting breakage. Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet's threads stripped when tightening by hand, and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened.  Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under, and they claimed their 2 " balls were 3" (if they were rounding, why don't they round their 3 5/16" balls as well?).   Franklin's stakes had different tapers, and about 1/16" different diameters.  On the personal preference front, Sportscraft's handles are grooved, Franklin's balls are, and their wickets are narrow.  Regent's colors are dull
When one trips the safety key, one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again. This action looses all the time and distance information. The Keys Fitness, who manufactures Ironman and a bunch of others, help line confirmed that this is normal for their products. I see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body
I was so happy to order this. It hasn't even been put together yet... in box for two weeks. They sent the wrong hardware with it. I emailed them 2 times and got no response. After twenty minutes of trying I finally got a human voice. She was nice and shipped the parts. They arrived today and guess what? The same wrong parts again. I can't get a response so I guess I will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together. At least I have a list from the owner's manual. Overall experience was a big fat bust
This stepper is terrible!  The bar between the steps cracked after only two months of regular use.  In addition, it is very squeaky and the monitor doesn't register anything unless you step all the way to the ground.  Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. 
Don't buy this equipment unless you have two very strong people who are expert mechanics. Other exercise equipment comes partially assembled, this just has alot of odd pieces. Complaint: 1) No "how to assemble" video as other brand names include. 2) Instruction sketches are small and diagrams are vague. 3) It took hours of painstaking trial and error to assemble, and we ended up leaving one washer out because once assembled, it cannot be diassembled. If I had known what a giant project this would be to assemble , I would never have purchased it.  This is Tony Little product is not an assembly friendly exercise machine, which Body By Jake products usually are. How much more would it have cost them to put in a a "how to" assembly video? I'll never buy a Tony Little product again. That said, it's very simple to use. Since this is the heavy duty model, it's heavy to move, and it takes up alot of space. It's a type of exercise equipment that needs its own large space. If you have a small room, think twice about this model.Millie in Californi
This sounds great in theory, being that you don't have to get under the car to drain the oil. Fantastic! But while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars, I don't quite agree. You still have to get under the car to change the oil filter, so I'd suggest saving $50 and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car, which is actually faster than using this device.
Poor workmanship. Padded handgrip area varied from 3.25 to 3.5" long. Most palms are wider than that. The cheap construction looks like it will fail within a short period of use.  Shipping them back would cost more than they're worth.

One of the worst!  The braces that secure the material and the tent together broke!  After taking it down we noticed cracks in the rods.  When I went to set it up the second time one was split end to end and another snapped.  It sits on our from curb for garbage as I write this review
This mat may have a design flow, or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up. Layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll. In the process, the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat. I suppose it's still functional, but my brand new mat looks pretty awful
this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating.  i would recommend a different mat.cheer
I just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together, expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when I unrolled it chinks of the mat came off. Very poor quality and I'm unsaitsfied. I would not recommend getting this mat.
Great feedbacks from J. Leigh.This sword is for display only.  Try swinging it around and you'll see what happens.  They should add that to the description. 
This is not a usable sword. This is for fans of the movie and to hang on the wall. There are very few swords that can be used, among these are Paul Chen's, Cold Steel's and the Last Legend stuff. Only buy this if you intend to put it on your wall because failure is not a possability it is guaranteed if you try to use this blade
First of al it is not stainless steel. It has exactly its price do not think it is too cheap...Handle is not that reliable it is like it's gonna break easily I mean don't think of any usage. It is only for decoration.
I bought this for one of my children but it is a bit heavy and too spongy, severly lacking speed.  I also bought the Stiga Champion which is lighter and faster.  I would spend $6 more and get a paddle which helps play instead of hindering it
these are not 100% plastic but they are paper please do not buy these if you think you are getting plastic cards.
Don't buy these cards. They are of very low quality. I bought 4 decks -- several cards in each deck where visibly marked. You will be better off paying a few dollars more for high-quality cards.
First off...the paint balls were two different colors and were both worng. second problem was that they blow up in your gun so easily..dont buy less you like cleanin your barrel!!
I woke up repeatedly in the night with more pain that the Plantars Faciitis was giving me for the following reasons: -The front part of the sock device is extremely narrow.  I don't have wide feet, but the pointy ends crowded by toes and caused cramps that I had to adjust for constantly.  Could never get used to it.-The strap around the ankle was too stiff and chaffed.  Took forever to find the right tightness that didn't cause my feet to swell painfully in the night while not being so loose that it moved and chafed horribly.  -Honestly, even wearing a hard plastic brace was easier for me to sleep with.A simple strap that supported the arch and wrapped over the instep has been the most effective, along with faithfully wearing the arch supports during the day.Don't waste your money
The padding is too bulky toward the knuckels. There is no padding on the fingers. The gloves are closed palm so your hands get sweatier faster. Overall these gloves are a poor excuse for grappling gloves
The Thule load bars that I actually received were only 50 inches long, and I needed the 58 inch load bars, so I really couldn't do anything with them.  It specifically said right in the title that they were the 58 inch bars, but they were not.  I even wrote amazon  back to try and right the situation, but no one contacted me, so I had to sell the bars on ebay and buy another pair that were the right length
I'll be returning right away.  Suction cup does not hold at all.  Completely useless..
This weight bench is too short and is almost impossible to use in a completely horizontal postion. You would have to be a little kid for it to work. After working along time to put it together I found neither me nor my 6'2" kid could use it effectively
On my third pair since I purchased these gloves from Amazon a few weeks ago. First pair had Velcro on the inside sewn into the seam. Very irritating, especially when holding heavy weights and having the rough Velcro dig into the palm of your hand. Medium size was smaller than advertised, shutting off the circulation to my fingers and the non slip pads on fingers were ripping off after 1 week of use! Harbinger customer service was very helpful, and sent me out a new, larger pair for free (had to return mine first). This pair shows up, and the gloves are two different colors! Blue and gray on one and blue and black on the other. Strike two for quality control! Waiting for a 3rd matching pair from Harbinger. Again, Harbinger customer service is excellent, but the quality control of these gloves is less than average
This fitness mat is thick and cushy, but I find myself having to make a lot of adjustments during my workout because it's about a foot too short. My biggest complaint is that the 'washable' cover (a major reason I selected this product) shrank to a completely unusable size when I washed it (in cold water, line dried). Now I'm left with just a piece of foam that is inconvenient to transport and somewhat uncomfortable
I was excited to purchase what I thought was a quality knife for a good price with good ergonomics, being a Ken Onion design.  What I bought was designed to sell and not to last.  The handle was textured on the sides, but the edges of the handle were far too smooth to be held safely, especially if they were to ever get a little wet.  The thumb studs have very sharp edges that will wear out pants quickly.  The spring-assist broke after two months of extremely mild, absolutely non-abusive use.The $12.00 return shipping fee plus the cost to ship it to Emerson makes the true cost of the knife about $84.00...and what if the spring breaks again?  My advice is buy another brand.P.S.  The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is the tanto blade and the fact that it can still be used as a quick-opening folder, absent the "blur."
i was JUST LOOKING at tennis rackets, on the amazon site. the next thing i get is an email to say i have agreed to purchase one.i did NOT press to conferm this order, but AMAZON kept my credit card details on record and used them.nicola bradle
I would not recommend this product unless you absolutely cannot afford to spend any more money. For around $60, you could get the "World Industries M.A.D. Balance Board" and get a much better looking and more durable product. Or you could spend around $80 and get a Bongo Board. If you really want the best and have the money for it, you could spend about $120 and get an Indo Board.The Zoomboard that I received was green and blue. Unfortunately, it looks garish, but a child may like the look of this. In addition to the garish coloring scheme, the board has a rough sandy underside. This is good because it allows the board to better grip the rolling tube. However, after a couple weeks of using it (five days each week for 30 minute sessions with my 140 lbs. frame), the tube develops craters from the sand and wears down. Then again, if you wait it out, the sand eventually will slough off of the board itself and you won't have to worry about wearing down your rolling tube. But the gripping surface will be compromised. If you try using this on a hard floor and not carpeting, the rolling tube starts to move less fluidly than before. Make sure there are no grains, pebbles, or hard materials on the surface you are practicing on because they can easily ruin your rolling tube. This may be a failing of boards that use a wood rolling tube.Overall, this board is fun, but not great quality. If you absolutely cannot afford $10 more to purchase a much better product, then buy this board and use it sparingly on a carpet to get a long life out of it.  If you can afford more, keep looking and check out the products that I mentioned above and get something that'll actually be worth your hard-earned money
I am surprised this bike has gotten good reviews; I am quite diappointed. I purchased this bike after looking at many mountain bikes and decided that this seemed to be a good buy. However, it turned out not to be so. First of all, the bike is really ugly with its white and brownish colors, though I suppose that's a personal issue.As for performance, this bike is not worth its stated price of over $200, so don't think you are getting some great deal. The suspension leaves something to be desired and it seems to be shifting funny. I am not an expert on bikes, but I'm pretty sure shifting is supposed to be a little smoother than this.Also, after about a week, I noticed a strange noise coming from the bike as I peddled. It's hard to explain... almost like something is out of place.So again, the bike is not worth this price. Perhaps if it were being sold for around $100 it would be a decent deal
I received my Stamina Products Adjustable Hyperextension Bench on March 13th of '07 and was very disappointed. There was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box. The product was scratched and parts were broken. Fortunately the bench works, but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage. The product seems to be of quality, it's just unfortunate that SPS doesn't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap
I have purchased this backpack (in black) in August and I haven't actually used it until December of '06. I was carrying around 40+ pounds in this pack hiking along the apalacian trail, and on the first day, this pack ripped. My left shoulder strap ripped off at the bottom, and I had to secure it with a square knot. The next day the right shoulder strap ripped in a different place, and I had to loop the adjustable strap around a seam on the belt.Also, I have stepped on the waist belt numerous times without thinking about it, and the flimsy peice of plastic broke. It still held, but I had to check it twice every time. I tried to pick up the handle above the straps on my fourth day hiking, and the left side of it ripped partially. Another thing that happened was that I was trying to put the heavy items at the bottom of the bag while hiking, and when I came home, I noticed that the bottom of the bag had some holes in it from when I leaned against a rock or ground to catch my breath. The bottom of this bag is nothing but fabric. This pack is nothing but a glorified backpack, not meant to hold anything more than 25-30 pounds at the most. If you want a backpack that is dependable, buy something else. If you want something cheap for a day hike or something, I suppose this pack is for you, but I'd still say that this pack is not worth it. 
Keeps the drinks chilled but not coldWhat do you expect for $20bucksWould no buy again.Would go for the more traditional fridges
It's not that bad of a product, considering how cheap it is. However I have three definite criticisms. One, it isn't very stable. When your doing dips, it's pretty wobbly. Two, the pull-up bar isn't far enough away from the crossbars, so if your body swings at all during your pull-ups, it's really easy to bash your shins on the lower crossbar. And three, the push up bars are totally usless. You can not do push ups on them with out hitting your head on the lower cross bar.
At first they kept the water out of my eyes and werecomfortable. But after 3 or 4 times they had some waterleakage. I use them for recreational swimming at theYMCA. But am already looking for another swim goggle.I hope you post this even though I gave them a poor rating.Thank you,Eileen
Usually Puzzle Mats come in 6 Pieces.You can visit Walmart and they have same type ther
I wanted to order the puzzle sports mats but they do not tell you how many you get with your order.  I also tried the company web site and could not fine info there.
I ordered several of these tables as Christmas presents, two of five arrived broken. Both of the broken tables had broken slats in the top and one also had a broken bracket on one of the legs. The tops are made out of a brittle plastic, spend more money and order a table with a metal top
These provide good protection in case of falls while inline skating.However, I've had them less than a year and the material is starting to tear and fall apart.  I am not sure how long they will last. I purchased   these to replace a  similar set I had for 9 years, which were worn, but not falling apart.  Now I wish I had not thown the old ones away.
I never received the product and had a terrible experience with Amazon trying to get my money back
The product that was delivered was defective.  The harness system was manufactured with insufficient webbing.  I contacted LaFuma and was informed that this was a recurring problem.  They sent me a mailing label to return the product free of charge and will send me a replacement in mid-April when the new model comes out.  The manufacturer was responsive; however, I was out of pocket $13.00 for a shipping box that I purchased for the mailing.  In fairness, Amazon should reimburse me for this $13.00 expense.  I did not expect to receive a defective product
The ski rack is attached to the Thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar. The old 724 had metal connectors. Making them plastic is insane. These connectors will break over time. Additionally, a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors.
It was flat after one night of sleeping.  We had to blow it up to capacity every night and would be sleeping on the ground by morning.  Also, be aware that you need an AC outlet to pump it up ... it's NOT for camping
I bought one outside Amazon, and charged it 15 hours.  My mini Maglite had more power. The battery never worked. Don't waste your money. Better pay a little more, but for something that works
Easy to use in the configurations shown. However, 3 million candlepower doesn't do you much good when the battery needs recharging after no more than 15 - 20 minutes of use
Is it squeeky? Yes. But I didn't mind. What I DID mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use. I didn't use it vigorously, and I'm only 160 lbs. I'd say avoid
I loved it the first 2 months i had it.  With out notice the cable shredded.  I called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me.  It seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it.The customer service is bad and so was the product
My husband bought this for me for Christmas after we both had looked at reviews and decided it was a great product. I used it for 5 months with no problems other than the squeaky sound everyone talks about. Then, without warning, the bolt securing the cable to the right pedal popped off. When my husband called the company, he was told that the parts (including the pedal and cable) were only guaranteed for 90 days, and the frame for 3 years. In other words, there was nothing they would do about it. When I called, they told me that they could replace the entire stepper free of charge, but I would have to pay shipping and handling. That was today, I'm still awaiting a call back from the supervisor about the s reimbursement. This gave me a great workout so I was disappointed to find out it was defective enough to break after 5 months of use by a 120 lb woman (and I only used it about 3x per week). I'm hoping that this was a fluke as only one other review in this set currently states the same problem... and I'm hoping the company has the decency to replace their defective product
I would have given this product one star, but I did get several months of use out of it before it literally melted down into a useless steaming pile of plastic.After about two weeks of use, the Electronic Mini-Stepper started creaking and groaning like it could snap at any moment. As previous reviewers have noted, the thing actually starts smelling of burning oil/plastic/metal. After two months of use, the shocks on both pedals started leaking fluid. Good thing I had a nice thick plastic mat underneath it.I owned and used the Electronic Mini-Stepper for all of four months, using it five days per week (20-25 minutes per day), before the cable secured around the pully-wheel snapped loose of its moorings. This probably occured because of the extra strain put on the cable due to decreased pressure in the defective, leaking shocks. I now own a twenty pound, forty dollar door stop.There's no reason, other than ultra-cheap construction, that a 160 pound man should be able to destroy a piece of exercise equipment like this in four months. During this time, I used nothing but normal exercise practices: smooth, even, steady steps...nothing jarring. Buyer beware on this one
My first impression is that the unit is very rugged and nice looking.  Then I tried to use it.  I mostly bought it for the altimeter and thermometer.  In the first day of use I just ran out of patience and plan to return it.Here's the problems I had with the Altitech21.	Most of the time the buttons work fine, but several times I pressed the mode button and the mode did not change.2.	When setting Declination page 25 of the manual states that you can press SET/RESET/LIGHT to reverse the digits, but as soon as you press the SET/RESET/LIGHT button the unit ends the calibration mode.3.	The temperature was stuck at 87.5 degrees for about an hour after purchase.  Finally after cycling through the mode buttons the temperature instantly dropped to 81.5 degrees.  I held the unit in front of the AC vent in the car until the car was cooled down to 70 degrees, I suspect the air coming out of the vent was actually cooler than 70 degrees.  The temperature display never budged from 81.5 degrees.4.	I constructed a rudimentary chamber and placed the Altitech2 unit and a digital thermometer in the chamber.  The digital thermometer registered 78 degrees, the Altitech2 registered 81.4 degrees.  I blasted hot air in the chamber with a hair dryer.  The digital thermometer quickly rose to 116 degrees and I turned the heat off.  The Altitech2 stayed at exactly 81.4 degrees.  After removing from the chamber the Altitech2 slowly increased to 94 degrees, went down to 92.6 degrees and stayed there for a good 5 minutes.  Despite the room temperature being about 78 degrees.5.	The compass will only stay on for 10 seconds, then the display turns off to conserve battery.  This never seems to be long enough to get a good fix while using in reference to a map.  When the display shuts down you need to press the start button again to turn on the display.  Since this button is recessed, you have to reposition your hand to press the button with your fingernail (I had to).  This moves the compass in relation to the map again and is very frustrating to have to constantly have to press the start button.  I'll stick with my 19th century compass for now.This unit might be worth keeping for me if the Altimeter is reliable, but after all the other trouble I had I did not even mess with setting up the altimeter as I had lost confidence in the device.
The band that holds the foot came loose with the whole string after two minutes of light use, I didn't even had the chance to kick with it; I excepted better quality from Everlast; too badIn addition, the bands that hold the chin are designed such that it is difficult to tighten this thing on your shin
I tried $50-$60 sets from Regent (who apparently also does Spalding), Franklin, and Sportcraft, and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets (alternately, one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance, including who pays Shipping costs).  Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads, inviting breakage. Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet's threads stripped when tightening by hand, and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened.  Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under, and they claimed their 2 " balls were 3" (if they were rounding, why don't they round their 3 5/16" balls as well?).   Franklin's stakes had different tapers, and about 1/16" different diameters.  On the personal preference front, Sportscraft's handles are grooved, Franklin's balls are, and their wickets are narrow.  Regent's colors are dull.  Rated 1 Star because sets tend to be priced by the size of the equipment, and this is too expensive for mislabeled 2 " balls
I bought one of the Brookstone mini-exercise bikes when it was still priced at $99.00 (on February 1, 2007), based on two positive reviews that were posted at that time.  Initially, I was impressed by the prompt delivery of the product but immediately discovered the bike was not factory assembled correctly.  Instead of a left- and right-hand crank arm, my exercise bike has two right hand crank arms.  This may seem trivial until you realize that the cranks are suppose to be threaded in opposite directions to prevent the pedals from coming unscrewed during use.  I contacted Brookstone Customer Service to request a replacement part (I needed two right-hand pedals) the evening I received the shipment.  I had to place follow-up calls each week for six weeks until finally receiving the replacement pedal.  When, at one point, I mentioned simply returning the exercise bike, the customer service rep. indicated that approval would be needed from higher up the food chain because--as I waited for the new part--I'd had the bike in my possession past the 30-day return policy!With the new pedal finally in place, I immediately tried out the bike and was disappointed (though, unfortunately, not surprised) that the overall construction feels very flimsy under foot.  The mini-bike is quite noisy and so far, I've found no floor surface that keeps it reliably stable during use--either on a rug or on linoleum.  As a result, I have to back it up against a desk, file cabinet, or bookcase to use.This product has been a huge disappointment and I would strongly encourage people interested in purchasing a small exercise bike to please not waste their money--even at the reduced price--on this product. 
I was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much, I thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything. But when I tried it I discovered 2 things. First off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place (which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one). And when I finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it's on it only burns about a calorie a minute. This bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance (though I only tried it for a few minutes) but definitely not for your legs
Although the pack looks OK at first glance, a seam at the top ripped the first time I used it....I'm returning it
No Risistence at All !! U might must swing your arms n legs in air..
I ordered this product for more than what its new price is on December 21, 2006 as a Christmas present for my mother. It didn't arrive until January 9th, and it arrived damaged!  We sent it back for a refund.  On February 2nd, this low-rate item arrived at our doorstep again, AFTER I checked several times by phone to make sure that my order was marked as a RETURN and not an EXCHANGE.  We decided to set it up and see if this one was better.  STILL DAMAGED in another area. I have called The Sharper Image over ten times now over a span of 2 months. I know their customer service number by heart, and I even know their direct customer service number (without having to go through the machine) by heart (call 1-888-344-5555 instead of 1-800...). Their shipment is slow and their processing is painfully slow! They've given me 3 different order numbers without telling me, so I couldn't get accurate information about my order online.  Beware of dealing with this company.  If you can, go into a Sharper Image store somewhere, take the thing out of its box to examine it, and only then consider bringing this product into your house.  One good thing is that they do give you a full refund, tax included.  At least that's what they told me by phone today.  By the way, this should be called a Foldaway Strider, not Elliptical.  It absolutely does not have the elliptical wheel or power that other more functional elliptical machines do
I am a personal trainer and I was asked by a friend to check this "elliptical" strider out for them.  I was suspicious from the price thinking that it really couldn't be an elliptical machine but checked it out anyway.  As I suspected, this is simply a glider similar to what was on infomercials years ago. Except for the Tony Little TV glider most of those 20 or more gliders that were on the market are all gone. There is a simple reason that true elliptical machines are so popular in health clubs and that there are NO gliders in health clubs. With ellipticals and treadmills users lift their legs with each stride which of course is more like the natural motion of walking and running.  This of course engages many more muscles than the gliding or swinging machines of the past. Also ellipticals have a flywheel to allow the user to add resistance while still keeping a smooth motion. I've read the other reviews of this machine and realize that certainly any movement is better compared to doing nothing.  But it is a question of time.  You could swing on one of these machines for hours and while it might be kind of fun for some people it will never come close to a true elliptical.  I'm not promoting any one brand and I have no ax to grind, except that it is somewhat annoying when companies like Sharper Image continue to intentionally mislead the public because they know it sells products. The reason elliptical machines are called "elliptical" is that the user's foot goes through an elliptical path.  Gliders just swing back and forth like a pendulum.  If you don't believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist.  This is misleading marketing and no doubt they know they are using that name to cash in on the popularity of the real ellipticals.  My advice to my friend was to save a little more money and get an elliptical. 
I read the reviews below and then went into the Sharper Image to test the product myself.  There is NO resistance what-so-ever and I simply cannot immage getting a good workout from this product. 
At first I was very happy with this stroller. I love the big wheels, the front one which swivels. The cup holders are convenient for both parent and baby. And the adjustable handle is awesome because I'm short and I can push the stroller at a comfortable height. Also it maneuvers very easily up and down curbs, steers easily even with one hand everywhere from the mall, museum, park, or on city streets. One of the biggest drawbacks for me has been the reclining seat back. There is a drawstring that you must adjust. This requires two hands and can be difficult at times if the child is fussy or uncooperative. Despite this, I still loved the stroller until recently.However, after only two months of use, my stroller will not lock. It has actually folded up on my son while pushing it. I now cannot even seem to lock it into the open position for use. I have not found any levers to snap in place to hold it open. And because the stroller folds outward, not inwards like an umbrella stroller, it actually pulls the childs body backwards when the locks give out. This is very dangerous. I am contacting the manufacturer about this defect
I have a small head and this was way too tight for me.  It pulled my hair and left me with a headache.  Plus it has a strong chemical smell that didn't go away after wearing in the pool. I tried it 3 times, thinking it might get better, but gave up and threw away. Spend a little more and get the fabric or silcon style instead
The important top hand bar is missing. The thing smells like gear grease. I can't tell if I like to use is, because it's missing parts
After unpacking and assembling the Ab Chair Deluxe, I noticed it was cheaply constructed with poor quality fastners and metal components even at the price point sold. The digital read out display lite up all 8's and blanked regagardless of the written direction input or new batteries. Every black end cap except two have fallen off due to poor fit. I still use it extensively because the principal of crunching and stretching the abdominals is very effective. Get a ab chair, just NOT this one
I wish I could write a review of this product, unfortunately I cannot because the vendor (Verdent) is dishonest. You see Amazon requires all outside vendors to ship all orders within two business days. Verdent Gifts thought they could just sidestep this little detail, not ship my order for 9 days and feed me a line of BS on top of that. Yes, I called the vendor and he told me quote " we are having a difficult time getting UPS to pick up our orders", what a crock unless you are't paying your UPS shipping bills.Anyway, to make a long story short, Amazon did try to help and is refunding my money after they tried to get Verdent gifts to make the refund, Verdent refused, so Amazon is picking up the tab...and hopefully giving the boot to Verdent Gifts in the process. Avoid a headache and hassle, steer clear of these bums (Verdent Gifts) and thier dishonest practices
I bought the chair for my mother. She really wanted the chair so that she can start working out on it. She loved it. It looks very nice, the size is alot bigger than what I thought it would be, which is a good thing. The only problem I have is that every time she uses it, one of the screws comes out and the arm comes loose. She is very disappointed with that because she's afraid to use it now. I'm not sure what can be done to rectify this problem, but it something that needs to be taken care of. Aside from that, It took a very long time for the item to come in and I'm very upset with the fact that we had to wait so long to receive it, and now she can't really even use it!
Ab Lounge seems to be made of quality materials excluding sauna Belt(import junk). Direction manual is almost useless, does not tell where certain parts go or how they are to be used. You will need to look at TV commercials,and possibly take a trip to your sports store to get an idea how this thing goes together. Their web site is no help
only heats the palm of your hand, fingers stay cold. No elements in the fingers of the glove, only heating element is in the palm of your hand.  Not worth the money,
your money could be well spent on something other than this, not any better than a regular pair of gloves you can buy at wal-mart
I wouldn't recommend this table. Some of the plastic slats that unroll to form the table top have already broken, and I've only used this table on three camping trips. Too bad, because most of my other Coleman gear has held up really well
I don't think I have ever run across a more overpriced, flimsy piece of camping gear; and for this very poorly engineered and built table to actually come from Coleman was rather a shock.  The first time I opened the box containing this table was while setting up the camp site.  Too late: the table was so delicate that the main parts that hold it together -- the leg anchors that support the equally flimsy and fragile aluminum cross pieces -- had been broken in the simple act of shipping.  I looked closer, and these main supports were made of some incredibly cheap, delicate plastic.  This thing wouldn't have lasted a day on a campsite, even if it had survived shipping!  (We placed the table in the campsite's trash dumper the next morning). Buy a lower cost table from another company -- no need to even go to a higher priced unit, since anything else would be better designed and constructed than this table. 
Continuing their recent trend of crisp-looking cards with nice borders and wonderful sub and chase sets, Topps has done very well with their 2006 line-up of cards.  The basic card design doesn't stray too far from their tried-and-true formula of having complete MLB stats for each player and a brief insightful look at each player.  These insights include quotes from players, teammates, stats from a particular time in the player's career, nickname origins, etc.  This is one thing that always set Topps apart from the pack.  The front design includes action shots of each player trimmed in a border that somewhat coincides with each team's colors.  The player's and team's name are trimmed in silver.  The back of the cards have the aforementioned stats and a nifty cartoon in the upper-right hand corner with another brief insight into the player featured on the card.With the collapse of Fleer, MLB has begun working with Topps and Upper Deck in an attempt to draw collectors back to hobby of collecting and trading baseball cards according to Athlon Sports' Baseball Preview.  One aspect of this joint venture is the distinguishing rookie card logo found on all rookie cards this season.  It will be used to remove any doubt on collectors' part as to which card is the "authentic" rookie card of each player.  You'll find cards with that logo in this set from Topps.Another fine addtion to this set is the Mantle/Bonds homerun cards.  With the scandal surrounding Bonds these days, his cards may not be worth hunting, but Mantle's cards are a wonderful find when you open a pack.  Topps has also thrown in a few autographs and relics as usual, but the real doozies here will be the "autographs" of all-stars such as John Adams and Benjamin Franklin.  Topps has inserted cards in their set this season featuring the actual signatures of each of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.  I haven't been lucky enough to snag one of them yet, but the basic Declaration cards are a nice addition to the set.With historic sigs and Mantle cards, Topps has proven that nothing is more American than baseball, Chevrolet and apple pie.A nice set to get
I have been using a Polar s610 for some time.  When everything is working it is a wonderful device.  However, it is difficult to keep it running smoothly.  For example, when I upgrade to a new computer I go through hell getting the software to work again.  Polar customer service is useless.  Most recently I have been unable to upload data from the monitor to my PC via USB for months.  I do not believe I will be able cure the problem without PURCHASING new software +  the software dose NOT include the USB connection software.  That is sold seperately.  Polar will not provide replacement software unless you purchase it on CD.  The rest of the world will provide software and upgrades to registered users online.  Bottom Line - the product is pretty good.  However in terms of user friendly Polar is a total failure.Sorry folks - why not get a Garmin 305 - I a
This bagpack is ridiculously small. Believe me it cannot even fit 1 college book. The description did not say that it is for Elementary School kids. Believe me THIS BAG IS FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS. YES !!! IT IS THAT SMALL. I'm gave it as a present to my friends cousin, who goes to the elementary school. I am not kidding. The photo is misleading. It is unbelievably small. If you buy, you'll see
The dimensions of this bookbag where not stated.  The bookbag is extremely smaller than the photo depicts. I had to pay double shipping sending it back. A big disappointment
Three days after I put this on my keyring, the two parts of the Highgear Smartlatch broke apart and I couldn't put them back together.  Then, a week later, the compass popped out of the case.  It's now in my tool drawer.  Perhaps, only mine was this fragile
Highhgear is supposed to be in the outdoor and active gear business, which one would assume involves some knowledge about how outdoor and active gear works.  So what do they do with this item?  They sell it with a ferrous metal split ring on the compass -- so that the thing will never point to north correctly as long as that ring is attached to the compass.  (This leads to the problem noted by an earlier reviewer.)I bought this model to replace a previous version (no clock) -- the battery had run down and there was no way to replace it.  Which brings up another point:  Why an alkaline battery instead of lithium.  Dumb.  But even more strange is that the earlier version had non-ferrous split rings and the compass worked fine -- so Highgear is not even maintaining the QC they had a year or two ago.Also, at least one of the buttons on my sample is pretty dodgy.  S1 - by which you set time, date, etc. -- does not work well.  Sometims it ignores input, and other times it registers two hits with one press.All together, this product is the result of very poor design and manufacturing specifications, and/or very poor quality control.  Please don't expect to much functionality from this product
i cant say anything for the other things, but the compass does not work at all.  North is always changing and if you move it to see if north will remain the same, north does does not.    i was looking for a simple, compass keychain.  this is small and a keychain, but a compass that works it is not.
I enjoy the elliptical.. i really do, especially when I first received the box. It had NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL!!! how da heck do you expect someone to put this together!
No where does Amazon say in their description, that this comes completely disassembled!  I have purchased other exercise equipment and you usually have to put on a handle bar or stabilizer.  So here it sits in it's box like a big paper weight in the middle of my floor.  Amazon is not paying for return shipping and I can not afford to spend half the amount of the purchase to return it.  Buy your big purchases from someone who has a unconditional paid return policy.  This may be a good machine, but I will never find out.   
This is completely junk.  Don't buy it.  It colapsed in a 5 mph wind (with out the sides attached)
When the scope arrived, it came slightly cracked on the end you look through, which wasn't a good start. Then, when i looked through, there was no magnification, just small red crosshairs. If you are looking for a functioning scope, DO NOT BUY THIS SCOPE. But if ur looking to decorate your gun, then this looks pretty cool on it
 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.
This product is ineffective. The snorkel gets stuck, either open so that water pours in while you're trying to breathe, or stuck shut so you cannot take a breath of air while under water. It's is very distressing when you're out in deep water snorkelling and the breathing tube fails to perform! I often take in mouthfuls of water, or worse; suck for a breath of air and get nothing! It is therefore useless, I stopped using the tube as it is more trouble than good.I bought two sets, one for my partner and one for myself, and they both fail to perform. The mask on one set broke after 2 months (the metal pin became dislodged) and the tightening clips on the flippers frequently fall off while trying to tighten them to your feet. The bag's zippers rusted not long after use... given that most people snorkel in salt water, you think they would have considered rust proofing the metal. Overall the quality of these not-so-cheap kits are embarrassingly bad. We both felt awkward snorkeling with them, and sometimes I even felt they were hazardous. We tossed these products and bought Cressi brand gear. It has changed our underwater experience
I wanted a high quality yoga mat that was long in length because I am a tall person.  I thought I had picked the perfect mat when I ordered this one.  I didn't have a problem with the length (although it smelled that new plastic stench) but I did have a problem with the weight.  This mat is HEAVY!  I knew it would be HEAVY when I purchased it and being a person in somewhat good shape I didn't think I would mind it but I didn't realize that it would be cumbersome.  The last straw that made me want to return it was when I was in a yoga class; sweating and I began to slip on the mat.  If I am going to spend this amount of money on a yoga mat I don't want any problems.  To Amazon's credit I was able to return it and they paid for postage.  If I would have had to pay for the return postage myself it would have cost a lot because of how HEAVY it is but I would have paid it anyway (that should tell you how much I didn't like it).  I am now looking for a long mat but lighter and toxic free.  I want something that will be biodegradable.  The problem now is there are so many mats available (too many choices can be just as frustrating as too few). 
I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the "sticky" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor.
I just came accross this ad, and thought to say something about the price of this item.  Please be aware that many other merchants sell this product for about half the price. 
bought this machine, based on the reviews on Amazon. It was okay at first. I workout regularly with tapes, outdoors activities and started using the machine twice a week. By the 3rd week it started to make noises as if the wheel was rubbing against the plastic cover of the chain. We tried to see if we can fix it, but it didn't work. I can't use it anymore, mainly because the wheel is not rotating properly and rubber/plastic is rubbing against each other somewhere. You get what you paid for!!! Now I'm looking to invest in something more sturdy. If you exercise once every month this is the machine for you!
This was a horrible product, it was difficult to manuever and control. It did nothing but immediately cause my arms, shoulders and wrists to hurt. I felt absolutely nothing at all in the target area, my stomach. Not even a little. It was boring and pointless to bother.This machine was a waste of time to ship back and forth and I do not recomend it to anyone who wants to work their stomach muscles. Its a misleading product and very uncomfortable on the back also. It hurt my spine to bend in the way they said. I felt the machine digging into my spine. I was so focused on the pain and the pain in my arms I could not continue for more than 5 minutes at a time. Dont waste your time buying this product. Its expensive and not worth it.
This is another fly by night workout machine that looks great in the pictures and on videos but when you take it out of the box, you realize that it is poorly and cheaply constructed. I own a ton of excerise equipment and this is the only piece of equipment I have had to return...I have purchased so much on the internet this past year and have been very happy with all of my products. That is until I purchased this Ab-Doer which was a TOTAL waste of time and money. The tension on the arms of the unit is way too flimsy and loose...The foam around the arms is also very cheap foam in fact my daughter used it "once" and there was already a small chunk of foam that came off the unit...She does not even have long nails...The bars that connect the seat to the bottom of the unit stay in place ok when your on it, but they do not lock in the base when your not on it so if you pick-up the unit to move it, it collapses... What's really bad is the so called back massager that is located on the main area of the center stem. It does nothing but hurt your back and is worthless...Even adjusting the bar for different heights is a joke...It's a screw, not a quick disconnect... This is one of those products that make a ton of money by mass advertising but will quickly fad out fast unless there are MAJOR changes done to this unit...It's sad when you watch some of those excercise info-mercials that have all these people with great bodies that may be fooling you into believing that the products really work...I couldn't find any reviews on these until now...I will never again buy a product without reading reviews from the customer themselves. We are the best source of honesty on the market...Save your money or just do some sit-ups and leg raises if you can...They work SOOOOO MUCH BETTER than this product !!! If you do some searching, you will see some of the BAD reviews about this product that are coming in...Based on Amazon's review rules, I cannot list where I read them from...Have a Great day everyone !!! 
Well the arm rests will not stay in their holsters.. they flop around so you cannot get maximum impact from the machine.  i am totaly disappointed with this machine
Even if the electronic ball return had been included with this product (as described), I still would have returned the item.  The mat was very lightweight with many folds in it so it wasn't really suitable for the intended purpose
I bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning. I had to order another inner tube. Then on the third day of trying to use this stroller, the front wheel completely bent. What a piece of garbage. I only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all I was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb. The other thing I didn't like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang/put a diaper bag. I sent this stroller back and bought a MacLaren double stroller
This is my third heart rate monitor. I purchased this one because the battery died in my last HR watch. I thought I could replace the battery, but when I tried to replace it, I broke it. Oh well. . . Anyway, I purchased the Reebok Fitness HR Watch because it was on sale (50% off retail). I couldn't find any reviews on it so I "rolled the dice." With my two previous HR watches, it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions. With the Reebok HR watch, I had to read the instructions a couple of times. After a couple of training sessions, I began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings. There are a few PROS on the Reebok HR watch: (1) The chest heart rate strap will work with Precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors.(2) The chest heart rate strap's battery is easily replaced. (I don't know about the watch.) (3) It has a lot of features that you'll find in higher priced HR watches. Now, the CONS: (1) The heart rate reading is much too small if you're near-sighted or need reading glasses. (2) The shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it's difficult to read the small heart rate reading. In conclusion, because the heart rate reading is too small and there's a glare, I can't read the watch unless I slow down, steady my arm, and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare. Because of this, I'm disappointed with this watch. If you've got good eyesight, you can add 1-star
I have used a few different brands of Stevia liquid.  This is defiantly a sub par version as evidenced by the additions of glycerin and water in the product.  I would recommend using a different brand that has neither
The suggested 1 to 2 drops doesn't sweeten and more makes coffee bitter
I bought this ear plugs, are uncomfortable, my ears hurt, and in the first use, just fall down I just prefered the ones who are made of pvc, are better
The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it
Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
I went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers.  I really didn't know which one to buy so I bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so I thought it was better somehow.  Even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging, it doesn't actually display it.  It only uses it to calculate the distance that you've walked.  I was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked.  I got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket.  I'm just going to buy another pedometer.  One that displays the steps walked and has a cover
The idea behind this propane stove and grill is fantastic. You have a regular burner, and a small grill at the same time. The execution, however, leaves a lot to be desired.Fit and finish in this product are extremely poor. Out of the box, paint was flaking, and various pieces required adjustments with pliers just to make them fit. The igniter mechanism on my unit worked very well for the grill part but very badly for the burner part.The grill plate is aluminum with some kind of coating that already had scratches when I received the unit.Reading other reviews I can't help but wonder if there are two different grills sold under the same stock keeping unit number: the bad kind and the good kind. If so unfortunately mine is of the bad variety.
I had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months! I live on a sailboat and I used it every day; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience. The burner did not simmer well (the flame kept creeping back up) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died. It seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly. I called Century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be. Hmmmm. I did not think it would last long but I liked it so much that when it died I tried out another one. This one was immediately defective and I took it back. Neither Century nor Coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more. Camp Chef may be a better, though much more expensive, choice for a person who does a lot of camping
It is unfortunate to have to write such a review, but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that I am compelled to do so. The unit was received new, but the hinges were already rusted, the closure hasp broken (poorly designed and executed), the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp. Made in China, this stove demonstrates no attention to detail, quality control or materials.  I own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory, much less, off the design table.  Further, the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor, if not downright unacceptable (in major ways).  As this unit was new in the box, I can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the US manufacturer has for customers. Save yourself cut hands and returns, buy another brand
Beware!!! These balls are extremely hard.  They are like hitting bricks.  I bought them because of the name, Penn. I bought a new ball machine and bought two buckets of Penn pressureless balls.  After 30 minutes of play they broke my racket, my hand hurt and my arm hurt.  I am now trying to return these bricks, I mean balls to SwingSomeWhere.  I'll let you know how it goes

... and buy a GPS instead. I agree with previous reviewer (Dave57), I WOULD NEVER BUY A SUUNTO AGAIN. Worst than Dave, I simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my Vector was full of water, couldn't even tell the time. I send it to Suunto Finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and "kindly" offered a repair for 140 Euros.
I had a Suunto for 10 months. The face scratched VERY easily which was disappointing. However the worst thing is after swimming in a pool that I could stand up in the watch FILLED with water and died. On returning to Suunto they refused to fix it under warrantee because swimming is not covered ! They say the forces created by swimming are to much for this watch and it was never designed for this purpose, despite the sales literature saying it is water proof to 100m. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER SUUNTO PRODUCT. Whatsmore the shop I bought it from say they have lots returned for the same reason and non of them were fixed under warranty either. It is also very difficult to use and you cannot hear the alarm at all
A hammock hanging kit is a piece of rope! Doh
like most weight loss product these were a wate of money.on the plus side they did a fair job a suppressing my appitite but I did not lose even an ounce.No side effects either no head aches or shakes.
I bought this for my 8 year old to practice hitting. Although well built, it is poorly designed. The place where the Hit a Way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs. The cables on the Hit a Way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the 2nd hit. You might get one or two hits in before it is unusable. A GIANT waste of money. The only reason I give it 2 stars is the construction is solid
I recently purchased a Bean round zafu and I find it didnt live up to the claims in the least.This zafu came shipped to me with over a pound less filling than advertised (wich wouldnt matter if the cover wasnt made so big to hold much more hulls than it came with). First thing I thought after pulling this cushion out of the box was; this thing seems nothing like the pictures. It's saggy and about half the height of all the images I've seen of it. Not to mention once you sit on it you feel all the hulls displace to give you only about 2 inches or less of lift (I weigh about 160 pounds so I dont think that weight is the problem). I'm very dissapointed in this product.The reason I bought this was not only for the reasonable price but I thought Bean seemed like a quality company. I payed $40 for this wich does seem reasonable. It does "SEEM" reasonable. That is till you tack on the extra 11 or 12 bucks for a pound of organic hulls to fill it to the level it was advertised at.I bought this Product from The Comfort Store. Their probably the only internet company; along with Bean of course, I will never buy from again. Unless I learn more forgiveness meditating on my rolled up towel waiting for my extra hulls
The shipping for this product cost more than the product itself.  It was packaged in a medium sized box and would have fit easily into a small padded envelope. 
I was thrilled to find that a reasonably priced rechargeable bike light exists. I avoid throw away battery items like some avoid taxes. We have too much toxic stuff in our landfills already an I refuse to add to the this insanity. However, to my great disappointment, the internal workings of the light seem to burn out before ever recharging properly and before the the green light goes on to indicate a full charge. Then the light ceases to function at all. Amazon was great in sending a replacement TWO times, yet the same problem persisted. I checked with BELL too to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong and I wasn't. This light is a great idea, albeit with some definate glitches that need to be worked out by Bell. The two stars are for the great idea
Really, folks, spend the money on a gym membership, go outside and play with your dog, play soccer with your kids, or spend time in the afternoons working in the yard or the house after warming up with slow movements and a power walk.  Be reasonable.  Just remain aware of how your body feels, know your limits (i.e. knees, back, elbows) and don't over do it!  It takes time to find your own approach to weight/figure management.  You can do it your own way.  You don't need this thing AT ALL.    This product will NOT bring you any satisfaction.  you'll only feel stupid for getting sucked into the infomercial and wasting time when you could've been watching Saturday morning cartoons!!!In the infomercial it shows you "all the machines" you have to use at the gym.  Well, there's a reason people use them- becuase their tried and true.  Those machines, well worth the cost of a membership, guide the user in producing precision movements.  THey cost thousands of dollars and are built to be absolutely sturdy.  You're better off using machines at the gym(hey, don't forget the YMCA), varying your cardio between outdoor and indoor exercise, and throwing in consistant measures of Pilates and Yoga, if you want to "change your body."This is just another stupid product, we've seen them come and go for years.  It won't be around long, folks...Disappoint will occur, and the probabilty that injury will occur is well within the realm of possibility.
the radio has no presets so you have to manually click through radio stations til you find the one you want. the clips breaks off easily. the pedometer just stops working. mine stopped working after 1 month, i returned for a new one which stopped working in 2 weeks. don't bother buying cause it won't last long enough to be worth it
The Sportline 353 Talking Pedometer works ok as a pedometer and as an FM radio, but it has 2 issues.The Good: The talking part of this pedometer can be turned off or on. It is nice to hear when you are rolling along, "9000 steps." The FM radio is very elementary, but functional. There is no dial to tune. You push a button and it rolls to the next station. There is a volume control on the earphones. The pedometer uses AAA batteries that can be purchased anywhere.  The Bad: The pedometer was constantly slipping off my waistband and bouncing on the floor. It didn't break, but it was very annoying. Several times it popped off w/o me knowing and I left it in a restaurant or in a friend's car. The Ugly: If I accidentally bumped the reset button  - on the kitchen counter or on the arm of a chair - the pedometer lost the day's count and went back to zero. The pedometer does not have a memory feature - so the tally is lost. This would sometimes happen 2-3 times a day. Very frustrating. The clip broke after about 3 months -- so I retired it. I bought a Omron HJ112 Premium Pedometer and have been very pleased with it. It has a teather so if the clip slips off my waistband, the pedometer dangles -- it does not bounce on the floor. It has a 7-day memory feature and automatically resets at midnight. It has a clock. It uses a button battery. It does not have a radio and it doesn't talk, but it works and works well. The Sportline would be good if it had a teather, a clip that didn't break so easily, and a reset button that could not be pushed accidentally.
    I emailed Skycaddie "contact us" the day after I bought a SG4 to ask for help. I have received no response in 3 weeks.I played today with it for the first time. A guy I was playing with today also had a SG4. Neither of us could get a distance reading despite the indicator saying we had a strong GPS signal. All we got was "999" or complete blanks.He has played with it four times and said it worked ok twice and didn't work twice.It looks GREAT on TV. It is a real pity that my unit didn't work today.I plan on returning it this week
I have had two of these units (SG2 and an SG4) and all I can say is "don't believe the hype".  While the units are an unbelievable concept on TV and work (NOTE: WHEN THEY WORK) great, the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by Skygolf is, by itself, sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena.Just to relay my experience (and keep in mind I have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set-up these units), it took almost six hours on the phone to set-up my original SG2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software (ie-endless restarts).When the SG2 was stolen at an event, I purchased an SG4 to obtain the next generation of the product.  Since the January 2, 2007, purchase date, I have been on the phone with no less than eight customer service representatives for a total amount of time approaching ten hours (including one Saturday morning, prior to a Sunday event, when they requested I attend a conference call regarding my unit at 5AM (NO, that is not a typing error on my part!) California time).  I have purchased/received (Skygolf sent me one unit from their headquarters out of desperation) and returned three SG4s at various points in the process to ensure that the units were not damaged.  I have attempted to download the software and access the website via the SG4 on five different computers and EVERY SINGLE SERVICE PACK OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000.  Even after I forwarded Skygolf the computer log to show them the problem (software error) neither the software developers nor the customer service department could figure out what was wrong and the units were never operational.At this point, all I can say is what a complete and utter waste of time this process has been and how frustrating (to echo another review) it is to deal with the people behind the product.No product, no matter how fabulous in concept, is worth this level of incompetence during set-up and operation.Good luck to you if you purchase the product.  I hope your experience is better than mine.
All this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres.  I can't think of anything else I have ever bought that was as completely useless as this. It is a toy, pretending to be an air pump.  The nonfunctional lever on the top (mentioned by other reviewers) indicates that it was designed as a toy.  I'm just happy I was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway, not out on a trail.  In the past, I have bought a number of Bell products, including motorcycle helmets.  I now shudder to think what might have happened if I had put one of them to the test
This pump comes with a hose and needle for blowing up balls.  But there's no way to attach it securely to the pump! The instructions are completely useless.  Does not deserve the one star
IT is amazing to me how something like this could even be approved for the market - This pump is 100% JUNK.  SO Bad, that I am finding my self actually writing a review about a bicycle pump.  The instructions were a disaster.... and why would I need to look at instructions for a pump? - Well, that is because it does not work, and I mean does not work at all!  The lever on the side is a total gimmick (does nothing as the previous review states).  Save your money here - Do NOT buy this pump. 
I carried this pump on my bike because is small, light and looks good.  But when I had a flat the pump was usless and left me stranded on the highway. This is one of several Bell products I've been dissatisfied with
I got this because it was cheap, but since it doesn't work and I have to get another, I didn't really save any money.  The lever on top that looks like the lever on other hand pumps actually does nothing.  It's completely fake: nothing inside moves when you move it, and it certainly does not help grab on to the valve. It's just something you can play with while you're waiting for someone with a decent pump to come help you.  I did just manage to get air into a fully inflated tire.  With a flat tire, I couldn't keep a solid enough contact with the valve to get air in. 
During the time I was considering buying this model, I happen to see the same thing at a local department store; so I bought it. I couldn't wait to take it back.I wasn't impressed with the cheap plastic. The pump came with the adapter pre set for a Schrader valve; my tires are Presta. The blister pack says it can be used for both and indicates all one has to do is to take off the "round end", remove and reverse the plastic adapter, re insert and then screw on the cap [tight as per the label]. Seemed simple enough, so, I took off the cap, took out the plastic insert [I noticed it is in 2 parts], reversed and re inserted and then replaced the cap. When I put the end on the Presta valve and then pressed down on the "thumb part", I couldn't help but notice that the plastic would not grab the valve, but was loose. So I decided to change back to the Schrader type [and use my adapter valve]; maybe this would be a tighter fit. So, I took off the cap, and tried to remove the insert, but only one part of it came out; the parts separated; I could not remove the "bottom" half. I was not going to force it out. I put the parts back together, re inserted them into the blister pack and returned it. No thanks !!!I gave this product 1 star only because of the way this review process is set up; it doesn't deserve any star or any consideration for purchase
The gloves we got do not get warmer with use of the batter
Scary looking but inpractical.  The wooden handle it too thick unless you already have extra large hands already (if your fists are that big you don't need claws).  The talon shaped blades are sharp but can't dig in, they can only scratch.  They even have a hard time cutting through multiple layers of cardboard.  Nice wall decor but nothing more
I bought this watch because I wanted an altimeter but needed to return it because of its size. It is HUGE - looked like I had a clock on my wrist. Take into consideration
Two Amazon's statements about this product were absolutely misleading:1. "Usually ships in 24 hours". It actually took 1 week to ship it.2. When I finally received the package it turned out that the watch didn't have "leather band". The band was made of artificial materials (nylon and rubber) or something like that.I will have to return it
I have had two of these units (SG2 and an SG4) and all I can say is "don't believe the hype".  While the units are an unbelievable concept on TV and work (NOTE: WHEN THEY WORK) great, the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by Skygolf is, by itself, sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena.Just to relay my experience (and keep in mind I have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set-up these units), it took almost six hours on the phone to set-up my original SG2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software (ie-endless restarts).When the SG2 was stolen at an event, I purchased an SG4 to obtain the next generation of the product.

It's not very accurate because the sleep function sometimes takes some time to wake up.  But what was worse was that after I owned it for two weeks, the thing stopped working!  It was never dropped or damaged in anyway, it just stopped.  The display just faded away and wouldn't work again even with a new battery.  This one was such a waste of money, I'll definately buy a different brand next time
I have used pedometers for a few years. I was initially impressed with this pedometer BUT then I discovered the 360 I received did not always 'wake' and keep track of steps. The 360 I received did not always count steps even when already 'awake.' The 'sleep' 'wake' feature is bogus, it does not work and it makes this pedometer a loser. I would not be surprised if other users of this pedometer have simply overlooked the fact that their steps might not be getting counted because the pedometer is stuck in sleep. Heartrate Monitors, the company I bought it from was not responsive when I asked for guidance. I bought another pedometer from a different dealer, the Sportline 345 - It's my second 345, need I say more
I walk pretty much the same distance daily, and this device gave me wildly different readings for the same route. I could see being off by even 100 steps for variations in stride, etc. But off by thousands of steps? Hardly worth it
Initially a very good buy, however after only 3 days of very light use I had an internal piston head on one of the guns break while the gun was resting on a desk.... and I was in another room.  For the look and price its a good buy but you get what you pay for in this case
Im new to airsoft and wanted a couple pistols to screw around with friends with, and found these.  i probably just expected too much out of them, being about $8 a gun you shouldnt expect too much.  Well, me and a friend began shooting at each other, and the BBs curved largely to the left.  Not just a little, but one of them made a near diagonal line to the left.  They're really light (although expected with cheap guns) and have a really clumsy feel.  They at least look kind of neat, and the plastic orange tip is mainly hidden by that attached compensator (looks only).  I later bought a $30 gun at meijer and it shoots nearly twice as far, and shoots straight.  These are just useful if you have too many people and not enough guns.  Dont expect to win with these, unless you're fighting other people with the same thing.  And on another note, my friend pushed down the magazine release and it snapped off.  He wasnt pressing hard, it was just weak defective plastic. 
Well all i can say is don't buy it it does not shoot very well or hard just get a better gun
**********UPDATE - THE OLD REVIEW (see below) WAS FOR DIXIEKIP.  THE ONLY REASON IT'S STILL TWO STARS IS BECAUSE I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE IT. OLD VEGAS CHIPS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT HELPFUL IN THIS MATTER EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T ACTUALLY ORDER THE CARDS FROM THEM.  I WOULD ORDER FROM THEM ANY DAY OF THE WEEK NOW JUST BASED ON THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IN AN ISSUE THAT WASN'T EVEN THEIRS.   MY APOLOGIES TO OLD VEGAS CHIPS IN THIS MATTER.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM AND IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO CHANGE THE STARS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THESE CARDS, GO WITH OLD VEGAS CHIPS, NOT SOME OTHER DEALER!!!! - JIM ******************I ordered these particular plastic cards because in my opinion, they are much cooler than the paisley ones that are also offered.  I immediately ordered them, yet when my package arrived yesterday (in a timely manner, I will give them that) I opened to find the ugly paisley cards looking me in the face.  I have not yet contacted the seller to see what options I have, but this is going to leave me either two options, 1) return them and wait longer for them or 2)suck it up and get stuck with the ugly cards.  I will repost once I have spoken to them
The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it
The gloves looked great online but in actually, the quality of the product was not what I imagined.  The gloves lacked padding on the inner hand and palm.  Instead, it had a thin sheet of nylon.  The closure was not secure enough so I was able to slip my hand out even with it fastened on.  On the bright side, the gloves were pretty and I had no problems returning the product back to Amazon.com
The leather/pleather outting of the glove is soo thin that if you plan on doing any sparring plan on it tearing.  I used them once and tearing occured during padwork and sparring.  I would recomend getting a glove with a thick leather so you know that it will last through the beatings
I ordered it for Christmas but I didn't get it until December 27th.  It's now in a closet waiting for another gift-giving occassion
I am quite dissatisfied with the quality of the new Leatherman tools.  I purchased two Leatherman Squirt S4's and the Leatherman Micra from Amazon recently and was surprised to see that all of them arrived scratched up(like it was used before).  Some scratches were wide and deep enough to cause cuts on your hands when you use the tool.  I purchased the Leatherman Charge XTi from another vendor, which was also not of high quality that Leatherman was once known for.  I have owned the original Leatherman Wave since it first came out and have had no problems with it.  It seems like the newer models are being mass produced without some type of quality control.  Or maybe someone is repackaging used Leatherman tools and selling them as new...I will not be buying anymore Leatherman tools until they start making high quality multitools as they were once known for.If you want to buy one of these, either for yourself or as a gift, I would suggest you go to a store and look at it before you buy.  Make sure there are no scratches or smeared letterings or any other problems...The ones I recieved were definitely not good enough to give as gifts
I regret buying this gun. It broke within four days of buying it. We did just enough shooting to adjust the hop-up(for accuracy), and it fired great. It was really accurate. The gun was made of really cheap plastic, and the trigger stopped working. Right now, we're waiting for a RMA on it. I would recommend paying a little extra, to buy a more durable gun. I bought another gun that cost $55, and that one is made of much better plastic and feels much more durable
I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.
The specs on the bag stated that there were mesh panels for drainage and ventilation.  Well if there any, I sure couldn't find them.  Not a good quality in a bag used to place wet equipment.  The bag also has an awful smell that will hopefully dissipate over time.  I'm very sorry that I purchased this bag
This is a useless product.  I do not exercise much, and I do not even get a burn from this machine.  The DVD is boring and the instructor speaks in a mono tone.  It looks like it is low budget! 
Unfortunately ,I purchased this product . Thermometer and compass are not at all working. Thermometer always shows 65 F and Compass allways shows Err. I highly recommend NOT to buy this on
Bought mine sometime around Christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to St Thomas last week.  It died within 10 minutes of being in the water.  It was never more than 5' down while I was snorkeling.While I never tested the compass or thermometer against known "accurate" ones, it seemed to work well enough for my purposes.  Just keep it dry
Overall, not terribly happy with this units user interface and design.  The spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as "SW1" SW2" etc, but they are not labeled as such on the device.  You toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are ("TR" "CH" what??) Just an unfreindly interface all around. Look for a better unit.
Don't buy this compass if you need to know any direction. If you know about where the sun sets, you will be more accurate than this "compass." It is impossible to use in the field. A waste of money: inaccurate to the max, impossible to maintain it level, etc. Just junk. They should give them away
Had to return the first one due to non-functioning thermo and fault compass. Small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack, but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed. I also have a Brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer. We'll see how long the 2nd one lasts
One of the handles would not go in, the digital unit did not work and had no instructions on how to work it and when I would use the unit the little keeper ring on the side would cut into the side of the housing and cause some drag or friction. They told me to send it back for a replacement and I'm STILL WAITING and WAITING!!!  So I Would rate this unit a  -0-  How do I get my monies back??? 
I bought this gun thinking it looked like a cool and fun gun. I go through 1 freakin war with it and the thing wont cock any more and pieces are falling off it. I know how to treat guns but this is ridiculous, and for the record im not a kid im just to lazy to sign up
I ordered this gun because it was such a great deal. When it arrived, i took it out of the box and the barrel was cracked (a big crack), nothing a little gorrila glue can't fix though. Also the accuracy isn't consistent, it is always about 4 or 5 inches off from about 20-30 feet. I had to put the back part of the laser off the sliding mechanism to get it to be accurate, otherwise it was 3 feet high. The pellet also starts to curve after 15 feet or so too. So this gun was a good deal but isn't the best quality gun i've had. You have to load it from the top of the gun, which means taking off the laser, putting in the bbs, and putting on the laser again. The magazine doesn't even come off! It still has decent speed, and isn't crap (it's just bad). It was worth 15 bucks though
I purchased these Teva's for Kayaking. These are the most uncomfortable sandals I have ever worn.  They are even painful while sitting in a boat.  I do not recommend them
The only thing on this that works well is the watch...   the altimeter, thermometer and compass even after being calibrated give incorrect readings...   the stopwatch is difficult to start and stop and reseting it to zero takes some patience...  it looks cool and the time is correct but it is definitely not a reliable device in the least.
As others have mentioned already, I found this thing to be very, very "wobbly". I never, ever felt comfortable riding with my (almost 4-year-old) son on this thing. It just felt too unstable.I returned this after only a few days
I bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when I rode on vacation When I assembled the trailer, the chain was twisted.  I bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it.  Then the chain kept falling off the front chainwheel.  The sprocket was badly bent.  I bought a large screwdriver to straighten the chainwheel.  By the time I got it all working, my vacation was over.  By the time I see my granddaughter again, she'll have her own bike.  I'm going to try to find someone with a small child to give the trailer to
I rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid's bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike.  I also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child's bike straight, but I never recived the part.  I am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they didn't help me. I hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs.Thank you
Just to warn you, this product does not come with a USB cable and it doesn't work with most laptops I have had.  You need a desktop for this product and the website for the product is not very helpful at all.  The ecaddy is great, but the caddylink is next to worthless
i ordered this item, and reding the other review i expected good results however i havent seen any results at all. i have to say theres just no subistute for old fashioned exercise
Front wheel was badly bent right out of the box and needed to be replaced. Box had no signs of damage so it looks like it was put into the box this way. I replaced the front rim at my own expense and assembled the bike only to find it also needed a tuneup. The gear shifters were not adjusted properly and shifting would often result in the chain jumping back and forth.I didn't want to pay for a tuneup and hope there wouldn't be other expenses down the road to deal with so I decided to return the bike and buy something local I can get a look at before we buy
My complaints about this stand:1. By far the worst thing about this stand is it leans too far forward.  There's not enough counter-weight so a slight pull on the bike will cause the thing to tip.  If it wasn't for this, I might say, "well I guess it's alright for 79 dollars."2. The clamp isn't strong enough to hold the bike securely.  If you clamp to seat-post for example it will rotate on the seat-post.3. The thing that tightens the clamp is made of plastic.  I'm assuming it will break fairly quickly.4. The rotator is made of plastic - I haven't tried rotating on the seat post where it would put any weight on the rotator, but I doubt it will hold it.In my opinion this product should not be sold.  If you just want to clean your bike on a stand, it's fine, but for anything that requires any force like taking the pedals or crank arms off, forget-about-it
I ordered this item, thinking it was a pair.  When I received it and realized my error, I ordered another of the exact same item.  When I got it, I found that it was half an inch wider than the first, a different shade of color, and the pile seemed thinner and flattened.Now I'm ordering a pair from a different company.  Hopefully the higher price indicates better quality
I bought four of these and all of them broke within the first or second use, making them completely unusable.
I measured the reservoir and got only 2 liters plus a cup
I try to use this but don't work good!!. The best option is play in a court
This is not what I expected it to be at all! It did not come with a pole and it did not improve my skills. If at all it made my wrist hurt more.
The advertising was not clear as to what your getting; it does not include the stand for the ball assembly
I tried this on the day I got it to see how it felt.  The velcro is so strong that when I tried to take it off, the velcro ripped the top layer of the material right off.  I would not advise buying this.  I was dissappointed in the quality of this product.
The best ever!!!  If you don't have on buy one. But buy the bag
Like you (I'm sure) I saw this machine on television (mistake number one) and then ordered it online without ever trying it first. This machine is a joke. If you cannot get your legs over your head then MAYBE this machine is for you. But this is NOT for serious users who stretch everyday. I can do more with my $5 stretch band from Target than I can with this big heavy space-taking piece of junk. The resistance is zero, and just laughable over all. Save yourself the money, and frustration - buy a lightweight no-hassle stretch band!
I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Why by a gun from these guys?  If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back.  Want a refund?  You pay a 15% restocking fee.  Take a pass on Airsplat.
Its light was okay, although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book. The main problem is it's too shabby to survive a battery change--so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out. Also, finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy.
Not Amazon's fault, but Everlast's.  Even the box promises 2 10-pound weights, but it is in fact a 10-pound set of 2 5-pound weights.  This is not a bargain, but fairly expensive.  Quality is just ok.  Not flimsy or dangerous, but not what I wanted, either
The description doesnt mention it, but the weights are sand filled bags. When using all 5 of them  at the same time the weight is very bulky and uncomfortable.
I got this because it was cheap at K-Mart, and thank goodness I can return it. The ball is really small--I love how they omit the size from all of their information. I didn't pump it up with the pump, so I don't know how good that is (I used an air compressor)...the other equipment isn't too bad, but I was really getting this for the ball, which just so happens to be a piece of poopola. I wouldn't suggest getting this
I had a different experience than the other reviewer. I would also consider myself a beginner golfer, but the Medicus has not worked for me.   It might work if you have never picked up a golf club and you are learning for the first time, but if you are trying to improve your swing it doesn't help.  You develop a way to swing the club without breaking the hinge, but it is still a bad swing. I heard from a golf pro that it is good if you already have a solid swing and you are trying to improve it, but not good for beginners.
    They say it will be delivered in its original carton, but they don't mention they have been opening up the boxes and swapping out the new console boxes with returned ones.    The box came with two bright yellow strapping bands, and certainly looked sealed when I signed for it at delivery. Later that evening, when I cut the bands I was surprised when the top lifted open, the staples on the carton top were not attached and the box was already open. I cut the box open and started laying the parts out. when I pulled the carton containing the console out, the box end flap was open and smashed up where it had been put into the styrofoam. every thing else looked undisturbed. I pulled the console out of the box and could see that it must have been returned, the bubble wrap was torn, and the six screws to mount it were missing.   I called schwinn and they are going to send me the six missing screws, and I called Amazon to tell them what was going on, I would have sent it back, but I had cut the box open and don't think there is any way I could cram it all back together.    Just look the box over carefully when they deliver it, the staples on the top were carefully centered between the holes where the longer staples that originally sealed the box were removed. They sure fooled me into accepting a opened box.
The console that came with mine is broken...so I haven't been able to use it.  I have been told by the customer support people @ Schwinn/Bowflex - since the middle of February - that a replacement is on it's way (even the "supervisor" said this to me).  Hear that ticking?  Yeah, that's the clock on my warranty - it is just going away without ever even getting a chance to try the thing out.  Am I happy...NO!!  Maybe I'll write another review when I get my new console and I can tell you how wonderful this piece of equipment is - until then - I'm one heck of a ticked off customer.  Save yourself the headache and just go to the gym
I notice several other reviews mentioning faulty/defective consoles arriving. Well, I received my first Schwinn 438 about a month ago. I put it all together, and realized they did not ship an AC adapter with the machine. I contacted Amazon, they told me to either send the machine back for another or contact the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer on Saturday, they were closed. I contacted them the following Monday and they told me the item was on back order, but, I could buy a compatible adapter from Radio Shack. I did. I came home excited to use my elliptical, unfortunately, the console did nothing but beep at me..very frustrating. I contacted the manufacturer again, they advised me that the console was on backorder and would not be delivered for at least 2 months. They recommended I send the unit back to Amazon for a replacement. I did so. I spent the better part of a night taking the thing apart and repackaging it...quite a job trying to squeeze it back in the box. About 3 weeks later, I received my second elliptical. Same faulty console problem, after spending another couple of hours putting the thing together. Contacted Amazon and demanded a full refund and return. They did pick the unit up, and did not make me take it all apart this time, but, I am still awaiting a full refund. I have since purchased a Vision Fitness elliptical from a real fitness shop in my area. I am extremely happy with the unit, although it was a few hundred bucks more. This was one horrific experience with Amazon. I wouldn't recommend buying this product, seems like they are shipping out defective units
This pedometer is so cheap it isn't worth the $1.88 pricetag.  Unless you want to cheat yourself, this is not the pedomter for you.  You gain 20 steps just putting it on your pants, then walking to my co-workers desk five steps from mine I gained about 30 steps.  By the end of my work day I had apparently walked 11,953 steps that I mostly acquired turning in my office chair, and I won't even go on to say how many steps you gain driving in your car.  On top of all this, the company wouldn't refund me on the pedometers I ordered for my co-workers
This pedometer is not very reliable.  It is very inaccurate in its count.  It counts a step at the littlest movement.  I put it on counted out a hundred steps and checked it and it said 260.  Just moving it to look at it recorded more steps.  If you want something really accurate spend more money
I am the captain of a walking team and I purchased several of these pedometers as incentives for my team members.  I wore my pedometer before giving the rest out just to test it.  On the very first day, the pedometer lost count of my steps on three occasions, and by the end of the day, one of the buttons had fallen off.  I do not feel comfortable giving these pedometers to my walkers.  I should have invested a little more money per item to get the best value for my money
I brought this pedometers for my church"s walking program and we are not happy with them. My pedometer keeps falling off with a leach. Also,the biggest thing is that it keeps restting to zero. If I had to buy over again, I would not buy this pedometer
more of a novelty than a useful flashlight. need to shake it a lot to get a charge and even then the emitted light is too low to be useful. the switch has also broken and we havent even used the flashlight more than a couple times...would not recommend buying this flashlight, trying to return mine.
I should have read the previous review before ordering, because this product did not work at all.  The on/off button did not work/click.  The light produced a very faint light, less than a cell phone emits.  Don't buy this product; there are better flashlights out there
I purchased 5 of these for Christmas presents. I tried one out in order to demonstrate at the proper time.Number 1: This was dead in the box. So were numbers 2, 3 and 4. I didn't bother with number 5. Every flashlight was shaken more than what the measly instructions suggested. Speaking of instructions, they tell you to "make certain the light is off before attempting to charge." There is a rubber button that doesm't click or sound in anyway do there is no way of telling what the on or off position is.Real junk, says "hummer", made in China and all five are going back
This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler. 1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy 2. Door Stop 3. Play Street Hockey 4. Stress Release Stomping Toy 5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift 6. Modern Art for Coffee Table 7. Nerf Ball Target Practice 8. Condom Dispenser Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun! PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at: Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it.
The item was broken when I received it. Also, It is not what the picture looked liked. Very poorly made
This front fender worked well for a few days until the attachment mechanism thing snapped when I went over a medium sized rock
This Fender is WAY to short on a 17" frame with 26" wheels. 80% of the frame were it suppossed to stop the mud and bricks hitting fails badly.  the rear part is abuot 5"+ to short to stop most of the mud.I got it to stop bricks damaging my Giant bike frame and failed....2 stars for build of it and the 20% of mud it actualy stops..DO NOT buy this is you plan it for the same reason i got it for..
This might work fine if you use a bike rack to transport your bike...but I laid it in the back of my pickup and it snapped. Not very durable
When it is windy, the top of a canopy like this needs to be removed to prevent wind damage. No information is available on how long it takes to do this. I called D.C. America and they say they are only distributors and buy it overseas and have no idea and have no manuals available online for me to look at. They said it takes a few hours to assemble or disassemble. One retailer I spoke with, Fogdog, guesses it would need to be disassembled to remove the top, but he admitted they have not tried assembling it.So it appears from what these two sources said that every time a wind storm comes up, it would require half-a-day to disassemble it then reassemble it - not something I care to do.Are there any owners out there that can answer this question? Can the frame be left up and only the top covering removed? If so, how long would it take to remove the top covering? Is it easy to do? It is a nice looking unit, but unfortunately the sellers cannot answer the most basic question for an item like this. Thanks.
The accessories that come along with this nice are great, albeit somewhat impractical (who's going to use a slingshot, anyway?), but the thing that stands out most about this knife is the plastic handle.  Survival knives with hollow handles can go either way as far as usefulness and quality, but this handle has a cheap, brittle feel to it that suggests easy breakage.  It's not too hard to conceive that the blade could break off from the handle under enough stress, which makes this blade a dangerous one to use.  Do not buy this knife, or any other knife with a hollow plastic handle
The motion sensor wouldn't turn it on.  It does not maintain calibration.  Cold weather numbs it. I'm tossing it out
This product never worked -- buttons were defective, it wouldn't stay on, it wouldn't calibrate. The seller - Sky Box USA - wouldn't exchange or refund because I was outside of the "30 day window" (this was a Christmas present, and a very disappointing one at that). You'll want to look elsewhere for technology that should be as reliable as a Casio watch
Don't count on this compass or you will get lost. It is not the least bit accurate
First, the directions on assembling this product were in impossible to understand CHINGLISH. 2nd, the gun broke immediately upon use. Hot import toys never answers their phone and never returns calls. THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU. Don't throw your money away on this one
The IR link for the Polar hear monitors is great.  It allows you to transfer data 2 ways from your PC:  you can download your exercise data, and also change the settings for the watch from the computer.  This is great, because it means no scrolling through abbreviations on the watch with the tiny buttons.The biggest problem with the IR link is the driver that needs to be installed on your computer.  For whatever reason, Polar decided not to pay Bill Gates to get the software recognized as being compatible with Microsoft.  When installing the driver from the included CD, warnings and error messages pop up to discourage you from proceeding, which will compromise all security and firewall features that you might have.  There is no updated version available for download from the internet.  I went ahead and installed the driver, but since doing so, the computer has not been functioning properly, and I've been getting those "send error report / don't send error report" pop-ups from Windows.  Polar denies responsibility and insists that their driver is "fine" for use.  I'm no computer expert, so I don't know for sure, but I don't believe them
I'm pretty good at getting devices up and running, but this thing is a complete mess. They don't have the software figured out, and the instructions for trying to fix it when it's not working are preposterously complicated. Note that it comes with no directions of any kind. In fact, it arrives with an unlabeled mini-disc with no indication of what it's for, what it is, how to use it, whether everyone needs it, or anything else. Nothing but the blank disc. Note that this device failing to work is a "Frequently Asked Question" on the Polar web site, and they have a list of about thirty things you're supposed to "check," most of which they don't explain as far as what it is you're checking FOR. (In other words, they say "Check the [whatever] setting," but they don't tell you anything about what that setting should be or what might be wrong with it.) Most of the instructions are outdated, don't apply to current version of Windows, or don't reflect current versions of their own software.Mine will be going back -- the first thing from Amazon I have ever had to return
I received my Valeo Ocelot training "glove", still waiting for the other.  Bubble pack had only one glove in it.  Amazon HELP has no concept of partial shipment
These balls are horrible, they don't bounce like regular balls, worse yet once they come up from the ground it does not come up straight, it goes to the sides most of the time
Well today Feb 25 of 2007 the book still don't arrive ..
These ping pong balls were a waste of money. None of them bounce correctly. They either bounce off to the side or the only bounce a couple of inches. They are also really soft, and make a terrible sound when you play with them. The seam is evident on all of them
I bought this ab roller after my chiropractor told me that I needed to strengthen my abs without straining my neck.  The "neck support" that it comes with does not support the neck or head in any way, but forces all of the weight of the head onto the uppermost vertebrae of the neck.  Ouch!  I would strongly recommend AGAINST this purchase.  Not only does it not work properly, but the foam pads were stained upon arrival.  Gross!  I will try another model
IT MAY BE A GOOD PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, BUT IT'S TOO BIG.  IT'S BIG BECAUSE YOU CAN LEAN ON IT AND DO LEG LIFTS, ETC. BUT ALL I WANTED TO DO WERE CRUNCHES.  IT WAS HARD TO PUT TOGETHER ONLY BECAUSE THE SCREWS WOULD NOT FIT INTO THE SLOTS, I ALMOST BROKE MY FINGERS.  I GAVE IT AWAY AND BOUGHT A SMALLER ROLLER THAT WORKS BETTER FOR ME
I can't believe they sell such a piece of c...p!After inserted the 9V battery, I just pushed the button to start shuffling one time, and I heard a cracking noise right away. One piece of the mechanism fell off, and I could hear it when shaking the box. Of course, the shuffler was broken... Wished I could have read the first comment before buying that piece of c...p in some store

I wouldn't recommend this shuffler to anyone.  It shuffles more from one side than the other.  When through shuffling on the left side the right side is only half through.  The cards will jam in the tray stopping the rest of the cards from coming down.  The switch just works part time, you have to stop and restart several times
I bought this for my four year old for Christmas.  The net was broken on the second use when my four year old lightly banged it on our car bumper.  A week later, his friend, also four, broke one of the sticks when taking a shot with the feather-weight plastic puck that comes with the set.  Don't waste your money. Even for little kids it's probably worth it to just go ahead and buy real equipment that will last.
it really deserves a 0 rating -- non- skid surface is a joke -- it is slick as glass -- tripod dog could not get any traction with single hind leg -- golden slipped off side and hurt her leg -- learn from my mistake -- there is NOTHING positive to say about this product
The present model is not the newest available and it has the disadvantage of hurting the nose by prolonged use. The newest presentation has solved this problem
To call this a bad machette would be to generous. It is more accurately described as a machette shaped object. As other have noted the blade is thin, too flexible, easily rusts, and fails to hold an edge. The handle is poorly made and mine had sharp edges where the handle halves were joined. If you use it without wearing gloves this "tool" will do more dammage to your hand than to the target vegetation. Th sheath material is 1 step above paper. Technically it will hold the machette on your belt. But if you draw the machette with anything other than utmost care you will cut the sheath. I can't believe a company with a valuable name like Coleman would put their brand on this embarassing piece of garbage.
This tool will not take an edge, either with a grinder or a file.  It is very flexible so that the energy of a blow goes into flexing the blade rather than cutting stems, which has undesirable consequences for your hand.  If you are looking for a useful tool, keep looking
These Coleman machetes are essentially useless.  They are so lightweight and flexible, I don't know what they intended them to be used for.  They will cut some weeds, but they won't cut through brush or any woody plants thicker than maybe 1/2 inch.  I have used a few of these, as they are the most commonly available at the hardware stores where I live.  They also rust badly.  You're much better off with an Ontario Knife machete, or another better machete.
We were very disappointed with this style trampoline enclosure.  As it only attaches to 4 of the eight legs, it essentially reduces your round trampoline to a much smaller square.  We were constantly trying to find ways to pull it away from the jumping area as it sort of "caves in".  We finally gave up and purchased a new one that attaches on the OUTSIDE of the poles that attach to all eight legs
I was looking for a trampoline and I kept looking around for the encloser trampolines.  I purchased the 13 foot trampoline encloser but I didn't realize that the trampoline came separate.  I have the encloser kit witch I spent $70.00 on and no trampoline.  When I looked on the internet I never saw that the tramponine was separate and it wasn't clearly explained that it was just the encloser part.  I also found out that the size of the trampone is not standard, therefore, in order to utilize the encloser kit, I have to spend another $110.00 for shipping on top of the shipping it cost me for the cover and the encloser kit.  I am really upset that this is costing a large amount of money just because they didn't specifically say that the encloser kit needed the trampoline. Bevery careful, it is not every day that you go out and buy a trampoline and the encloser kits are totaly separate.  I am very disapointed
These noisemakers are too big and hard for my one year old, she bonks herself with them. My toddler and preschooler are not particularly interested in them. They make fairly interesting noises, but are awkward to hold and shake and are somewhat heavy for their size. No one really plays with them much. I would not recommend them.
1. Calories shown during a workout are about 1.5 to 2 times actual.   I do have the right weight entered in my user profile.2. Machine broke right after warranty ran out.   No manual. No reasonable support. I paid $850, including shipping.   It is now sitting in my bedroom in a state of partial disassembly.   Nothing about fixing this is intuitive. Some of the nuts and screws    are so tightly put on, you cannot budge them.I am going to throw this junk out and buy a non-schwinn elliptical thathas a better warranty and real servicabilty. Customer support at 1-800-864-1270 is practically useless.Save you rmoney. Buy something else
I loved the machine - until it broke.  THERE'S NO FRIGGIN' TECHNICAL SUPPORT OR REPAIR OPTIONS from Schwinn.  They don't care. 
We received this product for Christmas in 2005 and within two weeks the console broke. We contacted Schwinn immediately and was told we would receive a replacement console. It is now May 1st and the console we need is still on backorder --- 5 MONTHS!!!!! It is absolutely ridiciulous. I call each week and I get the same response.Unfortunately, we should have contacted Amazon within the 30 day period to get reconciliation from Amazon. Lesson learned there.The product when it was working was fine. But the pain since then is not worth it. I do not recommend this product
We bought this trainer over 4 monhs ago from a local fitness store.  From the beginning the heart rate programs never worked properly.  I train using a Heart Rate Monitor so I  can follow my heart rate during excercise,  If we tried to use the Schwinn's 418's HR programs it read anywhere from 40 to  60 BPM too low!!!, What that meant is that the machine kept on increasing the resistance thinking my wife or myself were cruising along at a nice 99 BPM when we were going aerobic at over 150 !!!.  Not only is that  dangerous, especially for someone who never trained before, but it made 30% of the machines functions unusable.  Add a display that's hard to read, controls that are anything but logical, and this unit is a loser, no matter what  Consumer Reports says.  On top of that spare parts took forever to get delivered, and when they arrived, the machine still malfunctioned.  The only thing good out of our experiance was the sales person  who worked with us to exchange the Schwinn for a better trainer from another company.  Bottom line,  stay away from the Schwinn 418, there's a reason Schwinn  only put a sx month warranty on labor and electronics, they knew this machine is worthless, don't you find out the hard way
After 350 miles of moderate usage (6.5MPH average at fairly low resistance for 40 minutes daily) a piece of metal snapped on one of the arms, rendering the trainer inoperable. Unfortunately this was considered a "wear item" and was not warrantied by the manufacturer since the elliptical was used *very* lightly (perhaps 20 miles max) during the first year of purchase (warranty period). I put the majority of mileage on the machine over the past four months and, while it was great for burning calories, I never really felt that it was a "quality" piece of equipment.It appears that the manufacturer knows what parts of the frame are likely to break first and conveniently labels these "wear items" , thus making repair expensive and difficult... this is in spite of the fact that the piece that broke was a non-moving, load-bearing support piece. Seems a little fishy to me.Throughout the life of the machine I was constantly tightening bolts to fix the popping and banging sounds that occurred after moderate use, and observed that the wheels would often attempt to jump out of the tracks with heavier use. After about 70 miles I noted that the wheels were leaving large greyish streaks in the tracks from where they were wearing down against imperfections in the track surface. I believe this was also partly due to too much "play" in the interaction of the wheels and tracks, allowing the wheels to jump the tracks a little which each revolution.This machine does not feel very sturdy and, throughout the last month of its very short life, gave me a creepy sense of impending doom whenever I used it... somehow I knew it was about to break and, unfortunately, it did. My hunch was real enough that I began shopping for a replacement several weeks ago.Please shop around... I would not recommend this machine for people looking for a moderate to high intensity workout, but it may be fine for slower walking or jogging paced routines that place less stress on the machine's mechanical components. If you are an infrequent user this model may be OK, but if you plan on using it every day I would recommend that you keep on looking.Note that my machine was a 428P which, at the time of purchase, differed from the 418 primarily in the computer and heart rate monitoring. The frame is identical in the 418 and 428P, which appears to be no longer sold. Since the problems with my machine were directly related to body construction, they are appropriate for a review of the 418. Unless the manufacturer has made major improvements the problems I experienced are likely to still occur. Visual inspection of the pictures here leads me to believe that no major changes have been made to the frame construction
I just bought this through Amazon and then put it together pretty quickly.  Packaging was lousy, as others have already mentioned, and 3 pieces were either missing or broken, so I had to call for them.  First customer service rep was ok, but the next day I found the pedal crank making a sound, and called back, but the next rep claimed that I put the pedals on wrong and refused to exchange the main part containing the gears.  I held up the phone to the machine so he could hear it, and he acknowledged hearing the noise, but said I would have to open up the unit and identify the broken or loose piece on my own.  The unit came w/ that part already sealed, so I don't know how they can expect me to spend my time playing maintenance technician on their product.  Although the product appears to be engineered well, any company that's not willing to correct their mistakes deserves a negative rating
The first Schwinn Fitness 212 that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit. The second one arrived but does not work. After calling technical assistance and being instructed to re-examine the contacts (which I did), it still does not work. This is absolutely useless. They will have to do something
My bike did not come with an instruction manual. This seems to be a recurring problem with this company
The only reason why I am NOT buying this product, is because the description doesn't give the lengh.  How stupid...!!!I am sure I am not the only one to turn this great product down.  Come on, think a little and tell us how long it is
This stopwatch has an amazing array of functions but is difficult to use; sometimes it behaves erratically and starts timing up instead of counting down, or starts all over again when the countdown is only half done. Don't know if it's really misbehaving or it's just on some obscure other function when I think I set it for countdown...? Operating manual is available online pdf, and it's several pages long
I was hoping to get a water bottle that was leak proof and would not sweat. I got neither. It is pretty , but that is about it.
This would be a great rebounder, if it were not so cheaply made.One month after happily using it, a spring broke, then another.It is one of the least expensive models out there and I guess there is a reason for that. Best to save your money and buy a more expensive model
I thougth that de signal is powered, to rise 16 miles, but it's not real. And the comunication is good only in open staces, like one in front of the other. Anything that is in middle of the recievers, cause interference or bad comunications
I previously owned and used the 5 mi. version to communicate with my wife while I am going to and from the school bus stop for the kids. From the bus stop the 5 mi. unit was iffy.  I purchased the 16 Mi. units thinking the little extra power and range would make for better receive at the bus stop. It was worse. We received no signal whatsoever, not a peep.  Don't buy this unit. Save your money and buy the 5 mi unit
Just did a A/B comparison between the SX800R (16 mile range)and the Midland GXT-450 (10 or 12 mile range).  Neither radio came anywhere near the effective range advertised.  The Midland lost communcation after 1/2 of a mile apart in the woods.  I then tried both radios on a flat open road.  At 2.9 miles apart, neither radio could pick up it's counterpart.  It wasn't until we hit the 1.8 mile mark that the Motorola picked up some static from the other Motorola.  Still nothing from the Midland.  At approx 1.5 miles apart, the motorola worked fine.  I gave up with the Midland.  The reason I did not give the Motorola a 1 star rating was because I like the weather band feature.  Bottom line is, that unless you are in an airplane with no obstructions at all or curvature of the earth to worry about, forget about getting anywhere near the advertised range.  A good rule of thumb is, if you can see the other person, then you are in range.
Moms and dads this toy is off the faheezie! It is so much fu
my daughter would love a trampoline and i would love to buy her one but i don't know which one to get her.  the airzone 8' trampoline seems perfect but i also read the reviews for the airzone 13' trampoline which got terrible reviews.  i don't know what to believe.  can anybody help
I bought this exact one maybe a year ago. About 2 months later it just collapses. Set up is not the onlt thing that is hard, actully trying to get a high jump is VERY difficult. This is a little kids toy but most little kids don't just like baby bounces do they? I would not recommend this trampoline to ANYBODY
I was attracted to the Thermoskin product because it looked more comfortable than rigid splints for night wear, and because Thermoskin advertised that it could be worn while sitting during the day.  The product indeed has a clever-seeming design, and it is well manufactured.  But ultimately, this product seems to me to be too floppy and unstable to consistently stretch out the area of the foot that FEELS to me like it needs to be stretched. (I.e., the area along the sole of my foot that I can feel stretching out in the mornings when, before getting out of bed and while sitting up in it, I press my toes hard against a looped cord or towel; that stretch significantly diminishes my pain upon standing up out of bed.)  The velcro fastenings are indeed secure, but the product's sock-like sleeve and ankle cuff move around some even when the straps are cinched down as tight as they'll go; as a result, what feels like an appropriate stretch typically disappears in about five or ten minutes of normal movement and friction in bed while lying down.  Worse, the angle created by pulling the strap up through the buckle in front of the lower leg just doesn't create the proper stretch; instead it just makes my toes feel crampy.I'm going to try a rigid split, which may be less comfortable.  But I believe that I need to be strapped into something that consistently maintains a proper angle, which the Thermoskin product doesn't.  And I'd rather incur some discomfort, if it will actually help me get well, than continue to use this not too uncomfortable (but ineffective) product from Thermoskin.  Perhaps others have had or will have better results with it than I have had; and I have no medical training nor deep insight into the anatomy or physiology beyond what I've read on the internet, so consider this to be very much a layman's review.  I've been suffering from plantar faciitis now for about four to five months with little improvement, and I can't compare this product to others that I hope might be more effective.  But I was very disappointed in this product, and regret having spent the money for it
WAS BILLED BY THE COMPANY AND THEY NEVER SENT IT...HAD TO CHALLENGE THE COMPANY TO GET A CREDIT...STILL WAITING FOR MY BILL TO SEE IF CREDIT WAS DONE..
Most enthusiastic cyclists and bike shop clerks I talked to dislike this product. I've used it a number of times myself and I would never use it again (especially after I discovered better products). It turns your chain and drive train into a black mess. Finish Line was better. TriFlow was recommended by a number of cyclists.
Nice looking skates, but very stiff boot and runs too small. Don't like the stiffness of the boot. Will not buy another RD product
DO NOT BUY THIS MAGAZINE!!!!  IT has been falsely advertised.  It does not hold 70 rds like it say but really holds only 30.  It is the exact same magazine that comes with the High Power Steyr.  I bought two of these thinking they were 70 rounds and got them today I feel completly ripped off
We purchased this ATV for our son who turned 7 in February.  The first time he rode it the battery came loose and disconnected.  We fixed that within a few minutes and he continued riding it.  The next day my son came in after riding it and the throttle was loose.  I tried to tighten it but the Allen screw stripped and it would not tighten.  In addition, the rear axle was bent from shipping.  We called service and they sent us a new throttle and tire rims, not axles.  I did not even try to replace the throttle because I knew the Allen screw was not capable of tightening properly.  So, I went to the local hardware store and purchased a stainless steel screw and was able to correct the problem.  The next day after he was riding it the steering was out of alignment so I twisted the handle bars and force them to straighten out.  I have to do this every time he rides the ATV.  The kids rode the ATV yesterday and I changed the speed key switch to the lower speed so my 4 year old daughter can ride it.  I have change the setting about five times and the switch broke.  It will no longer change to the slow setting.  It is either on fast mode or off.  Needless to say that my son does not want to ride on it because he thinks it will break every time he does
I purchased two of these, one for each of my sons. I received them quickly and the packaging was in good shape. When we took the first one out and tightened the handlebars and so on to get it ready to charge and ride everything seemed ok. But the wires where you plug the charger into the 4 wheeler had to tightened and so did the place you turned the key to change speeds. Got it charging, we think. Then we start on the second one. We take it out and the charger is half melted. Ok, not too good but since we ordered two we thought we could just use the charger from the other one since they were the same. Well, when we plugged the charger to the second four wheeler after about 1 hour we went back out to the garage where it was charging and the charger we were using that had come with the first four wheeler had started to melt! Nevermind that the house could have caught on fire! So apparently someone had plugged the original charger in and that had already happened, rather than someone just having packaged a defective charger. Nice for someone to pack it back up and send it to me used and defective. The first four wheeler turned on and ran ok for a few minutes so it must have been charged, we went ahead and plugged it up as the instructions said - as if we had received it brand new like we thought we had. When it was used the first time it ran for a little over an hour, with only the the light popping out of the front with every little bump. And the light didn't work. While trying to re-attach the light we found several places that needed to be tightened up. We can't re-charge it though because the only good charger between the two was melted. When we first took these out of the boxes they were small (big enough for a 3 or 4 year old) but they looked pretty sturdy, much better than the plastic ones you get from Walmart, and I paid close to the same amount. They were difficult to get out of the packaging, because there is a metal frame in the box that needed to be taken apart, but that should have been good, to protect during shipping. However when you think about how you are going to get them back in the metal frame and box and shipping to send them back so someone can possibly see how bad the whole mess is you start to get cranky and tired. I will admit that I haven't tried to return them. I am quite worried that it will be as much trouble as these things have been already. I am tempted though, because I would like to let people know about this type of problem before they waste their money. Imagine how dissapointed I was that right before Christmas I couldn't give the kids two of their bigger gifts because they were junk. I am VERY upset. So now several hundred dollars (times two) that could have bought very nice Christmas presents just flushed down the drain.
Purchased three of these at Christmas.  Horns and lights did not work on but one, another was missing keys when delivered, luckily interchangable.  Within 5 days, one four wheeler had a faulty throttle and quit, the drive train fell out of the other with bolts going everywhere, and the third had two bald tires which burst!  All this before the new year turned.  I contacted the company, and they offered assistance by sending a box of parts in the mail.  However, they offered no assistance on actual repair, telling me that "any man can do it with a few tools".  After several hours and a visit to the tire shop, I fixed the bikes and they seem to work fine for now.  I obviously question the quality of the product and be aware return shipping is not an option b/c these bikes are heavy and it would be cost prohibitive.  I would buy at a store where I could take back if needed.  Good luck.   
I ordered a product that showed a correct hinged replacement fixture for my Igloo cooler but when it arrived what showed up was a completely different product of lesser stature and quality. I will never order from them again
This is not the same model I bought but it looks like it's built the same way.  I bought the InMotion Trampoline by Stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use.  It didn't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off.  When I called for warrantey information, I had waited too long, it is only guaranteed for 90 days.I'd give it negative stars, but I have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up
I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the "sticky" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor.
This tricycle is simply way too big.  While the seat position is adjustable, even when adjusted, this thing is simply huge!  I imagine my 2 year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster.  By then, he'll be 5 or 6 and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike, so I just don't get the point of this.  Why in the world would someone build a trike so big?I did like that the trike had large pneumatic tires, and was fairly sturdy (at least in terms of construction).  I suppose if you have a really large child that wants a trike instead of a bike, maybe this monster would be OK. I did have a few issues with design and/or build quality though: First, the grips are fairly fragile plastic and I imagine will break after just a tumble or two.  Second, the way the seat "adjustment" works is simply by sliding the seat clamp up and down the main support bar.  This would be OK, but the seat clamp was too big for the support bar, so I had to shim it with something to get it to stay in place.    Overall, I'm just not very impressed.    
This watch has a great look and much potential 'under the hood', but I am having to return mine because of a defective altimeter - it gives readings of up to 1000ft difference in altitude over the course of a few days in the same location during the same kind of weather. I was also disappointed to find that the alarm was barely audible - certainly not loud enough to get my attention if it is under my sleeve - and the metal finish of the watch and band is extremely scratch-prone. I cannot recommend this watch for the price it sells for, even if the altimeter worked correctly.
I hate to rate this item poorly but it didn't work well for me. I installed it in my basement. It's hooked between two joists that are right under my living room floor, everytime I hit the heavy bag the living room sounds like someone is taking the place down. Solid product for the right location.
If your toes get hot it has a zipper for that. (useless)  Better off getting a rectangular if you need more legroom.  Its small (Even the long one)for a big guy.  I wouldnt use it for anything but the summer (and you will most definatly need a good pad
The bag is nice and everything, but the zipper does not come down very far and makes the bag tough to get into.Also, my feet got cold because of the zippered area.  Not really sure I understand why it's there.  My feet never get warm, usually cold.I liek the material and the look.  Also seemed to keep me warm on a 60 deg. night
its rickety. the bar stands are right where you would want to grip the bar so your either way too wide or close on your grip with a constant battle to not pinch your hands when putting the wieght back up. it is also very hard to adjust and often get stuck. in incline position the stands get in your way again because it obstructs your range of motion. not worth half the money it goes for
The compass is wholly unreliable.  The light button turns on in your bag, thus draining the battery.  One of my worst Amazon purchases
I figured I'd give these a shot, since I've heard good things about them.  First off, though, to put these tees in the ground, you have to guide them with a finger; otherwise, they'll bend. The control and distance differences for me seemed negligable compared to traditional wooden tees.  Also, because of the sharp edges, there are now some nice grooves on the sole of my new 905R.  I wouldn't recommend these tees if you have an expensive club you don't want dinged up, unless those extra five yards really mean that much.  If you have a slower swing speed than I do, though, (mine's about 105-110mph) the grooves might not be an issue.The only reason that I gave these even two stars is because they last forever.  When I was trying them out, I was playing 18 holes, minus the par 3's, without breaking a single tee. Overall, though, they aren't really suited for me as is
The HR monitor buttons got stuck in the down position on 1st use, no use any more. Also the shape of the back suggests it is designed for small wrists, not at all comfortable on mine
This product was dificult to get a heart rate reading on unless you are walking, would not give a heart rate even at low running speeds. I used this product 4 times and both heart monitor buttons fell off
Don't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch.  This monitor is sold as "providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout".  Since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout Reebok did to substantiate this claim.  Get a strapped monitor for working out.  While this is a great idea the design doesn't match the intended purpose
I only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began. It started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else. Very annoying! Also, the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse. While it is a low impact machine, it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals. This is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout. I am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine. Do not waste your money
i bought a supra model gazelle at sears for 179.00. i thought it is so light and the shock absorbers made a good form of resistance. well after a year the welds cracked for the shock absorber holders and are useless so i took them off.the guy at sears(where i bought the junkpiece) says,"Ew,man too bad"!!Remember that the light tubuler construction while making for ease in transport also means ease in breakage. Another machine meant for looking good in leotards sipping a sports drink and put it away if you start sweating.if you dont the sweat will rust out the weld joints and who knows where you'll be catapulted to when the next thing on it goes.maybe Maybe Tony little will give a surprise visit to you in the hospital!
I bought this bag for a 7 day bivouac hunt in the North Dakota Badlands. The average nightly temps were 40-50 F. The bag was warm during these windy and chilly nights. The bag compresses down reasonably small and is relatively light weight. On my second night of the hunt, I was zipping up the bag and the zipper broke right off of the bag. It didn't just come off, it literally broke. There was no way to fix this in the back country. I had my hunting buddy wrap some duct tape around me at night and then unwrap me like a giant tamalie every morning. He spent big $$$ for his bag and of course, had zero problems with it. Oh well, for the price and free shipping, this isn't too bad of a deal, just remember to bring plenty of duct tape with you.
I receieved the Valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym, after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous. I purchased them after I lost my previous pair of TKO Fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems. I put on the Valeo straps and did one pull-up, and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in. My advice, this product is poorly made and cheap. A complete waste of money. Go with something better, and I would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric.
I give it two stars for the Snorkel, the mask and the fins are just JUNK!! The Mask: The mask is a purge mask...meaning it has a small disk that, in theory,lets you blow any excess water that enters the mask by just blowing. The problem is this, any speck of debris that gets caught between the disk or a simple malformation will cause water to constantly enter the mask. AND if you happen to suck in via your nose you'll definately get a mask full of water.The Fins: The're a strap type fin which is good BUT they are so tight you can't wear any dive booties or dive socks which comes in quite handy if you're walking over coral, rocks or any other sharp objects. The biggest issue with the fins is the strap comes off while swimming. This set was for my wife and hers came off I didn't think to much of it until mine did too. You might say, buy smaller fins but they run in a Size x to Size X so you can't buy any smaller. The Snorkel is ok, It's a little short but it works
Ummm.... Why should I pay 20 dollars for this when it comes free in a 5 dollar comic book
We would like to send this item back.  The construction was flimsy, and the assembly is very cumbersome.  One of the pieces broke when it was being assembled.  The item was inexpensive, but not worth the trouble to assemble
I found these gloves to be OK for short rides, but the stiffness of the material around the fingers made it painful.  I actually had to remove the glove from my right hand after a while because the pain was getting annoying.  Granted, these are Mtn Biking gloves, I don't understand why they would make them so stiff as to actually dig into the hand.  I've tried to break them in, but after a dozen or more rides, they are still stiff
I saw this design and thought it was a great idea. After using it twice my wrists still hurt. Now I know why I couldn't find this design at my local sporting goods store
I ordered the Pogo Roo Pogo Stick on Dec. 6, 2006 and I am still waiting for it to be shipped.  They just bumped it back another month to mid May for delivery and yet if you go to the web site it says it is in stock.  Best of luck to anyone who wants it within 6 months!  Very poor service
The pogo stick that I ordered was not the same one that was sent to me in he mail.  I have to say though that the return was easy.  The company had UPS come to my house and pick up the product and I was given a full refund immediatly.  The item was not great...but customer service was good
For one, the gun doesnt shoot 380 fps.  Secondly they spelled enhanced "enchanced." They may have even done this on purpose, seeing as you are taking a chance by buying the gun.  It's about 50/50 whether or not the gun comes to you in working condition
Do not buy this gun from Hot Import Toys. That is my main point. It took a very long time to get to me (8 days) and when it did, it was broken. Not that it was shattered or it was jammed. It just didn't work. The piston seemed to be fine, the motor seemed to be connected, the gearbox seemed to be in tact, the batter (although a little hard to install) was charged, and the trigger was connected to the gear box. I thought that I could return it for either a working gun or just a refund. No. I e-mailed HIT over 7 times over the course of a couple weeks. Nothing! I got no response, no notification, nothing. I continued e-mailing them because they didn't even post a phone number to reach them at on their site! HIT is the worst company to buy from ever! From what i see and know, this gun seems to be quite the MPEG! I would have loved to use it to its fullest with my friends but unfortunately, I bet you anyhting that HIT will decide to wait until the 30 day warranty has expired before they e-mail me back: telling me of how the warranty time is up and that they aren't allowed to exchange my product. BUY FROM AIRSPLAT!!! Trust me. This is a good gun. Fast, accurate, good looking. Do not waste a month of your time waiting for it to arrive, having to find its broke, waiting for them to e-mail you back, and then have to live with a broken, useless piece of potential Airsoft gun. So trust me, don't buy from Hot Import Toys
The gun did not work.  When we emailed Hot Import Toys, they gave a suggestion on how to fix it.  That didn't work.  We emailed them asking for a new one.  No response.  We emailed them again, asking for a paid return label since we paid over $20 in shipping and handling.  They told us to take it to Fed Ex and tell Fed Ex it was defective and that Fed Ex wouldn't charge shipping.  Fed Ex doesnt work like that!!  We called this company numerous times, left numerous messages...no return calls.  We emailed Amazon and complained.  Got a response from Amazon and had to pay over $19 out of pocket to send it back to Hot Imports.  Amazon says they will credit our account.  I strongly suggest to take your business elsewhere.  No invoice was enclosed with the product.  My sons friend also ordered from this company and the gun did not work either..
My friend and I both bought this gun. We both charged it for the recommended time and it never worked. I could throw BB's with my toes faster than this if the gun worked on a good day. In ten minutes only 1 BB came out of the barrel and it just rolled out. It doesn't work, 'nuff said. All it's good for now is to be my back scratcher. Buy a pack of bendy straws to shoot BB's, they will work better than  this gun. Thank you for your time. Good nigh
I have an ICS M4A1.  I am basing my thoughts on this based on what some of the airsoft forums I am registered to have said on this.  I am registered on Arnies, Airsoft Core, and Airsoft Retreat.1) This gun is from a very, very unreliable company (Well), so you have more chances of getting a bad gun than you do for getting a good one.  This is common knowledge among the airsoft community.2) Lets say you buy 4 of these guns... each of them costing 100 dollars.  Even over a 5-10 year span, that adds up to a lot of money being spent on a gun that breaks consistantly.  People who have skirmished with an LPEG (Low-Powered Electric Gun) find that the exterior can actually break if shot at with an AEG that shoots 330 FPS with .2g (standard for companies like Toyko Marui, ICS, Classic Army, G, Airsoft Elite).  The one thing that this suggests that the gun is badly made.3) The gearbox (part of gun that fires bbs) broke on mine.  In short, it has a metal gearbox, made of the cheapest metal known to man.  The purpose of this for the company that makes to this get money.  It is very, very weak.  Definitely not worth it.4) The "Hop-Up" on this gun is non-existant.  The fundamentals of hop-up is a backspin is added to BBs to increase range and accuracy.  Effective range of this- 50 feet (not meters).  Effective range of my ICS M4A1 (with a aftermarket tightbore added) is 150 feet.5) This gun will get laughed at.  Some children walk into an organized skirmish with this LPEG, telling people that it will own all others, and they will cry home when players with real AEGS destroy them.  I suppose it is fine for backyard wars, but who on Earth would spend 100 dollars for a crappy gun for backyard wars?6) The cost does not equal quality.  If you think about all of the accessories that come with this gun (light, laser, ect), then account for shipping from CHINA, then the packaging costs (pre-molded styrofoam), you will realize that this gun is very, very cheaply made.  You do not want to be spending so much for so little quality.  The laser itself can sell for 20 dollars.Put it short, it is not worth it
We bought two pairs of these (his and hers - sizes Large and Regular) direct from the manufacturer. The gloves in both sets were of different sizes, and workmanship on everything was poor and clearly would not stand up to regular use. Too bad, because the concept is great.
I purchased these so I wouldn't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat.  However, they didn't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws.  Additionally, after only a few classes, the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws, particularly on the foot paws.  I guess they would be okay for someone who doesn't ever have sweaty palms and who doesn't do any intense postures.  Otherwise, I would recommend doing what I do now - use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather/suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat
The product is well made, and a great idea for travel without a mat.  However, I bought it so I would slip less in my postures once I started sweating.  However, although the paws don't slip on the floor surface, your skin slips out of them when you sweat, making them worthless. Guess I will stick with having a towel around!
Too big and cartoonish, also very hard to get hands and arms in or out when fully inflated. 
Other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason. Over 65% of the decks are marked and unusable. That means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be OK for poker play (unless you're lucky). I have purchase casino used cards before and honestly, they are not worth the trouble
Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product
We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!  Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars.Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.  Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor
  I didn't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery.  This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable.  It does the job, but only just.  I've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably.  Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just won't come on.  At first it worked great.  Also, the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly.  Not in danger of falling off or anything, but just not a secure connection to the base.  Overall, the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work, but I did hope for better quality
This gun is absolutley terrible. The third time I shot it, the thing broke!The pellets it came with were not even perfect circles and you could not load them. I would tell you more of how bad this was but I really don't want to waste any more of my time
I bought this on amazon and used the free shipping and received it about a week and a half later... Took it out of the box, it's pretty simple to put together (took about an hour). But after about 20 minutes of riding the bike on tension # 6 the rubber belt has flipped off it's wheel (like a bike chain off its gears). The bike is now completely useless as there is no resistance anymore. And I can't get to the belt to try and fix it because the cover is impossible to take off without breaking it. Tried calling customer service but they are only open on weekdays 9-5, going to have to call them from work on Monday.Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a more quality item than this. It'll save yourself a trip to the dump, too. This bike is a piece of junk
Description of bike was misleading.  Weight limit of person using this exercise bike should have been part of description.  Small print in booklet accompanying bike says it is unsafe for more than 250 pounds.Although I weigh slightly less than this, I am afraid to use the bike for fear of it falling apart.  I would not have purchased the bike had I seen this limit in the description.  Also, the directions for operation of this bike are very complicated.  I thought I was purchasing a simple exercise bike, not such a complicated piece of machinery.  This bike would be perfect for a younger, more athletic, slimmer person
Read the ingredients. Contains refined flour and sugar, hydrogenated oil, corn syrup, and artificial colors. For someone who may be sensitive to chemicals diabetic or hypoglycemic, this would be a poor substitute for real food. I personally would become ill from ingesting this sort of thing. Always read the labels and be sure that the product is safe for YOU
     I put this mount on my M-44 today, and I am not impressed.  There is side to side play due to the 1/32 or so gap between the side of the scope mount, and where the original sight seats.  Not a whole lot, but you don't need much play to have your zero [...] out after a couple of rounds.     All of the set screws are loose in their respective threaded holes.  One of the set screws stripped the scope mount threads before any tension could be placed on it.  The screw that passes through the sight ears was to short to thread the included nut on, so I mounted it with the original set pin for the rear sight.  The mount did not line up with the barrel when mounted, and this was obvious to the unaided eye - the mount was pointing left of true, and I don't know if the scope would be able to compensate!  I don't think Loctite will be able to hold the set screws in place, once a few rounds have gone down range.  Some of the supplied allen wrenches didn't even fit the set screws!     I have not fired the weapon with this thing mounted, and I am tempted to just toss it and chalk it up as a loss.  The design could work, if a little more attention was placed on the manufacturing process.     On the plus side, it was cheap, and the shipping was quick. 
This compass fails to do the one simple task I purchased it for, which is simply telling me which direction I am going. I spent $[...] for a [...] compass made out of crap materials. It works only for the direction you set it at. For example if you set it while facing north, it will be correct when you go north- but if you change directions, the result is completely random....This compass only works for one direction- and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually (gasp) might turn.absolute rippoff.
Please advise me if I can get a new Plu in senor Temp wire plug in this item come in defective and dont work? Please advise ASAP ThanksWalter Ga
The first one I bought started going crazy within a day. The ecreen showed unintelligible symbols and the like. EVentually I could not even power it on. I was told by PNI Global to take out battery and let in sit for 12 hours. Did that then it started breaking down again. The temp sensor did not work because anywhere I placed it it was affected by other sources of heat or cold. They sent me another one which did the same thing. Now I have sent my second one back and they are going to test it and probably send me another one (my third!!!). The good news is that they are nice in customer service
This is a nice heavy item, perfect for covering your trike.  But I have yet to figure out how to put it in place.  I'vr tried all sides and in between but have never gotten it on like the picture.  My son (yes, he is a grown man) put it on better than I had on my tries. but the front wheel is still out.  They need to put some arrows on it or something!!!Barbara LynchWilliamsburg, Va
I was very excited to order this bike.  As I started to put it together I noticed that some of the prepackaged parts for assembly were missing!  I still attempted assembly and noticed that pre-drilled holes weren't even close to being inline with the display!  The largest drawback and thing that upset me was that I didn't pay close enough attention when purchasing this - it is DOES NOT allow for adjustment from seat to pedals.  I'm 6'3" tall, and not being able to adjust for my height makes this completely unusable
These knives are terrific, unless you actually want to use them.  I threw these knives into soft pine wood and they bent like crazy.  One of them bect almost 180 degrees!  If you want to throw these into something softer (like pillows) these may work, but don't expect to throw these into wood
As a bicycle enthusiast who has owned CatEye products for nearly 20 years, I eagerly attached this light to by mountain bike and went for a spin around the streets and trails of Manhattan. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with its overall usability. The light uses three intense bluish-white LEDs that are very easy to see from a distance when facing the light. However, these are not powerful enough to illuminate a trail, road, or pothole. In short, the light is excellent tool to acknowledge your position to oncoming motorists and other cyclists.  The flashing mode is especially easy to see. Yet, the light is simply not powerful enough to illuminate the ground before you.  Hence, it is basically useless if you are trying to avoid potholes on roads or vehicle barriers on poorly lit bicycle trails.ProsGood ConstructionMultifunctionWaterproofConsInsufficient brightnessUses AAA instead of AA
title says it all. Dont purchase this to use with the Thule T2.
The item was packaged well, but it took over 15 days at normal shipping rate.  The lighter for it stopped working 15 minutes after it was opened. Anyone want the rest of this can? What a waste of time
I recently bought the Gaiam 4mm Eco Conscious Rubber Yoga mat because i want to practice my yoga on a environmentally friendly high quality mat.  After receiving this mat, i am EXTREMELY disappointed.  I feel cheated.  They claim that it is 4mm, but i measured it to be 2mm between the bumps and maximum 3mm on the bumps.  The mat is very flimsy,stretchy and slippery.  After 1 use it looks like it is rubbing apart.Gaiam claims that it is a natural rubber mat, but it sure does not feel like a natural rubber mat.  I have used a natural rubber mat at my studio, but it is completly different that this mat.  Even my instructor questions whether this is actually a natural rubber mat, since it feels so different than the high quality natural rubber mat at the studio.  If i wanted a cheap mat, I would have just bought one of the low quality PVC mats.  I should have spent the extra $5-$10 and bought a mat from a company that is know for their quality.  Dont make the same mistake i made
Not very bright for an LED.  AND, guess what? This is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes!Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack.I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this.
This case is mainly MADE OF PLASTIC!!  Don't be fooled by the "aluminum" description, only the corners were aluminum, the rest just PAINTED PLASTIC.  The case came poorly packaged!  The box was too small for the case.  The case had scuff marks, and scratches on it.  Obviously NOT BRAND NEW!!  This was the worst purchase I've ever made on amazon.  Will never buy ADG SPORTS again!!!  Their label was crooked on the case too!!  Looks like a 4-year-old put it on!!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  TRUST ME!!
I purchased 3 of these for a very old bike with no holes to mount a water bottle.  One of them worked perfect, snug fit and everything worked.  The other 2 had nuts that were too large to fit in the plastic.  This is my second, and last purchase from Zefal, I was happy it wasnt made in China... but i guess the French dont believe in good quality merchandis
Okay, I have owned the Mio for 9 months now and I agree with all of the above complaints, it is not accurate, it can be difficult to run and check heart rate at same time, it's big and clunky looking, etc, etc.My biggest beef is that this watch broke 6 months into the game.  The heart rate monitor got stuck and rendered the watch useless.  I returned it to Mio (with my $10.00 check) and 2 months later, i still have not got my watch back.  I complain regularly and they reassure me that it is being repaired in their factory.  They assured me that finally after I threw a fit, it would be shipped last week.  still no watch.  The watch not only sucks, but the company sucks as well.  save your money and buy an ironman.
Though the concept of a Heart Rate Monitor without a chest strap sounds convenient, the MIO is of absolutely no use during your workout. You have to stop your activity (be it running, biking or walking) to measure your current Heart rate, as your hand has to be steady. The calories feature does not measure the calories burned accurately and was off almost by 100 calories.
There is nothing wrong with this product, it's how you use it. We almost ruined our $300 trampoline in it's first week by using this product. We put it on our new trampoline and it fit fine. It rained the next day and filled completely with rain water, causing the trampoline to nearly collapse. It took a huge effort to remove the water out of the trampoline cover and we have not used it since. Trampolines are constructed using fabric that is breathable and will let the rain run through. By covering it, you don't allow it to drain. Unless you live in a VERY dry climate, I don't advise using a cover
This cover works well with keeping leaves and such off of the trampoline; but every single time it rains, I have to spend an hour or so getting the standing water out from the middle!  It is a back breaking job and it is hard to understand why trampoline covers are not made to handle this correctly.  More damage is done to the trampoline with the heavy water sitting there than leaves and limbs falling on it! This is a worthless item
I bought this for my pilates class and in middle of my plank my feet slid right out! Very dissatisfied, socks do not have enough elasticity to stay in place.  I much prefer the yoga socks where each toe is apart from the other. I would not recommend these for anyone
I take yoga in a gym.  The class starts as the aerobics session ends.  I bought these socks to help keep my feet warm during class.   Using the socks my big toes were uncomfortably separated from the rest of my foot.  I expected more elastic.  They made my foot cramp during the class.  Because I had worn them once I could not return them.  Now I do not know what to do with them.  I should throw them out but I spent money on them
I got this watch to help me decrease my times for 5k, and it defiantly not 95% accurate.  I run ~10-11 minute mile; yet, both on the treadmill and outside, this watch was reading ~7.5 to 8 minute mile.  Distance was also off by +20%, when running.  Speed and distance ~98% accurate for walking 15 min/mile.  
The handles on these knives, while having good balance, are the weak point.  These knives aren't meant to be thrown.  After minimal use they broke - at the handle
This backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck, it would have been better with metal zipper
I bought this unit two months ago and since that time I have used it sparingly. I went to turn it on today and it was dead. So I went out and bought a new battery and replaced the old one. Still dead. I tested the battery on a meter and it was full of juice, unlike this so called 'rugged' unit. A total waste of money, be forwarned
Have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed. If you move the compass (of your own choice or it falls off the windshield), you need to recalibrate it. I've been sitting at stop lights and seen a 10 swing of direction. I have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness
If it were possible I would rate this item at no stars, completely undependable. Requires constant recalibration lasting for all of a few minures. Have tried all the suggested remedies, including new batteries, nothing works. Next stop is the recycling center
I will not recommend this product. I use it in my car and most of the time is wrong. If you really need a compass you better read all reviews. I usually do it but I couldn't find about this product and well ... lucky it was only a few dollars.
I should have heeded the bad reviews on this site.I purchased this as a Christmas gift and tried to set it up for the recipient.  It was dead on arrival.I tried a new battery, still dead on arrival.  Both batteries tested OK, clearly it's a dead unit.I contacted the new manufacturer (NOT PNI as advertised) and am awaiting a response.I can't recommend this product.
This item was not very good,setup instructions poor, lighting poor, cannot view screen at night, forget it
Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
I will never deal with this company again! My product arrived late and was obviously very old due to the corroded batteries in the airsoft gun. It would not work after we cleaned it and I got no response from the company.I had to throw away the gun along with my money.I have enjoyed Amazon in the past but would appreciate them reviewing who they allow us to do business with.Thank
I bought this product on a Friday and arrived on a Thursday...Good shipping time but a horrible gun.  The pieces are hard to assemble and made of cheap plastic.  The whole gun was made of a cheap plastic which is not worth buying. I payed $30 for this gun and wasted my gift card for my birthday...Complete waste.  The laser's wires split, the gun does not shoot fully automatic and the FPS (feet per second) is slower than my Berretta Pistol.  Also the binoculars are cheap as well...it is just a gimmick to make you buy the product. Use your best judgement when buying this gun but it was not worth the $
My little girl was supposed to get this bike for her birthday (8/28) and due to missing parts. I was under the impression that i was buying a new bike not a used one. For the price i paid i should have gotten a new bike not a used bike that no one wanted. We have been having to go and order parts for the bike. The bike came with scratches and the bottles of paint that came with it were all dried out. The box that the bike came in was in horrible condition, it seemed as if it was left out in the rain for about a year. Then someone tried to tape the box together and ran out of tape. There were holes all over the place and i can see why i am missing most of the bolts and nuts.We were very disatified and when i called to complain the girl who answered hung up on me. I am very unhappy and this will problaly be my last order with this comapny.
I would easily be able to rip this box open. I refuse to put a 600 dollar hand gun in a piece of garbage like this. Any criminal with a little hand strength could easily get into this box quickly
The overall steel frame and structure of it is good, but there are too many flaws with this product, I recommend going with something else.  Flaws:  1) Bands do not give you good increments of resistence.  If you want even resistance on each side, you go from 20 lbs to 40lbs in one setting, which is crazy.  2) Workout and Assembly manuals are terrible.  Especially the Workout manual - what use is a machine if the correct use of it is not demonstrated?  What does that really say about how much Stamina cares about people using it correctly, without injury, and getting good benefit out of it?  Only about 10 exercises are really shown, the rest are just single pictures that let's you vaguely guess at what you are supposed to do, except that many are for some other machine, not this one. I'm sure someone will get injured from incorrect use.  3) Many of the pictures are misleading, such that you can't actually do many of the exercises suggested or inferred by the pictures.  One customer service person told me the pictures were of some prototype machine.  Ridiculous. 4) Several construction pieces I received were bad and caused problems, but replacement parts were shipped with no problem, albeit it meant waiting a week or so for each one, and then time to reconstruct the machine.  I had to replace the main Rail and a main leg support frame piece because they were both welded wrong.  5) Leg padding is inadequate and painful6) Doesn't seem to be a product that is understood or cared about by Stamina, no one I called seems to use it or really can tell you about it.For a company that claims to care about health and fitness, they really don't show it with this product or support for this product.  I'd go elsewhere. 
I bought this for my 5-yr-old, and he can't even get it on his head.  He wears other youth bike helmets, so I wouldn't recommend this item unless it's for a 2-3 yr old.  Now I have to pay half the price in return shipping
This bigwheel is so poorly made.  You have to affix the pedals and they do not stay on.  We put duct tape around the rod that holds the pedals on so they would stay.  The seat back has cracked already and we've only owned it one month.  The tassles on the handles don't stay in and the wheels are completely smooth so they offer no traction.  Lastly, there is no breaking mechanism.  Anyone who remembers riding a bigwheel knows that having a break is a must if you like to "skid out"!  Keep looking.       
A real colorful and flashy bike, however there were several things wrong with it. 1. the tires had so much excess rubber, it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed.  2. The back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings. If not done, the bike would basically come to a stop by itself.  3. the main (front) sprocket is slightly bent, so the chain falls off constantly.  4. the bike if VERY heavy. maybe that makes it sturdy, but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride. I should have just bought a bike off the floor at Wal-Mart or Target for half the price
I ordered this Pilates ring because I had used one in my health club- big mistake.  It is plastic with little resistance and is totally useless.  Wouldn't even be of much use for a wheelchair-bound old lady.  (The vendor sent it fast though.
Horrible. The trampoline came in with 3 out of the 6 legs missing. This is the second product form Stamina that came in damaged. I would NOT recomend to anyone.
Well, first of all, I never folded it up, because it was very difficult to fold, so I would just roll it into a closet.  I would jump on it everyday for an hour and it was great low impact exercise.I had it about 3 months and the suspensions snapped and I had a good shock as my feet suddenly hit the floor hard.  I weigh 110 lbs!  I really wonder how long this trampoline would last with a heavier person. 
If I could give them 0 stars, I would.  I don't know why they even still make these, as they should be illegal--and so should all that laminated foam rubber stuff they use in karate.The materials break up easily; the stuffing shifts and starts flying all over the place.  I could give tens of reasons why these are not only inferior, but complete garbage right out of the box.Everlast in general simply isn't good: low quality materials, design and workmanship, but these win the prize for all time worst sports equiptment in my book.  I recommend buying entirely Ringside--and this is coming from an experienced full-contact fighter
If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else
The description for this product states heavy gauge steel construction , but this only applies to the top section. The bottom straight section is made of cheap plastic . On top of that , of the 4 holes for the screws to go into mine had 2 of those stripped with a metal backing completely missing on one of them . Even the cheap logo stickers where placed completely off center , though that I could care less about.If I had to do it all over again I would have purchased "Perfect Pushup" by Bodyrev which amazon sells 
DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCTS FROM THE WESLO COMPANY. I just received my "Weslo Cadence C44 Treadmill" and have attempted to assemble it. The handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console. The Customer Service numbers are all disconnected. Their website gives an additional number to call, and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers, or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you. I have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them. This company is a complete scam. If you are even considering buying one of their products, your money is better spent getting your head checked
Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product
We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!  Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars.Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.  Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor
Who would sell a treadmill for a weight limit of 250 lbs.????Are only skinny people allowed to loose weight?Please - find a brain and make it those of us who REALLY need it
For several days I wore the watch in conjuntion with a belt-affixed pedomoter to establish the accuracy of the watch.  On every occasion, the watch did not count all the steps
Yes it does go and come off your head easier than most swim caps, but it doesn't keep your hair dry at all
Basically the title says it all.  I figured for a 100 dollars I would get a nice green and that the break would add to the challenge.  Basically this is a poorly made toy that shouldn't cost more than about 20 dollars much less a hundred.  Like I said in the title if you want an overpriced piece of junk then you hit the jackpot with the Tru-Break Putt 'n Hazard.  The only thing this is a hazard to is your wallet
Never received product. Ordered 6 of the flashlights on Dec. 3 for Christmas presents. E-mailed seller several times to find out where order was, they never answered my e-mails.Good way to do business!
I was disappointed in this product, and returned it - and bought "crank" type no-battery flashlights instead.  There were two things I disliked about the Diamond flashlight.  First, the light lasted a very short time - after shaking vigorously for a couple of minutes (they recommend just 90 sec. for a full charge), I turned the light on, and in less than 5 minutes it was very dim and almost useless.  I tried this a couple of times, with the same results.  The other problem was that shaking it for 90 sec. turns out to be a LOT more work than you would think!  I am much happier with both the light output and the ease of use with the crank type flashlights I replaced these with
Getting the flashlight is a real problem.  After paying for expedited shipping on Dec 1, meaning Dec 8th -- at the latest -- arrival.  Still waiting on the 17th.  Called customer service, who promised to call back in 10 minutes.  Never heard back on status.  Filed a claim for reimbursement on the item
I just bought these gloves and wore them for the first time at the gym. I now have painful calluses in my palm. The glove does not have adequate cushioning for weightlifting. Apart from that they look good on your hand but does not do the primary job of protecting your hand
Thi is HotImportToys at their finest. They are advertising this as a bullet(bb) proof mask for use in airsoft. That leads me to question why in the upper left corner it says "Not suitable for children under 3 years." Now, why would it say that? This mask is meant to be a toy, yet H.I.T is saying this will stop bb's. Don't they realize that by misleading people like this those people could be seriously injured, or even killed??? I think this really needs to be looked at by Amazon. This could seriously kill someone
hurts to wear and u can barly see out of it dont get it
My buddy died wearing this mask.  Well he didn't die but he lost his eye.  The mask got hit in the mesh and broke and all in his eye.
i dont have this item, but how can you expect this to be a good mask if the list price is $100 and they are selling it for $2.50!!!
I bought both the Nordic Gear batter-heated gloves and battery-heated mittens. Neither product provides adequate heat. The batteries work; but you get only a tiny bit of warmth. I see from the other reviews that my complaint is common. I wish I had read the reviews before buying
I bought these gloves for my wife who has problems keeping her hands warm. The description of the gloves would have you believe that the battery powered gloves (using D cell Batteries) would provide heat to the hands for 6 to 8 hours.  In actuality, the battery will only provide heat for 35 to 40 minutes before it ends.  To make matters worse, the only heat provided is to the palm of the hand, no heat is provided to the fingers!I did not use a cheap brand of battery for these gloves.  The first battery that I tried (it takes one D cell per glove) was Duracel with an experation date of 2013 (in other words, brand new battery with lots of shelf life left).  That battery provided heat for 40 minutes before dying.The second set of batteries that I tried (with the same experation date) were made by Eveready.  That battery lasted 35 minutes.  You should also note that the Duracel fits poorly in the connector case and the Eveready battery fits even worse!These gloves are on their way to Goodwill.  Maybe they can be used by some one as work gloves or something.  If you are considering these gloves, think again!  The chemical packs work much better although they (the chemical packs) do have a shelf life.  It just seemed such a waste to us to use a chemical pack for a one hour walk and then have the pack continue to provide heat for another 4 to 6 hours.  Still, that is better than using up two D cell batteries for less heat that only lasts about 40 minutes.
I trained for a marathon and several 10K races using a heart rate monitor. They are very good instruments for training and I recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape. After you've purchased one or two of them, you become a better shopper. I purchased an F-4 for a friend, and I was very, very disappointed in the battery life when I found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out. Some of the newer heart monitors - Nikon for one- have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years
Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
Not very bright for an LED.  AND, guess what? This is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes!Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack.I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this.
I was impressed by all the reviews that said that how quiet the machine was when I bought it.  Assembly was not so bad (2.5 hours).  Then the squeeking started.  Just about after 100 calories burned, there would be a two distinct squeeks at a specific position of the flywheel.  We called technical service and the service person called back on the 5th day (he needed to respond before 5 days) and scheduled a visit for a day 10 days AFTER that.  The technician inspected the machine and said that such sound was normal, and adjusted the tension on some screws and left.  Now the squeeking is starts right after beginning the workout.  It is LOUD.  As in, you need earplugs, loud.  Another call to tech support...
Don't be fooled by the positive posts, I am convinced they are bogus.This is just a cheaply made toy at adult prices.
Need I say more?  The ball flew off with the plastic connector and wound up in the neighbor's yard.  Thankfully no one was hurt
When I saw that most of the critical parts, the ones that bear the brunt of the force were made of plastic, I told my wife "this isn't going to last long."In the very place I had concerns is where mine broke.  A simple metal pin, instead of a plastic one would have made all the difference.I also just noticed in these "customer reviews" that right after someone posts a negative review, a positive albeit anonymous review is posted.  That always makes me wonder
Broke first time I used it.When it worked it was highly inaccurate (I own a radar speed detector).  Save your money
The first time I used it, I hit it about 20 times before the ball broke off and went flying into nearby woods.My Mom had ordered it from Sharper Image.  She called them and they said the would replace the ball.  They never did. I have not found a place to order replacement parts.    
I don't recall ever being quite as disappointed with a product as I am with the Swing Groover II. Last night I went to the driving range to check some yardages of my clubs, just so I could verify the accuracy of the Swing Groover.     I was hitting my 5-iron between 180-190 yards most of the time, occasionally hitting 200. My 7-iron was flying about 165 yards. Tonight, I just finished setting up the Swing Groover. My first few swings with a 5-iron produced readings of 133 yards. I warmed up a little more and started hitting the 7-iron. These swings produced readings of 121 yards, with an average of 121.    This product is designed to indicate swing speed and yardage hit. The yardage is off by about 50 yards, but believe it or not, I think the swing speed indicator is probably pretty accurate. With the 5-iron, it was indicating a little over 70 mph. I've had my speed tested before with the driver and it registered a little over 100 mph, so this number of 71-73 with the 5-iron sounds reasonable.     I'm not sure if I just got a defective machine or what exactly the problem is, but I'm very disappointed. I'm very inclined to think I just wasted $150.    My suggestion is to keep looking for other products, because this one is horribly inaccurate
Hydrolized Gelatin is the 3rd ingredient after the chocolate coating and protein blend.  Do a search on that and you'll discover that it comes from processing pork skins and cow bones.  Mmmmm. Doesn't that sound good?  What's more - this gelatin protein is incomplete, so it doesn't really do anything to help grow or repair muscles.  It may taste OK, but you can find protein bars with higher quality protein in them. Or just eat Jello if you really want gelatin. Avoid ones with collagen too.  Same issue
I ordered a wobble balance board from Everyting Fitness and it came from Karate Depot and doesn't even look like the product I ordered.  I only give 1 star, because I can't give zero starts
While this is a cheap product and worked great for the first application/session use of 20 min, the second time I tried to use it the belt failed after 5 min.  Even after getting new batteries (which turned out NOT to be the problem) I tried to get the belt to work like before but realized I was "scammed".  It is a cheap plastic belt that seems to be the answer to all your problems but really just creates new ones
I really think I wasted money for buying this stuff.....it's just worthless and not working at all.
Yes, you'll feel your muscles contracting. If they were really contracting to a  degree worthy of being called exercise, the contractions would scare the heck out of you: You'd either feel like your whole core was paralyzed or you'd be going into an spastic, involuntary crunch. Don't worry, that won't happen. The machine isn't strong enough. (Try this: Tense up your abs..more..a little more...relax and do it again a few times, for a minute or so...thats already WAY more exercise than you'll get from the 'Ab Sonic'.) If you're a therapy patient who has a poor muscular awareness, perhaps this will help you begin to get enough feeling back to move on to a real exercise program. If your spinal cord is severed, this may be all you can do to get a little musuclar stimulation...fine. This is not exercise. It may 'remind' you to tense your abs in order to not look like a fat slob, but why not just remind -yourself-? It's not powerful enough to do do any real strengthening, and even if it was, it by-passes the most important part of your  workout: the will. You  aren't learning the effort of tensing the muscles, or tolerating greater stress, you're just electronically agitating the muscles. In the end, this has ZERO effect on strength, muscular development, work tolerance, and function. Are you in therapy? No? Then why are you trying -so hard- to avoid -moving- your body
I received a phone msg. from the vendor two days after I ordered this item from Amazon. A day after I received an email advising that they could not ship my order to a california address, and if I had another address outside  California to ship it to. I thought it was strange since I only have one address. I was looking forward to geting this item too..
I bought this item based on other people's reviews. I'm sad to say they were wrong. Maybe it's just my individual toy but it really did not work properly out of the box. The gun starts doublefeeding pellets as soon as I started firing it. It sprayed pellets in everywhich direction except for where they were supposed to go. My recommendation, well, just look at my title.
When I got this gun, I thought it looked really cool, but when I tried to shoot it, the bullets just rolled out of the barrell!  The few bullets that did shoot worked well.  I did not have a good experience with this gun
Let me just start by saying this gun is terrible. The images are misleading; the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic, but it is a dull black. And it smells really badly at first. Not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps, and is sold at 300. My friends didn't even notice being shot. I have a 300 fps pistol, it leaves welts through jeans. This ISNT 300 fps. It's a rifle fit for an infant who's been dropped on their head and thinks it's good. never even shot farther than 80+ feet. bad buy
I bought this elliptical three month ago unwilling to pay big bucks (over $1,000) for recommended models, hoping to make an exclusion from the rule.No, it did not happened. Starting with the errors in assemble instrucions in the manual, inaccurate display readings, and so on, ending with a squicky and noisy piece of ... equipment.Their customer service is just a place to order parts, although they sent me some parts I broke when assemling - a threat on the bolt, a couple of broken (by me) plastic part. I noticed that I'm using this machine more rarely because I just don't like the way it works.If I new what I was going to get, I did not buy it
I bought this for my wife because of it's low cost. You get what you pay for. She uses it a few times a week. After a little more then a month, the left pedal broke. She is not overweight at all, so that wasn't the problem.I'll spend the money for a good one next time
This is a very heavy machine so make sure you have help if it is going up the stairs.  It is fairly quiet, not silent.  It is shakier than I had hoped.  The wire to the monitor came broken. 
I recently purchased the Stamina Elliptical. It took me a day and a half to put together. The meter didn't work so I called customer service and they sent another one out immediately. It makes a lot of noise and it's not very sturdy. I would return it but it would take too long to dis-assemble. I wouldn't recommend this product.
I bought this pedometer for myself, and bought my wife a $20 Omron pedometer, and hers' is far superior. Easier to set up, more accurate, durable. Lesson: spend a few dollars more for something that works well. This one is disposable junk
This imported 'sword' is actually a long dagger, about the size of a WWII-era bayonet.  In the scabbard it is all of 15 inches.  The construction, fitment of parts, finish, and overall quality is poor.  Definitely a mass-produced, low quality item.  The blade is plain stainless steel and would not hold an edge.  It would properly be labeled a "Masonic-ish" sword as the symbolism on the handle, guard, and scabbard do not strictly conform to those of any branch of Masonry.  There are prominent red crosses and a few Knights Templar-ish symbols but no one that knows anything about Masonry would mistake this for a genunine implement.The blade is sharply pointed so this is NOT something children should play with!  It looks okay hanging on the wall (in the scabbard) but that is about all it is good for.  The price is not a bargain, it is about right for a Chinese-made import of this size and quality.As long as you don't expect more that what I have described, you might like this item
If it is kept in the hilt, it makes for a decent wall piece.  If you pull it out of the hilt, it is not a good thing.My sword has a bent blade, and a bent handle, which was noticable while in the hilt.I would not spend the money on this item
If you need a "starter" or "disposable" bike carrier, this might be okay, but not suitable for longer trips or valuable bikes.Good parts:Cheap, $99Bad parts:1.  Cheap2.  The adapter for a 2" reciever hitch is horrible, you'll have to shim it, jury-rig something, or go to a parts store and pay for a workable one.3.  Way too much sway, which is obvious as you put it together.  Turning corners in town have you checking your mirrors with concern.  Multiply the effect for highway speeds or bumps.  Would need to rig something.4.  Straps holding the bikes.  Cheap, rough on your bike, and not very tight.In summary, if you want to spend alot of time rigging it up to save a few bucks, it might be worth it, but out of the box, I wouldn't trust any worthwhile bike or vehicle with it
I gave this product one star because it was the lowest option. What I really give it is this: WARNING! The outback hitchback 4 product is a dangerous piece of junk. I installed it on my Suburban (which required the - needs to be redesigned - adaptor to 2 inch) and put one full-sized and three kid bikes on it. It swayed a range of 10-12 inches newly installed. My wife  had went on the Target web site earlier and read that the sway was normal. By the time I had traveled 1/3 of the way back to the Bay Area from LakeTahoe (in the middle of the night) I noticed in the lights of the car behind me the hub of the full sized bike wheel sticking out from the side of the vehicle. I pulled over in the dark and checked it out. Due to the constant side-to-side motion of the winding mountain roads the main metal braket had bent and the sway had increased to a now dangerous 2 feet! Needless to say the rest of the four hour trip was nerve racking. Roping the rack to try and stabilize it. I'm taking the rack back to Target
The first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame.  Two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit.  The seller forwarded the photos and complaint to Texsport and they sent us another top.  When we put that top on we found the same thing.  That is when we found the frame was 4" longer than the top.  There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner.  After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together.  When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product
I got this Zafu(meditation cushion.) It is round in shape and too  high and bulky to be comfortable to sit on, around 9 inches high and 15-18 inches in diameter. It is also pretty heavy, around 4 pounds due to the sheer size.I could not sit comfortably on it due to this reason returned it. I would recommend trying it somewhere before buying.The filling seemed of good quality
IT WORKS LIKE A HOOK FOR CLOTHES OF MY WIFE ;
I got this item to give a a gift.  I got it fast, however opened the bag to find out the zipper was completely broken.  It wasn't worth returning it because if you've opened it you can only get a 50% refund and have to pay shipping, which would have cost more than what I would have been refunded.  Don't bother with this one
Three of these broke.  Granted the company sent me two replacements for nothing after the first one failed, but to no avail.  My wife received something similar from SPRI (doctor's tubing) and it has lasted for a few years now
I might be an idiot, but maybe this thing should have come with some instructions on how to put it on! Haha. So many velcro straps and what not. Neither me nor my father who's been on the police force for 30 some odd years could figure out how to put this thing on properly. Again....maybe I'm just an idiot....
The literature describes this unit as a flat-mount ski rack compatible with any factory-installed roof rack with crossbars.  Hardly.My vehicle is a 2006 GMC Envoy with a factory roof rack.  This rack is the same one used on many GM SUVs, so great numbers of them are out there.  These racks have crossbars with a "reverse wing" shape that are tilted forward, presumably to reduce wind noise.  The Thule "universal" mounting system will not conform to these crossbars, and will only mount with the ski rack tilting forward (or backward) at a silly angle.  It can be used in this conformation, but it looks odd.Also, the ski rack indeed locks over the skis/boards, but the mounts are not lock-protected, so the entire ski rack and contents can be easily stolen with standard wrenches.My searches found no alternative to this rack, however, and it does work for the intended purpose
This is a $22 tee ball? Maybe they have the decimal in the wrong place, since these should cost about $2 at your local sporting goods store. Maybe they comes 10 or 12 to a package (but it doesn't say that clearly on the page).Bottom line is don't buy this until they clarify the pricing issue
I was unable to use this treadmill for several reasons. One, the belt will not stay centered. It shifts to one side and then starts rubbing on the metal guides intended to keep it centered. If I were able to get the belt to turn with out a large amount of force, the second problem, it would soon be torn by the guides. As I said the second problem is the belt will not move without a lot of force. I had to lean over and put so much force down that after only 3 minutes my legs were cramping. If I tried to stand up and just walk normally the belt would not move. Also like others several of the plastic knobs were broken and it was either a used unit or the numerous scratches happened during shipping
This is the worst purchase I have made from Amazon or anyone else. The "first" unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable. After a number of calls to tech support, it was decided to return and replace the unit. Amazon promptly replaced the treadmill. This one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function. My friend at tech support did not have a clue. He suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit. It is not clear what I am to do with them. I strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer
This is not as described..it is very hard to move - heavy and bulky. If you have a place to set it up and leave it, fine, but this is not going to be pulled out every day for a 'stroll in front of the TV', as described.  Performance-wise it seems very nice and is a good solid piece of equipment, but definitely not an item that can be put away after each use.  I'm disappointed
After 2 attempts at having this shipped to me, and both times having it arrive broken.  I have given up this model.  It's a shame that the poor packaging on the machine is the reason for the rowers rating.  If you can buy one at the store, it may be a great unit, but don't let it go UPS
This is not the fault of Amazon or even the product. I wasused to a gym quality rower (conceptII) which allows a lot of resistance.  The Integrity 3000 allows for hardly any resistance.  I am in the process of sending it back.  The machine itself was good but did not offer enough of a challenge.  An expensive lesson
The goal arrived at my house assembled wrong, then after it was fixed be me, I successfully put it together, which was relativly easy.  After several moderately hard training sessions two large holes were in the net.  That is on top of the fact that the pins that hold the net together are weak.  The weakness in the pins causes the goal to collapse if there is a shot off of the post.  Overall, this is probably not a good buy.
I own two, and have had problems with both. Even when pre-heated, coffee/ tea is luke warm 3 hours later. Sturdy product--should be for it is pretty heav
Prior to purchasing this item, I read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe.  I wish I heeded this advice because, on top of fasciitis, I developed severe toe pain by using this product.  I then had to by a second product anyway that, thankfully, eliminated the toe pain.  Even though this is less expensive than other night splints, it may do more harm than good.  Go with a firm, non-toe injurying splint instead
Maybe the S120 will work for you, but it was nothing but trouble for me.  I bought it because of the great features and price, but returned it because of all the problems: 1) The manual is anything but friendly, e.g. after completing the 11 steps to set the date you are then told that there's a short cut.  Thanks.  2) After spending much more than an hour with the manual just to get the basic settings in, I'm off to exercise.  Great start, the reading is my usual pulse around 55, then it drops out to 0.  Ok, maybe the contacts are too dry, so I wet them.  Off I go again and the pulse rate measures 204 then to 0.  Ok, maybe the chest strap is positioned poorly.  Different position, same result -- measured pulse rates all over the map.  I decide to forget what the monitor records and finish my exercise.  Final result -- I got periods of reasonable heart rates, but lots of time the values were either 0 or over 190.  The next day I try again with the same result -- drop outs and then sky high readings.  It went back later that day
I ordered the Igloo quick and cool 150 from Target. I had it 2 days after ordering. It was a very nice cooler but very clearly quite used. Back it went. Be careful ordering from Target in January. They have to do something with those Christmas returns. Check out the product carefully.
The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it
This airbed leaked slowly from day one. I sent it back and got an exact replacement that also had a slow leak from day one. I do not recommend this product.
Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick. Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness. Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever. Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one
LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIGHT FLASHLIGHTS. THE PARTY THAT SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH CHARGE DURING SHIPPINS IS A LITTLE SHAKING IN THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF OF SHAKING BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A GLIMMER OF LIGHT. AFTER THAT IF YOU DON'T CONTINUE TO SHAKE IT DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY.THIS LIGHT MAY POSSIBLY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE BUT THERE ARE OTHER LED FLASHLIGHTS WITH BATTERIES THAT ARE SUPERIOR TO THIS ONE. THE POWER USED BY THESE LEDS IS LOW AND THE BATTERIES LAST A LONG TIME.
I have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one.This one puts out a a poor amount of light. It also does not retain its charge well.  You will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged.I would say it is one of the worst ones I purchased
It holds my bike but seems unstable - I still can't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car, and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards.  Plus, probably the biggest concern - there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack (user must tie the bike down every time).  My bike hasn't fallen off though..
The light came without the batteries that were supposed to be included.  Batteries were very difficult to find and quite expensive.  Even with batteries the xenon light did not work.  So now I have a very expensive led flashlight with hard to replace batteries.  The case was nice however
If you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles, and pins while camping, then this is the item for you. The instructions are made only to confuse things more. It could be made so much more user friendly.Once it's up, it gets a thumbs up.
Not strong enough to hold even 2 gallons of water in a shower.  This is shown with a shower hanging in it but the only way it would hold it is empty.  Not usable as a shower.  Good if you are looking for privacy or changing room but not for a shower
This product does not work.  The vendor is great though.   They refunded our money very quickly.   We were very disappointed because it is a great idea. 
I already have a good quality FitBall stability ball that I really like and only bought this set to get the DVD. I had planned to give the ball to a family member, but unfortunately it is of poor quality and not burst resistant, so it will probably just get thrown out.  The included pump is a piece of junk, so even if you do want to use the low quality ball, you'll need to find another way to inflate it.  Finally, Mindy Mylrea is a good instructor, but the music  sound quality were lacking and I ended up not liking the workout, so in the end I got rid of the dvd as well.
I love the workout dvd that comes with it - but the ball developed a slow leak after only a few uses.  Very disappointed with this product
Do not order from this company, as amount will be charged to your account(as mine was), and I never got the item.......I emailed the company and never heard a word...Amazon is crediting my account after I made a complaint. Unsatisfactory company......................................
Now I am a firm believer that breakfast is a very important time in your day. Yesterday morning I was driving to the dentist's office when I realized that I had forgotten to eat. I started to have quite an anxiety attack, so I pulled over at the only available place. A Gas Station. Nothing really caught my eye as something I would like to put inside my body. Now this was no ordinary Gas Station. This was a special kind of one where they had hot food behind the counter, including supreme-pizza, chicken drum-sticks, and even breakfast-style food, like a little sausage-egg-buiscuit-combo-sandwich. Sure, the food smelled alright, but the thought sickened me that one of the mechanics or gas-pumpers may have had oil, grease, or even gasoline on their hands when preparing these dishes. While I was peering over the counter, trying to scope out just how filthy their hands were, something to my left caught my eye. It was a golden box of something called a "Powerbar". The name had me sold immediately (a food that creates power), and they were even individually sealed to prevent the repulsive hands of the workers from contaminating them. "I'm going to eat a POWERBAR" was the only thought on my mind as I purchased 4 of them on the spot. I hopped back in my VW Cabrio and sped off down Livernois towards the dentist's office. I unwrapped one of the Powerbars. It looked just like a normal candy-bar but the name told a different story. Just how much endurance and stamina would one of these provide, and for how long? What kind of advantages would I gain? I thought I had found my new favorite food. Finally, a food that defines Howard Tuttleman as a person. That is, until I took my first bite. My first bite literally took me 2 minutes to chew up enough to be able to work it down my throat. It was a tough rubbery nugget inside the chocolate that stretched out a bit like taffy. Every bite had the same grimy and bitter flavor, with an atrocious after-taste. My mouth felt like I had ingested a whole bottle of Elmer's glue, and every crevice between my teeth was gummed up with it. I reluctantly continued to eat the entire bar. My stomach began to feel as if I had eaten lead. I felt no extra power in my body. If anything, the Powerbar significantly weakened me by making me feel ill. I was convinced that I had simply picked a bad Powerbar, so I unwrapped another one to give it a second chance. By this time I was in the Dentist's parking lot. If I went in now, I could make the appointment on time, but I had to try for more Power. Big mistake. The second Powerbar was no different. It felt like the Powerbars were fighting my stomach. I finished the second Powerbar, feeling even worse. My third Powerbar however was the worst of the bunch. It was a different flavor, and I nearly threw-up. I felt 20 pounds heavier. My teeth and lips felt like I had been eating drywall, and were covered in chocolate and grimy nugget. I simply could NOT eat more than 2 bites of the fourth one, no matter how much I tried. It was time to go inside. My dentist was a little ticked-off that I was late, and got really annoyed about all of the Powerbar remains stuck in my teeth. Apparently I wasn't supposed to eat for a while before my appointment. I felt sick for the rest of the day. I gave my dog (Morris) the rest of the 4th Powerbar to see if it would work on a dog, but it just made his butt really powerful that night and was a real pain to clean up after. Please beware, the name of this product is deceptive, unless it is supposed to mean that the Powerbar ITSELF is powerful, and will overpower YOU. Later. howardtuttleman.co
I am disappointed with this product as I thought I was ordering the stretchout strap which is all nylon and very durable which I give to my patients. This one is made of nylon and elastic. The stitching broke within 2 days of minimal use. The elastic may be more comfortable on the hands but the stitching is poor quality and just fell apart. Go with the Stretch Out Strap which I have been very pleased with
how can this table be used with FACE HOLE?either -- 1) use no sheets, ie client lies directly on vinyl,   or 2) fitted sheet covers hole, ie client cannot breathe.Neither of these 2 options is even remotely acceptable
Disliked table.  Each time table was set-up, legs had to be attached by the support rods.  This was not an easy process nor done quickly.  The face hole in table was not useful to me and was very uncomfortable.  1 Star for this item is too much for my usage and review.  I sent it back
We have in the past owned an In Step single jogger.  It wasn't perfect but it certainly met our needs.  It always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside.  If we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it.  After being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling.  We purchased the In Step Run Around LTD 2 Jogging Stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs.  The problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller.  My husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break... it doesn't stop the stroller and barely even slows it down.  It took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger.  After that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride.  When placing them in we encountered our next problem... the seats even at the highest point are super reclined.  They wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other. As for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle. So off we set on our test drive.  It was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn.  After a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger.  The only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position, criss-cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell "Stay down kids...if you sit up one more time I'm going to sit in it and make you push me!"  Well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart.  I don't recommend this item.  In all honesty our Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon does the job more effectivel
I ditto the previous reviewer...i thought these seats were adjustable, was I wrong, there is only 1 position and that is practically laying down..suck
We know strollers!!  This is our 5th stroller over 4 kids.  We decided to try a dually.Pros:Plenty of room for 2 children both about 25 pounds.  "Cute"CONS:We're reviewing what we consider to be an expensive stroller.  In our opinion the added expense shouldn't equal just an extra seat, but better design and higher quality.1)  While the dimensions are listed in the description, the relative size to every day objects are not discussed.  Objects, like say, doors.  This stroller won't fit through 90% of the doors in the world.  You basically had better only expect that it go through the front door of your house or plan on Parking it in the garage next to your suburban.  The doorway must be a 3'0 door (36  inches wide).  That's usually only your front door.    Forget about pushing into or out of any interior doorways which are generally much smaller.2)  The straps are awful.  Again, our 4th stroller.  Worse one of all.  Incredibly, incredibly difficult to use.  I'm actually flabergasted at how difficult the straps are.  Despite having tightened them up as tight as possible, the two year old was out in under 10 minutes (once she decided to be out).3)  Impossible to allow the children to sit up.  Again, adjusting the straps to the utmost, the angle of the backrest remains extremly steep.  Perhaps to counter balance the lack of effective straps?4)  Hand brake is setup for the left hand.  Appears to be reversible if you want to work on it.5)  Hood can not be lowered to cover front of children.  If say, you are walking into the sun (morn or evening), the kids are completely exposed.Conclusion:Very frustrating buy.  Wouldn't recommend it at all
This was one of our worst purchases. Rental gear that we have used on previous vacations works better! The snorkle and mask were constant problems, leaking, filling with water, etc. We had to stop snorkling every few minutes and finally just gave up.
If your looking for cheap snorkel equipment this is the way to go, but the fins are low quality and I would only wear them if I wanted to get laughed at
the jacket works well for shedding water which isn't really losing positive weight. the pants rip during the first work out. i've purchased two of these hoping in good faith that the pants woouldn't rip. but they did. save your money unless you just want to jacket.
received this suit yesterday and used today for first time.  you do sweat but as one of the other reveiwers mentioned i took off the pants and they tore horizontally thru the crotch seam.. one wearing and kaput.written to valeo will see what they repl
The suit will make you sweat if that's what you are looking to do.  I had rivers running out of my sleeves and pant legs, but the pants tore within weeks on the inside seam.  I was using the suit about 5 times a week with a vigorous treadmill routine.  It will likely last longer and be fine for occasional recreational uses, but buy something more substantial for a serious workout.  You truly do get what you pay for
 I received the exercise bike, put it together as soon as I got it,  and started using it. Just looking at it I had second thoughts about buying it. Ten minutes later it broke. Some part in this cheaply made product broke on the inside. I contacted the guys who sold this to me to get my money back but they never got back to me. One more thing. Even if it hadn't broken, the resistance setting on this thing is horrible. You get absolutely no resistance on it. That means no workout
Received the bike in our office as a possible incentive for our wellness program and no one was able to use it.  You can't get it to pedal.  The cheaper way is not the way to go on this type of bike.  You need a heavier base and very smooth cycling.  This model runs on a fabric type band on the inside. MADE VERY CHEAP.  I DON'T RECOMMEND
This tiny item ships for $2 more than it costs. I'll purchase it elsewhere
