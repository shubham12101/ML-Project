really tried like via michelin bought every intention loving march feel compelled tell keep shopping bought due excellent price small thin size compared garmin thought bad ordered shipped door took mile trip gps units cars family members already trips bought one budget gps optimistic new chip long hated unit criticms reviews came back haunt tell first please note positive reviews unit noticed mostly people no experience gps units spend much time reviewed experience gps years like century terms fast technology changing positive reviewers first newer gps comparing car navigational gps years ago yes quite bit better compared new units like mio tom tom one viamichelin horrible user interface horrible use roads tomtom mio often finish typing intuitive programmers polished viamichelin very non intuitive absolutely dangerous try use fly sure not supposed use drive one truly dangerous even learn complicated system time pull work no fun even program go another screen loses program history soon frustrated many steps unit takes anything lost often gets try give pros :p ros small form factor decent screen sirf chip navteq maps four hour battery life good price sirf chip horrible non intuitive software program clunky multi step interface make life horrible rush emergency even not hurry horrible speaker volume poor speaker poor hear road noise present seriously turn speaker way driving crackle illegible read review honestly believe owned third unlike gps one literally tells start driving tell way go routed nearest store etc think means sometimes chance making right choice way go guess wrong tells turn around go way seriously one feature enough make say no gps least tell turn right parked turn left one say start driving without direction seem route drive onto road parking lot already satellite location not software bugaboo think built programming makes start driving find location know way going start routes direction traveling bad software design sure go canada installed another sd card canadian map very inconvenient cross border navteq maps could not find many locations coastal maine literally driving coastal roads said not exist found very slow recalculating trips missed turn much slower than mio purchasd last year tom tom one purchased year recalculation problem busy city traffic caused us miss several critical exits want find run forget many steps illogical organization compared major brands often could not find even local walmarts years serious parked front walmarts could not find very old walmarts sure garmin tomtom mio not list walmarts least get home town not via several towns maine connecticut parked front rows old stores years punch local stores difficult use poi list find also punch look stores like nearest walmart mio tom tom no problems finding several nearest ones knew location via within certain distance not show existing figure next town search location try find store very very clunky tell much trouble simple units get spoiled garmin tomtoms one makes hard still find no gps finds stores limit course seems via programmers spent time gathering addresses bank not restaurants shopping etc believe used trip organized make believe programmers never actually used gps say enough difficult interface go back forward another screen often loses start programming going going multiple difficult steps lose power start bought read negative positive reviews thought bad thought complaining people probably not techie complaining no reason wrong experienced gps users ones know clunky bad software interface compared sleek garmin tom tom interfaces example one trip daughter began throw find emergency medical treatment facility clunky interface made very difficult locate one panicked want quickly find nearest hospital unit makes put town etc than x miles like interstate literally guessing town search find hospital horrible happen mio clicks bam searched found nearest hospital one click routed nearest hospital truly sad not recommend viamichelin really recommend pass like reviewers suggested recommend buy rapid easy use mio great screen blazing fast sirf calculating chip tech challenged buy garmin awesome easy use software interface buy bad speakered horrible interfaced poorly designed buggy unit paper looks like killer unit reality unpolished clunky paper tiger horrible use finally fun factor tomtom one fun mio fast fun pleasure use even newer fun simplicity hated screen old garmins viamichelin x no fun programmed not pleasure use although take across country believe pleasure low price quickly fade start working unhearable speaker unpolished unfun clunky interface poorly organized features disorganized menus polished quick intuitive menu garmin tomtom shine thing better viamichellin screen older use older satellite gps chip than viamichellin new via use gps satellite chip faster software routines cpu chips even use sirf chip via michelin cannot make poor software menu design theoretically thing blazing fast much slower than tomtom mio thing better unit than mio via smaller thinner maybe navteq maps might slightly better locals than mio wins hands far faster better easier use gps opinion looking software ease go garmin first mio via last looking value great unit go mio killer unit hackable looking simplicity programming going go garmin first tried mr viamichelin need go finishing school like gps students unfinished rough
